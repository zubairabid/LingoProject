Enron will offer exhibits 6 and 15 in this proceeding, the direct and rebuttal testimony of Jeffrey Dasovich.

Wild Goose Storage Inc. will offer exhibits 9 and 16, the direct and rebuttal testimony of Paul Amirault.

Counsel for Enron and WGSI estimate a maximum of 2 hours for SCGC Witness Yap, 2 hours for Aglet Witness Weil and 2 hours for TURN Witness Florio. These estimates are subject to being reduced as a result of coordination with other counsel supporting the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement.  We do not anticipate any cross examination of other witnesses, but seek to reserve the right to ask a very limited number of questions if any witness offers testimony on the stand addressing the interests of Enron or WGSI in a manner different from their prepared testimony.

Enron and WGSI do not seek to strike any testimony.
