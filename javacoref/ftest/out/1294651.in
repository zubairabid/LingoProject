The update on Goldman Sachs/J Aron Master Netting Agreement is that the legal form of the document has been agreed to with their inside counsel. We are waiting for Credit (Houston)'s approval before circulating for signature. I spoke with Tanya R. today. She said she would speak to Bill about GS' request to sign the cross-affiliate netting agreement w/o collateral. With Bill's approval, we can circulate for signature.
