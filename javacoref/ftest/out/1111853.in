To follow-up with some other thoughts --
1.	We focused the discussions on the lack of action by the NAERO board.  I mentioned the lack of action on Independence of Security Coordinators.  Anderson responded by indicating that they weren't ready to go there because weren't quite sure if they could get the industry to agree - made our point.  Also, pointed out that the old agreement was only if comprehensive legislation is passed.
2.	Rick used the analogy that NAERO has done nothing to earn our deference to their legislation.  Jeff used the FASB - SEC model as an example of what a good relationship could look like.  Why should we support anointing NERC to the post while they have done nothing to "earn our respect".
3.	Dave Cook discussed the problems with PJM - (1) canada involvement, (2) FERC didn't have technical staff.  I don't think that the Canada problem was too great.  The other issue seems to play right into the point - there will be alot of deference to a group on technical matters but getting the independence right is important.
4.	While Jeff indicated that PJM is better, Rick highlighted that we weren't agreeing to that either.  Still problems (such as funding).
5.	I still don't like the term SRO - selfregulating standards organiation.  Should just be a standards organization.
Anderson is calling Rick to set up a meeting between Jeff and the NAERO board.
