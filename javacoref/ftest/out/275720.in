FYI - the issue of whether Europe are able to aggregate their positions, calculate VaR appropriately and report to Houston is aquiring heat since they committed to do it by May 10th and its now May 9th.
I understand the natural defensive reaction (I've been there myself) but I don't think citing policy gaps for not having it done is helpful at this stage.
