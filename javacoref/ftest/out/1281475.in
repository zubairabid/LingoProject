FYI, the ESC Voting and Bylaws task force I have been working on is planning to attend.  I think they are also going to try to bring up their work as an example if they are given the chance to speak.  Attached is the latest bylaws I have been working on with them.
Mark Scheel and I managed to convince everyone a six-sector voting model was more appropriate:
Generation Merchants
Marketers
Load Serving Entities and TDUs
End-Use Customers
Transmission Providers
RTOs, ISOs, and RROs
This will hopefully provide a better balance than the 9-sector model proposed by NERC.
