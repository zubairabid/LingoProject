Dear Team Members:

I have scheduled one last cultivation dinner in Austin for April 17 at Louie's 106.

Full-time and intern analysts will be invited (about 30 total).  This is a great chance to see both groups before they begin their careers at Enron.

Please let me know if you are interested in attending.


Thank you!
