The new P&L is in the following directory under NT Explorer:
M:/Electric/24hour/application/PandLNew.exe.  There have been many great
ideas and suggestions on how to handle the new reorg.  There is one thing to
remember in all of this, we are still a team and even though you have your
own p&l for whatever region that you are responsible for we are all still
responsible for Enron.  Below is a list or guidelines on how to handle the
different situations.

The hourly books are Northeast Hourly, Midwest Hourly, Southeast Hourly, and
Ercot Hourly.  There is no more Short Term Hourly or Short Term Hourly
Management.

1. Any incremental deals that are done will go into the P&L and EnPower under
the SINKS region and at the end of the shift there will be an annuity done
between the appropiate regions.  For example:   AEP-TVA-SOCO  Everything will
go in the Southeast Hourly book.  Then Southeast Hourly will do an annuity to
give Midwest Hourly their share.  Everything will be split down the middle.

2. Any positions that we inherit will go into the region where the position
is and then there will be a Book Transfer done to balance everyone.  For
example:  ENWC is long 100 mw's.  The transmission and sell will go in the
Midwest Hourly P&L and Book in EnPower and then a Book Transfer will be done
between Midwest Hourly and whatever book that the position is in.

3. We had a situation today where Hourly Northeast wanted to buy the ENWC
position to take to PJM and his bid was better than the market.  The correct
way to handle this would be that Hourly Midwest  to sell Horly Northeast the
power at ENWC. Hourly Northeast   would put a buy from Midwest Hourly, the
transmission, and the PJM sell in the Northeast Hourly book  and P&L.
Midwest Hourly would put a sell to Northeast Hourly in their P&L and book and
then would do a Book Transfer with the responsible book of the ENWC position.

It is very important that we learn EnPower like the back of our hands.  Tresa
Allen's group will no longer baby sit us, it is now our responsiblity.  It is
crucial that you understand what book that positions are in,  Some positions
could be in multiple books. Corry has told me that the scheduler's will try
to put what books are responsible for what positions on their lotus notes
that they put out.  You can also look the deals up in EnPower.  EnPower is a
process that shows how acurate you are and whether or not you can pay
attention to detail.

If you have any questions please let me know I am available 24/7.
