In response to the email distributed last  Fridayregarding IEP's intervention
in the EOB and CALPX price cap filings at  FERC, IEP is proceeding to draft
comments on the EOB filing. Much of the  filing will build off arguements
used in the San Diego pleading as well as  comments IEP made to the
Congressional Subcommittee meetings in San Diego.  In addition, IEP has
intervened for "party status" in the CALPX proceeding on  price caps.
We plan to distrubute comments on Thursday,  convene a conference call
Friday, Sept. 15 at 10:00 a.m.  (PST).
The Call-In Number is    800/205-3434
The Participant Code  is  111756
IEP is still interested in receiving Task Force  commitments to assist in
restructuring/transmission related matters. While  a numberr of companies
have indicated verbally their interest in the EOB filing  as well as others,
we have yet to receive a written confirmation. If you  are interested,
please respond to the Friday email soliciting funds.  Thanks.
