The commercial teams at EES need to understand our opinion / perspective on
if Direct Access customers in the future will pay any surcharges.   Also, who
can we contact in CPUC and legislature or governor office to verify?

To make this make sense, I think that we need to think about this on a
"revenue item" basis (eg, Utility Undercollection from x date to y date).

Why not discuss on CA call tomorrow?

Some notes from Order ---

The surcharge adopted in D. 01-03-082 is intended to provide payment for DWR
purchases which do not include purchases made by direct access customers.  By
this exemption we intend to &net out8 the charges and credits of direct
access customers.

1. Direct access customers do not impose liabilities on CDWR, PG&E or Edison
for procuring power.
It would be inequitable for direct access customers to pay for their own cost
of procurement and a share of the costs incurred on behalf of customers who
purchase power from PG&E, Edison and CDWR.

1. The credit that direct access customers receive shall not reflect the
surcharges imposed on others by today,s decision, which direct access
customers do not pay.
