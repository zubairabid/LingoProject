Here is the list for Friday's positions.  To give you an update on what the daily calcs are used for, information from RisktRAC and CAS is being pulled on an ad hoc basis to fulfill requests from both external and internal personnel/companies.  As such, books with any positions should be calced as often as possible.
Also for the 31st, my understanding after talking to several groups is that certain groups have only limited resources right now and will not be able to provide accurate calcs for the 31st before late this week or early next week.  Please keep me up to date on the status of your information.  Once all books have been calced, officialized, and exported (to Athena) for the 31st we will rerun VAR and produce a DPR.
Open questions:
Cindy - lets discuss what should be done for ECTRIC on an ongoing basis as well as for the 31st.
Kori - do any of the books listed with you as the BA have positions - if not we can inactivate them
Jeff - there are a couple of gas books that seem to have positions, NG-PR-OPT-PRC (which is inactive) and NG-PRICE-GDL.  Who can I get the status from for these?
Thanks

PS:  When you review the information regarding CAS - no position means no 3rd party position.  Since not all groups have deleted their intercompany positions, there may be books listed below as "no position" which do have VAR/P&L risk.
