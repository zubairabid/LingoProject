FYI---one of the many,many articles that have come out over the past few
days.  This one captures the essence of most of them.  See in particular the
part I have highlighted.

General reaction in the business community is that Enron must be crazy to
have worked this hard to beat the competition, only to withdraw just as the
project becomes real.  The phones continue to ring constantly.

At the same time, we have just received the official notification from the
Saudis that we have been awarded, after what is being described as "fierce
competition", a piece of Core Venture 2.  We have already wired this with Oxy
and will exit this week in a manner that hopefully protects the relationships
that we have built with the Saudis----but the timing (exactly the same time
that we are withdrawing from Dolphin and filing a termination notice for
Dabhol) does not help.

As you might expect, the mood in the office is terrible----the team is proud
of the fact that they started with nothing two years ago have accomplished
the impossible against great odds (beating the competition in Dolphin, Saudi,
SADAF and Oman, as well as putting together a world-class LNG supply system
for Dabhol) only to have it all fall apart with what is perceived as limited
redeployment potential and little PRC support because of the "ex EI" stigma.

Over the next several days we must work through the UOG Dolphin press
announcements, Saudi (we must notify Saudi of our intentions by Wednesday),
explanations regarding Dolphin to all of those that have helped us (e.g.,
U.S. embassy and our local sponsors) and, as luck would have it, the Dubai
government wants to proceed with the Jebel Ali Aluminum/electricity deal (I
suspect that they will change their mind over the next several days as events
unfold).

In addition, we have employee meetings on Tuesday to reduce the size of the
Dubai/Houston team from 35 to 11.

The next several days are not going to be fun....
