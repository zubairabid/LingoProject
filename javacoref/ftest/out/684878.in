As indicated by this ex parte notice, Edison is planning to meet with Bilas
this week before the continuation meeting on Thursday presumably to try to
weaken his opposition to the July 1 cut off of direct access.  Edison's
comments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load has
switched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,
resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access over
their entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strong
proponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing the
DWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, should
Enron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to prevent
any backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  A
meeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with his
advisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.
