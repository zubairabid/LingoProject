Jim,
I have sent a copy of the T4 permit revision that was sent to the RRCT in May of this year for the HPL Compression Company facility--Permit #05561.  As I noted on the cover letter, AEP must submit a new P5 which identifies their organizational information in order for Kathy Arnold to process the T4 permit for this facility.
