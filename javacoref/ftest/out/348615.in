Attached herewith please find Chairman Bliley's letter to his House Commerce
Committee members outlining the process and content for full committee
mark-up upon Congress' return from the July 4th break; the section-by-section
on transmission plus the actual transmission legislative language are also
attached.  H.R. 2944 is the underlying bill to which these changes are made.

We have made substantial progress just this week.  We will need to be
diligent to determine which amendments will be offered in July and to guard
against those we oppose.  Commerce Committee members are continuing their
meetings this evening to further plan the upcoming mark-up.

The Senate Reliability bill will likely not be considered until Congress
reconvenes in July.  Several Democrat Senators have now placed holds.  Under
the Senate Rules, just one Member can block bill consideration under the hold
process.  At this point, the hold is process vs. substance.

July will be the most critical month in order for us to realize bill
enactment this Congress.
