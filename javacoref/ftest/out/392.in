The path:

West Kootenai (G)-BCH(T)JUANITA/BCUS O#M335781A-WKPL-DYPMI-SNPD(T)BPA(T)BCUS/AVA O#96062 HNF-DYPMI-EPMI-WWP

MONTH LONG TAG 26019

HE 0700-0800 we are warned by SNPD that the transmission MAY BE curtailed to Zero.

When I spoke with Susan at WWP she finds this very suspicious, as it was described to her as a "West of Hatwai" problem she is suspicious of this and is investigating.


Please get with DYPMI and get their re-supplied transmission before this schedule flows in the morning.
