SBX2 78 (Polanco), the MOU opposed by SCE, failed passage in the Senate
Energy Committee.  The bill will be voted on again in committee tomorrow
morning at 9:00 a.m.  If the bill succeeds, it will immediately go to
Appropriations and then the Senate floor.

ABX2 82 (Keeley/Hertzberg), the MOU supported by the Administration, passed
out of the Assembly Energy Committee and the Assembly Appropriations
Committee, largely on a party-line vote.  The first time the bill was voted
on by the Energy Committee it failed passage.  On reconsideration Rod Wright
and Dead Florez switched their votes and the bill passed.  The bill will be
heard on the Assembly floor tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.

ABX2 50 (Wright, Campbell, etc.), the MOU minus transmission, passed out of
the Assembly Energy Committee, largely on a party-line vote.  The bill will
be heard by the Appropriations Committee tomorrow upon call of the chair.

SBX2 18 (Burton), DRC, will be heard by the Senate Energy Committee tomorrow
at 9:00 a.m.  It is my understanding that the Republicans may be supportive
of this measure which requires a 2/3 vote.
