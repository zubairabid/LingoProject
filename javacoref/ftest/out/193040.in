As you know, the mid year PRC process is underway.  The system "officially"
closed for feedback last Friday, 6/1.  The system will remain usable by
supervisors until the PRC process has completed.  Below is a schedule of
other dates that you should be aware of:

6/18  EGM Commercial Support PRC Meeting
6/19  EGM Trading PRC Meeting
6/20  EGM Origination PRC Meeting

6/25  Associate and Analyst PRC Meeting

7/10  EWS Final PRC Meeting
(In this meeting, Mgr and above will be cross-calibrated for all of EWS.
Below Mgr, the curves for each job group will be reviewed at the business
unit level and then overall for EWS.  At the end of this meeting, there will
be a pre-PRC for VP's in preparation for the 7/23 meeting.)

7/23 & 7/24 Executive Committee PRC
(In this meeting, VP's and MD's will be rated relative to their peers
across Enron.)

A few side notes:

Please make sure your employees have completed a self-evaluation.  The
"accomplishments" section of this evaluation is viewable in the PRC meeting
in which the employee is reviewed.  (As of today, the system will still allow
employees to complete the self-evaluation.)

As you are preparing to represent employees in a PRC meeting, be aware that
the consolidated feedback and self-evaluation are printable.

Lastly, if you will be asking any of your direct reports to attend one of
the EGM meetings on 6/19-6/20, please let me know asap.  I must provide a
complete list of meeting participants before we are able to conduct the
meeting.  (Pls. err on the side of less rather than more people while
ensuring that employees receive fair representation).

Please call me (ext. 59386) or Khymberly Booth (ext. 36019) should you have
any additional questions.
