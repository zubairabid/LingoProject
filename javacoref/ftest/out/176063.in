Jim.  I like your suggestions and suggest the following enhancements:
We should integrate this solution into the CPUC process. ie Keep rate freeze
in effect until the Mar 02.  Make state agency take over as ESP to all
bundled customers at 110% of frozen rate.  This solution keeps the current
Rate Freeze in place and keeps us in the game to not lose our negative ctc.
It also corresponds to your minimal changes goal.  It also puts government
agency in the same place as us in having exposure to negative ctc as us.  It
also accomodates the problem of RFP's taking longer than expected.  It also
solves the liquidity problem immediately and avoids the need for
forbearance.  And furthermore it keeps the utility exposed to bankruptcy
which minimizes their negotiating power.
I don't understand how this proposal addreses what happens with the existing
assets of PG&E.  The worry I have is that PG&E gets to keep 50% of the
benefits of nuclear sales and 10% of the benefits of hydro sales, post rate
freeze.  If we damage 1890, the utilities are now in the drivers seat.
re "ESPs should be able to buy from UDCs at the current weighted average
generation rate from 1/1/01 ) 12/31/02 to serve any competitive load in
California"  This suggest a replacement to AB 1890 which suggests significant
changes.  Would it not be better to say "After the rate freeze, the
government entity would take over the obligations of PG&E and continue them
to the end of 2002.  Such assumption and continuation, would be combined with
the government entity recieving the benefits of  the difference between
market prices and embedded costs of the SCE/PG&E existing generation assets.
Summary of Solution that incorporates these suggestions
Government entity becomes an ESP taking over all customers not served by
another ESP.
Government accepts any ESP's that come back within 3 weeks.
Utilities stopped from selling any additional nuclear, hydro, thermal or QF
generation. (requires change in legislation)
Utilities provide surcharge/credit, for the lessor of 40 years or retirement,
based on the difference between generation COS and market value to all ESPs,
after rate freeze ends (requires change in legislation and settlement).
Government entity, as ESP,  charges Frozen Rate plus 10% until the end of
2002.
Government entity, assures all ESP that they will their costs will not exceed
110% of frozen rate until the end of 2002.
Rate freeze and surcharge continue until the end of March 2002.
Any shortfall of agency would be recovered through a amortization over the
next 15 years with securitization less positive proceeds from auctioning
default provider. (requires change in legislation)
Government commit to building 10,000 MW of generation by summer of 2002
Government commit to allowing emmission constrainted generators to buy
emission credits
Goverment change legislation to allow swift DSM activity
