Reminder for today's conference  call...

The Alliance of Energy Suppliers will conduct a conference  call to apprize the generator community of the recent progress of the  Interconnection Agreement and Interconnection Procedures drafting groups  and their work-product, solicit input on content of comments to the ANOPR,  and begin discussion of Phase II- Cost Responsibility and Cost Allocation of  Interconnection Upgrades.

The Alliance's outside counsel, Jonathan Gottlieb,  will  be the co-conductor of this call to provide first-hand knowledge of the  drafting process, since he is actively participating on the drafting committee,  and assist in identifying outstanding interconnection issues.

We encourage all to participate on the call and prepare to  express any questions, comments or concerns.

Attached is the agenda for the conference call.   Please reply back to this e-mail if you plan to participate on the  call. If you have questions or need additional information, please do  not hesitate to contact Chuck Linderman (x5652) or myself (x5098).
