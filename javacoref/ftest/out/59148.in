John,

The more I look at these comparisons, the more I'm convinced we have to
agree an interim subsidy to let folks down gently and/or a salary
adjustment. I think we will lose a very high number of people from this
transaction if we don't make some accommodation here.

I'll call you later today to discuss.

I also need to touch base with you on your salary comment. I need to clarify
what you mean by salary freeze. I understood you were ok with us promoting a
few people (50 or so) in next 4/6 weeks (so long as we run list passed you
first) and in this regard I would expect to adjust their salaries. We have
traditionally raised commercial support salaries (below VP) in line with
COLA (based on performance but typically around 3-4.5% of payroll) each
January and there certainly will be some expectations we will have to deal
with.

Regards

David
