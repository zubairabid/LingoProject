Janel:

Sorry my response is after the deadline, but I did have a couple of additional thoughts.

1.    Dan Allegretti sent you a note on Friday regarding the history of NEPOOL and the benefits created by regionalization.  In a pleading we filed early this year, we argued that going from three to one RTOs in the northeast (combining NY, NE, and PJM) will result in a significant savings in administrative costs.  We estimated you could cut down the current budgets for the three ISOs combined ($300 M per year) to much less than that, simply by eliminating a lot of the redundancies currently in place.  We did not substantiate this -- it just seemed to make sense.  You may want to ask the Tabors or Frontier people to see if they could come up with some rough numbers of administrative cost savings as  another benefit of forming large RTOs.

2.    In Sue's email, she asks for a list of some of the benefits of creating big RTOs.  Here are a few:

-    reduce barriers to the free flow of energy
-    development of free, open liquid markets which will ultimately result in lower prices
-    properly structured RTOs will get munis and coops into the transmission grid for operational purposes
-    eliminates the native load exception
-    removes operational control and (therefore commercial advantages) enjoyed by transmission owners who also operate their systems
-    standardize interconnection procedures
-    only 4-5 RTOs in the US means a lot fewer seams to deal with and better reliability (Charles Yeung may be able to help with this point)

You should also remind the consultants that FERC came up with a lot of good reasons for RTOs in Order No. 2000.

3.    Sue also asks what are the objections to RTOs.  See Susan Scott's summaries of the Requests for Rehearing filed in the Northeast and Southeast RTO proceedings.  People argue:

-    FERC has no legal authority to order RTOs
-    FERC did not go through the appropriate notice and comment period to make RTOs mandatory
-    regions will lose power due to exports (New England and Southeast concern), resulting in reliability concerns and higher prices
-    no justification for mandatory requirement and threatens reliability (again, Charles may be able to help you with this).

Responding to the objections is going to be more difficult.  On the legal question of whether FERC can mandate RTOs, Order 2000 may have some information but because they did not mandate RTOs in 2000, it may not address this issue in a lot of detail.  I'm not sure.  You may also want to check recent speeches/comments by Pat Wood -- I thought I read some statements he's made recently (perhaps in response to legislative issues) regarding FERC's actions in the RTO orders.
