I spoke with LeDain in Calgary.  They had a bid for C$3MM w/out the ABB turbines.  They are not planning to pursue because Lavorato commented that it is better to hold onto the site at that price.  The site is permitted for the ABB's.  I have asked LeDain to send me their original info memo for the sale of the site (w/ turbines); it might be worth trying to market that project again - time has passed, the market there may open soon, Ontario just set a new peak and East prices rallied last week.
