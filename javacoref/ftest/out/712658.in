Another victory at FERC!

Although Enron did not file a protest in this docket, nor was a signatory to
the joint Coral/Dynegy protest, I worked with Dynegy on forming the arguments
against the proposed change to OASIS (first to confirm after scheduling
deadline) at NERC.   Dynegy and Enron and a few others voted against the NERC
request but lost the vote thus leading to the NERC filing.  In my opinion,
such a practice would advantage incumbent utilities and their affiliate
marketers who tend to buy pre-confirmed Firm service.

One of the main arguments I made at NERC and a chief reason why FERC denied
the request is cited in the order:

"Dynegy/Coral argues that the proposed standard addresses the problem of
unused transmission capacity caused by some customers not confirming accepted
transmission requests, but does not address the underlying problem caused by
the practice of some transmission providers of delaying their acceptance of
requests for daily, firm transmission service, even when customers submit
their requests early. "

FERC further acknowleded:
"If transmission providers would all respond to requests for daily,firm
transmission service on a timely basis, then customers would have adequate
time to confirm before reservations are scheduled, and the MIC's proposed
business practice might not be needed."

This is the correct message for FERC to send back to NERC - to put the burden
on the transmission providers to expedite requests - not penalize the
customers for getting OASIS requests in early.
