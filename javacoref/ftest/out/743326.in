Attached are some notes about the Translink filing.  Kerry and I  were on a call with the Midwest Coalition.  Because Enron had filed a protest in the DTE/ITC case, we were asked to take a look at it.  This is very preliminary and we need to review the multi-volume filing further.  Comments are due October 29.  I propose that we file comments in this case similar to the position we took in the DTE case.
Mike and Kerry,
Perhaps we can divide up the multi-volumes and you can let me know if I have the gist of an Enron position in the outline.  Mike, can you take a look at the CMS since it is unclear if they are proposing the ability to retain their own or if they will commit to joining MISO on Day 2.
