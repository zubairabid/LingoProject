I want to thank all of you for participation in ENA's Off-Cycle Super
Saturday on June 3, 2000.  It was very successful and we made 28 offers.  As
of Friday, June 23, 25 Analysts and Associates had accepted our offers.
Without your support and help this could not have been accomplished.  I have
attached a list of candidates with their phone numbers and e-mail addresses
should you like to congratulate them.  Thanks again.  Ted
