Question:  re: "cat herding."  Do we have the participants list yet?  I've
got a call in to Smutney (IEP)---Sue talked to him about the cap yesterday
and I'm piling on today.  If we can give Smutney an alternative to "the $150
cap's OK," then we can likely persuade him.  Tim: Be useful to know as soon
as possible if the alternative Steve suggests below (i.e., >$150 bids with no
disclosure) is palatable.  If other specific CA generators are participating
on the panel, we'll need to know who they are in order to "assist" them with
their price cap-related comments.

Best,
Jeff
