We have received a notice dated 7/10/00 from Merrill Lynch International Bank
that it intends to transfer their FX business to Merrill Lynch International
Bank Ltd., a United Kingdom incorporated bank regulated by the SFA,
effective as of the fourth quarter of 2000.  We do have an ISDA Master
Agreement in place with Merrill Lynch International Bank.
I am sending a copy of the notice to Gary Hickerson & Tanya Rohauer (I am
also sending Tanya the financials of the new entity).  We will await Credit's
instructions as to how they would like to proceed after reviewing the
documentation.
