Susan-
Attached is the revised credit worksheet for TGS removing the CSA.  Given
that we will probably not have the ISDA executed by the time Argentina
transacts with TGS (by the end of the month), we will need to confirm the
deal including a Deemed ISDA per Sara's suggestions.
I advised Argentina that we were making no other changes to our format other
than removing the CSA since this seems to be the major issue for TGS.
However, we may want to hold off on sending the 2nd draft until commercial
has a chance to advise TGS of our position.  I want to make sure that the CSA
is really the only hurdle for them before we send the revised draft down.  I
will advise when I have heard back from Argentina on their further
discussions with the counterparty regarding the ISDA.
Let's discuss if any questions.
Regards,
Pat
