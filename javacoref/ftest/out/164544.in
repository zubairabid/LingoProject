Here are IEP's comments on caps.  It's from a draft circulated last Friday,
but just spoke with Smutney, and he said that the comments did not change
substantively .  Very briefly, "IEP is generally opposed to caps, but if
FERC's going to go with a soft cap, 1) there's a lot of clarification needed,
2) it needs to include "upward ratchet," a la Heber and 3) it must be linked
with other reforms (i.e., forward contracting, siting, retail markets,
etc.)."  The comments do not explicitly address the level of the cap.  They
also call for a technical conference.
Anything to add, Sue?

B. Issues Concerning Implementation of the &Soft Cap.8
IEP has concerns about the implementation of the &soft cap8 proposal.  IEP
has not and does not support price caps because it impedes the operation of
the market and distorts price signals.  Such mechanisms should have no place
in competitive markets in the long-run.  The Staff Report notes that caps do
not work. Citation; Also MSC,   IEP is concerned, as are others, that the
soft cap proposal will fail to attract new investments in supply or foster
meaningful demand response.   It is particularly problematic in terms of
attracting new capacity that will operate as peaker units for a limited
number of hours when weather-induced demand cannot be met from less expensive
units or imports. Notwithstanding the apparent opinion of SMUD otherwise,
there are demands which materialize only for a fraction of a percentage of
the total hours of a year, and therefore some resources will only be
dispatched a short number of hours to meet that need.  These resources tend
to be fast ramping, less efficient units that are not designed or intended to
operate as &baseload8 facilities.  Hence the suggestion that they &just
operate more8 to recover their costs is misplaced.
The soft cap also appears to be especially problematic to power marketers who
make wholesale purchases for subsequent resale but who may not own the
underlying physical generation assets.  These entities have a major role in
the marketplace in terms of bringing demand and supply together and they seek
return on the risks they undertake.  These entities will perceive the &soft
cap8 as a &hard cap8 which will chill their participation in California,
particularly when regional supplies become tight and expensive.  This
unintended consequence must be avoided or the markets will be hobbled.
IEP echoes the concern articulated by the CAISO that the soft cap proposal
may divert or require additional ISO resources.    It will clearly compound
the settlement processes at the CAISO as transactions above the soft cap will
require additional tracking and segregation to allow for potential
&unwinding8 should the bids be disallowed.  It will also require some form of
new software to provide for potential calculation of the weighted averaged
prices suggested in the November Order, presumably in 10-minute increments,
to blend with the market clearing prices established in the various markets.
Moreover, if that averaged price associated with bids above the cap is
modified often, then CAISO will be required to &re-run8 settlements or
undertake subsequent settlement adjustments.  It is possible that these
efforts*which are suggested as temporary measures in the November Order*would
take away from CAISO,s efforts at developing solutions to longer-run problems
in terms of software modifications/development.  At first blush the details
regarding implementation of the soft cap proposal are not straightforward as
currently described, and any further exploration this approach will at least
require a &technical conference8 to clarify the mechanics and to ensure that
it can be done in a reasonable manner.
IEP could only support the soft cap proposal if it is part of a negotiated
package of inter-jurisdictional programs, and provided that it is subject to
an pre-established unidirectional escalation mechanism, or a similar one-way
mechanism that is tied to the development of new capacity within the WSCC.
The inter-jurisdictional elements must include:
establishment of standards applicable to potential refunds based on
allegations of market power abuse in FERC jurisdictional markets;
definition of durable reasonableness review standards applicable to
wholesale purchases by the load serving utilities such that they will no
longer be discouraged from entering bilateral arrangements on a forward basis;
establishment of a &road map8 by the California Commission that delineates
a firm timeline*with milestones*for the review and resolution of retail
market issues including market-based demand responsiveness;
establishment of a &road map8 by this Commission, in consultation with the
CAISO, that delineates a firm timeline*with milestones*for the review and
resolution of implementation issues associated with the Commission,s
subsequent order in this docket as well as other outstanding proposals such
as generation interconnection rules and congestion management;
establishment of firm sunset date, not to exceed 2003, to bound the
duration of soft cap, and implement a unidirectional escalation mechanism,
not subject to subsequent lowering, which is based either on a
pre-established schedule or tied to increases in installed capacity within
the WSCC.
