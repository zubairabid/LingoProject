Its my turn, sorry I havent jumped in til now, computer problems.
At a EPSA sponsored meeting on Aug 9, the GISB Chair and Rae McQuade sat down and we went through what it takes to get EISB rolling and how they would tackle the tough issues at NERC.
I beleive the EPSA folks in the room, Mirant, Dynegy, Ontario Power Gen, Enron, Exelon, Calpine  and ELCON all felt that there shouls be one organization setting standards because of the inherent risks of assuming reliability and commercial issues can be sleanly separated.  We came away from the meeting with a comfort level that the GISB process will provide the right mechanism to resolve this age old debate - I don't care what kind of standard you call it - if you write it - it must be put through the GISB/EISB wringer.  GISB recommended that perhaps what we know as NERC today could be given a segment in the energy quadrant.
Also to respond to Sarah's note about support for an SRO - no entity in the room supported that FERC give deference to ANY standards organization - not NERC, NAERO, GISB or RTOs.  So I think we need to hold tight to this issue and we will be able to rally support for it.
I will speak at the GISB conference next Wed, Aug 15 at DOE.  I am working with Mark Bennett and other EPSA folks on key principles of what EPSA wants from the EISB Strawman.
I have attached notes I put together that will evolve into the statements I will make on behalf of EPSA.
Please proviede me your thoughts.
Also - I agree with Dick, today, NERC is 12.5 million dollars annually, and mostly utility dollars.  If we are going to push for a EISB, we have to provide some carrot for these utilities to agree to let EISB do this.  NERC (and their supporters) will fall on their sword on funding and the reult will be we have 2 organizations setting standards if NERC cannot agree to become a part of the EISB process.
And one more thing, I don't know how much commitment Jeff Skilling feels he has to the Independent Baord members, many of which he helped get seated.  But pushing for EISB and perhaps wrapping NERC into it as the reliability piece (GISB's suggestion) - may render the Independents obsolete.  I don't know if are wedded to them.
