Thank you for meeting with the students from Rice University's Jesse H. Jones Graduate School of Management in April.  The students greatly appreciated the opportunity to talk with you.  Your perspective and insights into EOL and its competitors helped the students gain much more useful information in their interviews with eNymex, HoustonStreet.com, ICE, DynegyDirect, and other energy e-commerce platforms.

The students will present the results of their research next Monday (May 7) at 4:00 p.m. in room 49C1.  We would be delighted if you can attend their presentation.  If you cannot attend but would like a copy of their final report, please feel free to let me know and I will make sure you get it.

Thanks again for your help.
