40 percent of Texans Plan to Try Electricity Competition: When the gates to deregulation open on January 1, 2002, the race to choose a new energy supplier will begin in the Texas market. According to a recent Scripps Howard Texas poll, there will be plenty of consumers ready to make the switch. The poll predicts that 40 percent of Texans are likely to switch their electric providers when the state markets open to competition. Results also showed that a majority of Texans agree that there should be more competition in the states electric power industry.

Texas Deregulation Gets More Kudos: Texas' deregulation plan is receiving praise yet again as a successful approach to deregulation. The Retail Energy Deregulation Index (RED Index), a scorecard developed by the Center for the Advancement of Energy Markets (CAEM), lists Texas' deregulation plan as second only to Pennsylvania's deregulation approach. According to Ken Malloy, CEO of CAEM, Texas is primed for a successful transition to a competitive electric retail market. CAEM, an independent, non-profit, Washington, DC based, think-tank specializing in energy competition policies produces the Retail Energy Deregulation Index (RED Index).

Electric Choice Stalled in California: California's ongoing struggle to get above their problems with deregulation has finally came to a head. On September 20, the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) suspended direct access until the Department of Water Resources no longer supplies power to the customers in California. The PUC's decision to take away direct access was deemed necessary to help the state pay for the upcoming 12.5 billion bond issue planned for later this year and to help pay off the states outstanding debt for energy purchased by the Department of Water Resources.

Although consumers can no longer change electricity providers, companies who already hold energy agreements will continue to receive service through the end of their contracts. EES is continuing to move forward in the California market with sales of natural gas procurement and delivery and many other services that are still needed in the region. With California consumers temporarily unable to seek the best price for power, services such as business risk management, distributed generation, and energy efficiency improvement services will become customers only outlet for achieving energy savings.
