PG&E Sues to Recover $3 Billion

Exploring yet another legal avenue, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. Wednesday
filed in San Francisco's federal district court asking for a judicial ruling
that will mandate that it can recover all of the nearly $3 billion in
uncollected wholesale electricity costs that have been mounting since May
when price spikes in Califonia's market left the state's major investor-owned
utilities vulnerable because their retail power rates are frozen at 1996
levels.

The utility argued that the wholesale power costs are federally approved,
therefore, it filed in federal court. Earlier in the fall, PG&E appealed to
the California Supreme Court, asking to overturn a California Public
Utilities Commission decision this summer that limits its ability to recover
its wholesale costs, which it passes on to customers without adding a profit
charge.

"We're just keeping our legal options open," said a San Francsco-based
utility spokesperson, noting that the utility also is attempting to protect
its financial status, which was challenged Tuesday when Fitch placed it and
another California utility on a "rating negative watch."

State and federal officials all acknowledge as part of a series of ongoing
investigations that California's current wholesale electricity market is
broken and noncompetitive in its current state, said Roger Peters, senior
vice president and general counsel for Pacific Gas and Electric. "However,
there has not yet been any concrete action by regulators to provide for
recovery of the costs we have incurred to purchase the power our customers
must have, either through refunds from power sellers who charged unfair
prices, or through retail rates. These costs are continuing to grow."

Noting both the unfairness and unpopularity of the skyrocketing wholesale
charges, PG&E's utility nevertheless said it has a legal right to recover the
charges from its almost four million customers, and it reiterated five steps
it has taken to "increase supply, moderate customer demand, repair the broken
wholesale market and provide stable, reasonable rates."
