Hi All, We have new real-time, HTLM based EOL plasma models. Simple XML/XSLT based configuration (see attached). Following model is presently used by the West Desk, the spread is marked against Hhub.

NB Where there point missing on the EOL models denotes a deactivated product. Tokenised products are cycled based on their activity status, i.e. cash products generally cycle around to EOL ids, these are switched at around 11.00am each trade day.

The EOL models can be easily configured for any EOL product. Let me know if your interested.
