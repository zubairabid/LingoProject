Cal-ISO seeks forward contracting authority

The California Independent System Operator (Cal-ISO) "most reluctantly" asked
FERC last week to approve tariff amendments that would allow the system
operator to obtain forward contracts.
Further, in an effort to discourage utilities from leaning on the ISO for
power, The ISO wants to allocate the costs of those contracts to scheduling
coordinators whose forward schedules do not reflect their actual real-time
demands. The allocation of those costs would be proportional to the sizes of
the deviations. This would be a change from the current system, in which
energy purchasing to balance load is spread among all market participants.
"Fairness, as well as providing appropriate economic incentives to scheduling
coordinators to align their forward and real-time schedules, dictates this
allocation," the Cal-ISO's filing states.
Recently, Cal-ISO President and CEO Terry Winter had unsuccessfully sought
approval from the ISO Board of Governors to approve an amendment to the ISO's
tariff to require scheduling coordinators to include at least 90% of actual
loads, with generation and imports sufficient to balance their schedules, in
final day-ahead schedules, and 95% of actual load in final hour-ahead
schedules. Scheduling coordinators would have had to bear the costs of the
ISO's out-of-market power purchases to balance the load. Coordinators would
have been allocated the costs of those arrangements in proportion to the
deviations of their actual real-time loads from their scheduled loads (GW
8/30).
The ISO is asking for authority to enter into forward contracts without first
soliciting bids because a formal bid process would take too long in a
fast-moving market.
FERC has directed the ISO to enter into forward contracts as a means of
better assuring that load requirements are met. FERC expressed its concern in
an order refusing San Diego Gas & Electric's request for a cap of indefinite
duration on energy sold in the California Power Exchange. FERC ordered "the
ISO to immediately institute a more forward approach to procuring the
resources necessary to reliably operate the grid."
The ISO said it is in total agreement with FERC's observation that a
reasonable supply portfolio would make use of forward contracting as a hedge
against price volatility. The ISO noted that the grid operator and FERC are
in agreement that fulfillment of forward contracting is a responsibility that
best resides with load-serving utilities.
"Unfortunately, and for reasons not at all apparent to the ISO, the utilities
thus far have been denied that authority," the Cal-ISO filing stated, noting
the decision to empower the utilities rests California Public Utilities
Commission. The ISO said it is applying for the tools to enter into forward
contracts, but expressed hope that load-serving entities would "receive and
exercise the authority to discharge a responsibility that more properly is
theirs."
The ISO said it doesn't want to be placed in the position as a competing
market player.
"The ISO continues to believe that its market activities should be
constrained to an absolute minimum and that, most particularly, it should not
be competing against load-serving entities for the energy needed to satisfy
load that is reasonably predictable," the Cal-ISO said.
The Cal-ISO wants forward contracting authority because the grid operator
needs to buy increasing amounts of power at the last minute to balance supply
and load on the grid. The ISO has been scrambling through real-time and
ancillary services markets to find this balancing power.
Originally, the California market system was set up so that utilities would
buy most of the state's power needs through the California Power Exchange's
(Cal-PX) day-ahead market. State regulators have not given utilities
authority to do extensive forward contracting outside the Cal-PX, and
utilities have been increasingly inclined to under schedule their actual
needs in the Cal-PX and lean on the ISO to provide the balance of the power
for their customers.
Saying that underscheduling of load continues to be a problem and cautioning
that unseasonably warm days occur in the fall, the ISO asked FERC to waive
the typical 60-day notice required for tariff amendments and allow the
changes to take effect immediately.
"What the ISO seeks are the tools necessary to enable it to contract if
available forward commitments appear reasonable," the system operator's
filing says. The ISO said it does not believe other, related FERC orders
require it to forward contract.
