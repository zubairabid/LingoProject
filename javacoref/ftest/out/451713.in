Dear all,

I'm deeply grateful to you all for your generous help and contribution to our
project of having Japan's Nikkei Business magazine carry a "Enron
Cover-Story" in its April 9th edition.

I received the magazine's April-9 issue today, and confirmed Enron was
carried as a real cover-story with 16 pages in it. It uses 8 pages to cover
Enron and Enron Japan, and uses another 8 pages to discuss other
electricity-deregulation related topics in Japan. The deregulation-related
parts also include stories which are very much supportive to Enron Japan's
messages - such as Japan's electricity prices are 2-3 times higher than the
international average.

The headline of "Enron Arrives" with Enron Logo is on the magazine's front
page, and photos of Enron building and others that we provided are nicely
used in the article.

The article itself is more or less balanced one which is good enough to
introduce Enron to the Japanese audience, though the reporter uses ironic
expressions here and there. The article also includes a column on California
crisis with the jump headline of "the cause of the California problem is not
deregulation, but is miserable design of regulation."

Thanks to your contribution, I believe this project proved a great success,
and the article will successfully raise Enron's visibility in Japan, while
our commercial staff will be able to show this high-profile magazine to their
potential customers and business partners.

Thank you so much again for your time and help, and I will send you full
translations of the article early next week.

I hereby attached some of scanned photocopies of the article.

warm regards,
Mika
