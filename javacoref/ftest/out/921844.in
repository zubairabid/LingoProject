Thank you for keeping us in the loop on this.  D&B data will become one of
our most important sources.  As you suggest, the intent is to use this data
along with other available date to generate a price for credit.  The price
will be published externally (likely for a fee and as a free service) via the
web or via automated processes.
Option 3 appears to be the best solution for us given our desire for as up to
date data as possible.  Stuart is working with the credit team to define
additional data elements but the credit score and financial score are likely
what we are looking for.  Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain the
actual data that is used to generate the score that would allow us to
generate our own score in addition to D&B's.  We will need the Global Failure
Score as well.  Currently we are active in Europe as well as the US and
expect to move towards Asia and Austrailia over time.  Hopefully, this data
is available via D&B Connect.
Another consideration is the term of contract.  We would likely prefer a
longer term contract so that if they decide they don't like what we are doing
with the data, we cannot be cut off.  Does it make sense from your
perspective to approach D&B to be our long term, strategic providor of
customer data.  This would likely make their deal maker look good in his
boss's eyes, give you lot's of negotiating ability and give a us the long
term preferential contract that we are looking for.
Let's discuss further.
