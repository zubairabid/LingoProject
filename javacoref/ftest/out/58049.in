Below is the final report I plan to run on our progress in monitoring and tracking completed mid-year written evaluation forms across the North American employee base (who were a part of the PRC process). The results remain disappointing and I would again ask for your assistance in encouraging your direct reports to complete and send a copy of the final evaluation forms to their HR reps. Please note the below illustrates forms registered back on employees personnel files and also that the support employees are shown under their related BU headings:
