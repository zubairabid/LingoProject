Dear Haas Community,

Sunday, May 20th, 2001, between 8:30 AM and 10:00 AM, several servers will
be shut down in preparation for Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS)
maintenance.  The  research computing server "bull", the research computing
server "grady", the database server SQL1, and several other servers  will
be shifted to an alternate power source so that their UPS batteries can be
replaced.  The actual down time will be about 30- 45 minutes for each server.

Monday the UPS manufacturers rep will replace the UPS batteries.

Tuesday, May 22nd, 2001, between 7:30 AM and 9:00 AM, the same servers will
again be shut down briefly as they are shifted back to their normal UPS
power sources.

While the servers are down research computing will not be available, login
to the Haas domain may be slow, and the administrative data bases will not
be available.

Email service should not be affected.

Should you experience any problems with computing services following the
maintenance, please restart your computer.  If the problem persists,
contact the information desk in the Computer Center, or helpdesk at
http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone 510/642-0434.  Please note that
Helpdesk is not manned on weekends.  Requests for help logged during the
weekend will be responded to Monday morning.

Your patience is greatly appreciated.

Thank you.
