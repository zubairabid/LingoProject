I talked to Terry Bilke at the MISO today about the training sessions and they have room in the classes on the 30th and 31st. He informed me that they would have more classes coming in the future. They have requested each company to limit the number of people they send to two for each session. I would like to suggest we send two people this time and in future sessions (fall) we could send another group. That is if anyone can spare people this time of the year.
I ask Terry when the MISO will be operational and his reply was FERC order 2000 stated that RTO'S will be running by Dec.15, 2001 and that date is their target. One of the MISO's biggest problems seems to be staffing. In an agreement with the MAIN  region they must leave 30% of the jobs open to MAIN employees but no one wants to move. The two parties have been negotiating that agreement but I don't know if anything has come out of the talks.
Thanks,
Keith
