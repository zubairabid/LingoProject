I am really not comfortable with Peter's idea.  This means that a Debtor In
Possession or a "rouge" PGE can permanently recall everything.  Is there
anyone else that we can talk to at El Paso?  They are always letting people
act as their agent for one thing or another.  Surely this can be fit into
that mold.  I'll call you in a bit Gerald.
