Greg Malcolm, the Contract Administrator for OPG just called to give me the
status of the following documents that were sent to them by Enron last fall:
1. EEI (physical power): Said I could expect to receive their comments to our
initial draft no later than the end of Feb.
2. ISDA (financial): I should receive a response from them on our initial
draft sometime in March (he was not as firm on this timeframe as he was about
the EEI).
3. Physical Power Confirms:  For interim trading, he is going to send me the
form of confirmation template they want to use for sales to us.
Commercial People: If these timeframes are unacceptable given whatever
business you are trying to do with OPG - please ask your equivalent at OPG to
put pressure on OPG's Legal Dept. There is nothing I can do to make this go
any faster.
Thanks,
