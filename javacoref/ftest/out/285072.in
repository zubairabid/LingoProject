We cannot attend now, since our babysitter has experienced an embryonic
growth on her left stirrup (you know, that cute little bone in your
inner-ear).  Anyway, since the Knipes can't go, Corriers don't have a
baby-sitter, and there was confusion over the locale, I think we should
scrap tonight's plans.  I guess the Parks and the Wollams can still go
listen to Irish fighting music while translating non-sensicle fruit bat
mutterings at their leisure.
