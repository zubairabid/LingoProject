Louise,
Thanks so much for your speedy reply. I will pass your comments on to Dave Walker in Media Relations.
I included Kevin because he is listed with you, Greg and John on a "management" slide. If there are others who should be
included on Greg's core management team for the announcement, please let me know who they are and their titles. Please
also let me know if it is inappropriate to include Kevin. If there is an org chart, that might be helpful, too. It would
allow us to be as inclusive as possible without making the announcement too long.
Thanks again,
