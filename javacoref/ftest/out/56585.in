I would like to make the message even more clear.  EPMI will not be making any changes, amendments, clarifications, interpretations, etc. to the current Indian Mesa II PPA.   Therefore, any proposed purchaser of the Indian Mesa facility must evaluate the contract based on their own legal and commercial interpretation.

I don't think it is productive to spend any more time on this discussion.   We will continue provide Enron Wind with the PPA value on a daily basis such that total shareholder value is maximized for any proposed wind transaction (sale of company and/or sale of IM project).

Please feel free to call me to discuss (713-853-5035)
