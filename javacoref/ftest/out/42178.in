Here is the rest of the information to fill in the below blanks:
a)  Gas prices at TCO's pool for spot gas trades for April 22, 2002 were $3.545 per Dth ---  the midpoint of Gas Daily's Columbia Appalachia price posting.
b)  ENA did receive various letters from TCO addressing Section 9.5(c) notifications.  The first notice was dated November 28, 2002.  The other two letters memorialized conversations regarding ENA's creditworthiness.  I can fax these to you.
c)  EES appears to not have received letters regarding creditworthiness, or at least I can not find any correspondence.  Apparently, phone conversations did occur that related to the fact that if EES pays their bills that TCO would continue to allow them to do business.  EES has paid their post-petition invoices, with one exception, a billing dispute of $1000 to $1500 that was related to nominating on a contract that had been recalled by the releasing shipper without notice to EES.
d)  Due to the uncertainty of whether TCO was going to allow EES to use the capacity,  EES did not use their capacity in December.  EES did pay the invoice, however, as is noted on Exhibit H.
e)  For providing adequate assurances of performance,  EES did not have to put up anything special, like a guaranty or a letter of credit.  TCO has been requiring that EES maintain a minimum volume balance on EES's OBA, Operational Balancing Agreement, for their pool.  TCO has indicated that 71,766 Dth should be the minimum OBA balance for April 2002.  EES's OBA balance as of April 21, 2002 is 36,647 Dth.  Based on current forecasts, EES's ending OBA balance will be 46,876 Dth, so EES will have to go out and purchase additional supplies to maintain TCO's April 2002 minimum balance of  71,766 Dth.  This is the only thing that is happening that can be deemed a "frozen parking balance".
f)  We can not find the misplaced invoice that would nail down how much gas may be due ENA in Item #8.  Just go with at least 62,000 Dth.
g)  EES has not really been harmed in that they have been prevented in making sales.  Maintaining the minimum OBA balance has just increased their operating costs.
h)  On Ed's affidavit, the above changes need to be made.  Also please decide whether, the letters that I am faxing you really over-ride many of the notification arguments that you are trying to make.
