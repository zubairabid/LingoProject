These are the questions and concerns provided by Connie and Trish.
To Dos:
*	For consistency, Dave Odle will you please address the first
four items and provide the functionality difference for Version 1.3 and
1.4 as requested.  Please send this information ASAP to all three
listserves.
*	Upon receipt of the above information, each company should
address from their perspective, the questions posed in the second
paragraph.
*	Each company (TDSP, CR, ERCOT) should then address from your
companies' perspective each of the questions regarding the various
Options.
*	Shirley Whyte - as ITPTA would you please provide to all three
listserves ASAP an explanation of what funcitonality is tested in Frame
6, so that companies may specially answer question #7.
*	Please evaluate the various options provided in the previous
email and document from your companies perspective:  known or peceived
risks, any ideas on how to mitigate these risks, what contingency plans
do we need in place, etc.
I wanted to get these items to you as soon as possible so you may begin
to evaluate,etc.  Since we have extremely tight timeframe for companies
to gather this information and rather than forward all of this
information to me to somehow combine.  By noon, Tuesday, October 30th,
please provide from your companies perspective (TDSP, CR, and ERCOT) for
each option:  pros, risks associated with each option, any ways to
mitigate these risks, impacts to the market/customers, and what would be
the contingency plan.  Discussion around these items will also help us
to answer the other questions posed, but please come to the meeting
prepared with your companies response to all of the questions.
I realize that this may not make sense on Monday morning (since it is
1:15 Saturday morning), so please feel free to let me know if you have
any questions, etc.  Thanks.
