Louise,
I have completed a review our current requirements for services from EEOS as well as those for 2002. At present, we are using Bill Fox to support the coal initiative. In addition, we are using Ed Danhaus for City of Austin warranty work. All work by EEOS to support the site acquisition and development initiatives including Ft Pierce have been terminated or are being terminated. Matt Tezyk has just completed an inventory of the Westinghouse equipment (D5A) that we own that is currently in dispute. While we are not currently using EEOS for Vitro, Tractebel has a call on named EEOS personnel at the project budget through November of 02. We have an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to subsititute others if these individuals are not available. All these requirements as well as any others can be met from Virgo's group in 2002. Therefore, we have no requirements from EEOS in 2002.
Neither West Power nor Canada are currently using EEOS. The Longview project is in the pre-NTP phase.  A buyer could elect to use EEOS as the turnkey contractor but would not be obligated to use them nor would we be obligated to offer EEOS services in the sale. They do not anticipate using EEOS in 2002. Likewise, Canada will not use them in 2002.
Enron SA is currently using 1-2 engineers from EEOS on a full time basis. This requirement could increase (slightly) in 2002 if they phase out their inernal group. However they would also be comfortable using third party vendors in SA. Thus, they do not require EEOS.
