Kevin,
I am still working with the Arizona Chapter of TNC to get the information I was looking for.  However, preliminary talks is that there are no show-stoppers from the environmental community at this point.  There will be some sensitive issues, but we can work through them.  On a project of this magnitude (400 miles, with about 200 of it greenfield) an environmental strategy should be developed which would probably include some early scoping meetings to assess public and landowner input.  I would suggest that you consider having a Third Party do the EIS for the FERC Staff (it is much faster that way as the FERC does not have to dedicate staff to a major filing).  Also, have you thought about whether or not we would want to go to the FERC early and solicit their involvement up-front to expedite and streamline the processing?  I am assuming that Rob Kilmer will be in charge of putting the application together since he has assumed the TW work from Mark Kay Miller (at least that is what I have been told)?  I would also suggest that you think about enlisting the input from the Public Relations folks (i.e., Gina Taylor).
