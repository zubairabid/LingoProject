A wild week in Iowa.  By the end of the day Tuesday, it became clear to all
parties that the bill would not be called for a vote.  The customers were
unwilling to give anymore on the enviroment issues and the democrats would
similarly not back off their positions.  Mid American then switched gears to
pull out all the stops on getting labor support in order to trump the enviro
supporters.  Mid American put forward a proposal to the unions/legislators
that they would commit to build 2 power plants in the state of Iowa (as
opposed to developing in Illinois) over the next 5 years that would employ
union labor. Mid American also had it's top management making many visits
this week---Greg Abel and I believe also David Sokol.  (No Warren Buffet
sightings yet!!!!)This offer created a flurry of activity on both sides, but
at the end of the day Thursday, the state IBEW group let it be known that
they would still not support the bill even with the Mid Am proposal.
Mid American believes that the Republicans now have a hook to force the
democrats into voting for the de reg bill, by saying that if they don't vote
affirmative, they are not for economic development in the rural/struggling
areas of the state where the power plants would be built.
WHile I may not share Mid American's positive assessment, the proponent's
group continues it's advocacy and will meet with legilsators in their
districts over the weekend. The senate leadership agreed to hold off
reconvening the committee until Monday afternoon in an effort to allow any
last minute maneuvering over the week end.
