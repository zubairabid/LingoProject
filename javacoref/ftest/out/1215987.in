Rate hike in the offing
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER
SAN FRANCISCO -- An energy crisis that has already brought widespread power
blackouts is now set to hit Californians' bank accounts with a large rate
increase that is headed for approval today.
State regulators are weighing a 30 percent hike on electricity rates that
would come on top of a smaller, temporary rate increase that was adopted in
January. The temporary increase also is expected to be made permanent today
by the Public Utilities Commission.
Still to be determined is the question of who will bear the brunt of the rate
increases, which are expected to appear on the May bills of California's 7.5
million utility customers.
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said the rate
increases are needed to replenish more than $4 billion in ongoing electricity
purchases by the state treasury and allow utilities to continue to buy
electricity from alternative energy companies.
The rate increase also satisfies conditions that are needed before the state
can borrow $10 billion or more to finance its power buys.
Lynch also said she will propose a tiered rate structure that would penalize
those who use the most electricity and leave nearly half the state's utility
customers, who use relatively little, untouched by the increase.
Seen as inevitable by many observers, the politically volatile issue of rate
hikes is nevertheless another admission that the state's foray into
electricity deregulation, which was supposed to lead to cheaper and more
plentiful electricity, has failed.
Consumer groups, calling the proposed rate hikes a $4.8 billion gift to
utilities, responded by saying they would hasten plans to take the state's
energy mess to voters through a ballot initiative. Among their proposals:
rolling back rates, forcing a state takeover of power plants or implementing
an excess profits tax on energy companies.
"The ratepayer revolt is under way," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "The voters are going to have to
take matters into their own hands at the ballot box. It will be a bloodbath."
Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis immediately distanced himself from the rate-hike
proposal.
"The governor believes tiered pricing could promote the conservation
California needs if structured properly but was not convinced of that by the
data made available to him last week," according to a statement from Davis'
office Monday. "He has asked for more information, which should be available
this week. The governor has not had conversations with any commissioners
about a potential rate hike. It is still his hope and expectation that this
matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure."
Some observers were incredulous, noting Davis' reputation as a micromanager
who keeps appointees on a short leash.
"The PUC has been run like his personal cabinet for a year and a half," said
Gary Ackerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo
Park-based association of electricity generators and traders. "This one's got
me floored. The governor once again is a day late. The Oscars for best actor
were last night."
Confronted with teetering utilities, alternative energy companies that were
refusing to sell power in the state and state coffers bleeding by about $50
million a day, Lynch unveiled a set of four interwoven decisions that the
commission is scheduled to vote on today.
The measures would:
Raise consumer rates by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and make permanent a 1
cent temporary hike implemented in January. Before the January rate hike,
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers paid a 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for
electricity, 5.4 cents of which was earmarked for the utility's energy buys.
If the hike is approved, those figures will rise to 13.4 cents per
kilowatt-hour on average, 9.4 cents of which will be used for electricity
purchases.
Determine how much of that money will be used to reimburse the state
treasury, which has committed more than $4 billion to electricity purchases
since mid-January. Lynch said Monday that although the state has not yet
submitted data on its power buys, she believes the proposed rate hike will
fully reimburse state coffers.
Order the utilities to pay alternative energy companies, some of which have
shut down operations because they are not getting paid. The order would apply
to buys already under contract but not to the $1.5 billion that the utilities
owe for electricity already used.
Launch a PUC investigation into whether the utilities have improperly
sheltered profits in their holding companies and subsidiaries.
The proposals focus on the state's power buys and the utilities' upcoming
power purchases and do nothing to address directly the mountain of debt that
the utilities have accumulated. PG&E and Southern California Edison owe banks
and energy companies billions.
"We're still going through the proposed decisions and would like to wait
until we have fully analyzed the material before we comment on it," said Ron
Low, a spokesman for PG&E.
By raising rates, state regulators would lessen the severity of blackouts
this summer but would probably not prevent them entirely, according to
industry groups.
"In any circumstance, we're going to have a very difficult summer," said Jan
Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. "It's
too early to say how sufficient it is, but it (the commission's willingness
to raise rates) is an important recognition of reality."
Lynch acknowledged the measures will only partly address electricity
problems.
She called on federal regulators to impose regionwide caps on the wholesale
electricity market and order more refunds when prices have been unreasonably
high.
If the commission adopts the rate hike today, its next step will be to
determine who pays what portion.

Power rate hike reaction mixed
Wall Street likes proposal, but local business leaders have some misgivings
BY RICK JURGENS
TIMES STAFF WRITER
The electricity rate hike proposed Monday by the state's top utility
regulator elicited cheers on Wall Street, where the prices of California
utility stocks rose about 30 percent, but got a more cautious reaction from
local business leaders.
"This is a regrettable necessity," said Justin Bradley, energy program
director for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, a San Jose-based group
of 190 technology employers.
A rate hike won't in itself solve the state's electricity crisis, said Bruce
Kern, executive director of the Economic Development Alliance for Business in
Oakland. Reliability is the key business concern about electricity, and
restoring reliability will require more generating capacity and conservation
assistance for companies, he said.
Despite a surge in wholesale electricity costs since April 2000, California
regulators have allowed only a 9 percent increase in retail prices and Gov.
Gray Davis has adamantly rejected calls for further rate hikes. But Public
Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, signaled
that the administration may be ready to retreat with a plan to hike the
average retail price by 3 cents a kilowatt hour. That would be a 46 percent
increase over the current average rate in the PG&E service area of 6.4 cents
a kilowatt hour, excluding distribution and other costs not directly related
to power procurement.
That didn't faze Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of
Commerce. "We have looked at it as inevitable for some time," he said of the
rate hike. Higher natural gas costs, along with the dry winter that reduced
the availability of hydroelectric power throughout the West, were bound to
boost retail bills, he said.
Bradley, speaking for tech manufacturers, said Lynch's plan promises to stem
the tide of state agency spending on electricity, direct some revenue toward
small generators and put some downward pressure on wholesale prices but is
only one step toward a long-term solution. "We need an overall philosophy and
strategy to restore normalcy to this market," he said.
Lynch, who described her offering as "merely a proposal to jumpstart the
public process of rate design," included as a "principle" plans to narrow the
gap between residential rates and those of industrial users, whose average
bill now logs in at about 3 cents a kilowatt hour less. Lynch suggested that
that differential be shaved by about a penny an hour.
That isn't the direction that Kern would like to see things move. "Our main
concern would be that if there is a rate increase it be (done) equitably and
not disproportionately affect business in this region," he said. "We're
beginning to hear employers say, 'Maybe it's just too costly to do business
here,'" he warned.
Higher electricity rates might force price increase and a cutback in
expansion plans at Helios Farms Nursery in Brentwood, which runs electric
water pumps for up to eight hours a day during the summer. "It's too soon to
tell the affect" of the rate increase, said Maria Orfanos, one of the owners.
"We'll have to see what happens this summer. We need to water the plants."
But rate hikes promise to remove the cloud of debt -- billions of dollars
worth -- that now hovers over the utilities. The gap between high wholesale
prices and fixed retail rates cost PG&E as much as $4.1 billion in after-tax
profits during 2000, the company said in a securities filing Monday. But that
didn't seem to bother investors, whose heavy buying made California utilities
among the stock market's big gainers Monday. PG&E's stock closed at $13.75,
up $3.10 or 29.1 percent, and Edison International, Southern California's
largest electricity seller, closed at $14.55, up $3.35 or 29.9 percent.
Edison issued a late-day response to Lynch's move that seemed designed to
dampen investors' enthusiasm. "A cursory review of the multiple complex
proposals suggests that substantial improvements will be needed if they are
to fully align costs with rates and restore the creditworthiness of the
state's utilities in the eyes of the financial community," it said. Edison
also called for the PUC to allow "flexibility to meet unknown future shifts
in the costs of generation."
A PG&E spokesman said the company was still analyzing the "inch-thick stack
of materials" and had no comment. An earlier PUC proposal to require the
utility to pay small generators would leave the utility with "insufficient
revenues ... to recover the cost of its own generation" and to pay other
contracted generators, it said in its filing.
Kern, the EDAB chief, said he was encouraged by the state's plan to issue
industrial revenue bonds to finance stand-by generators for businesses and to
install energy-efficient lighting.

State proposes electric rate hike: PUC suggests 30 percent average increase;
industry hit hardest
By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published March 27, 2001)
The wildfires sweeping California's electric market burned through to
consumers' wallets Monday, with a proposal that appeared virtually certain to
boost overall rates roughly 30 percent.
Some customers, including households that use little electricity, could be
spared entirely, while others, including some of the state's biggest
manufacturers, could see increases of close to 90 percent.
It would be the biggest rate increase in state history, and there is no
guarantee it would be enough to resolve California's electricity crisis,
state-funded ratepayer watchdogs said.
While Gov. Gray Davis sought to distance himself from the proposal, industry
observers said it stretched credulity to imagine his appointees to the state
Public Utilities Commission would have gone against his wishes.
"Anyone who wants to claim this isn't part of his plan is going to fly in the
face of everything he's told us. It's just not likely," said Camden Collins,
a Bay Area energy consultant who has held high-level posts with the PUC and
the state grid operator.
After a weekend marathon of last-minute calculations, the PUC issued a
wide-ranging, sometimes contradictory package of proposals Monday for
probable commission votes today.
In one of the biggest conflicts, a PUC administrative judge who oversaw rate
hearings urged no increase at all, while commission President Loretta Lynch,
who leads a Davis-picked PUC majority, urged a hike of 3 cents per
kilowatt-hour.
Other key proposals include:
Making permanent a temporary 9 percent - 1 cent per kilowatt-hour - rate hike
imposed in January for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison.
Starting immediate discussions on designing rates that would fall hardest on
the heaviest users, changes that could appear in May electric bills.
Revising the formula for paying alternative power producers, known as
"qualifying facilities," in a way that several said still wouldn't solve a
simmering payment dispute.
Creating a formula for utilities to pay the state for electricity purchases
made on their behalf since January, which appears to clear the way for the
state to issue power purchase bonds.
Reclassifying past debts and expenses to sharply cut utilities' estimates of
their losses - a move sought by consumer groups.
Consumer groups blasted the proposal, investors welcomed it, and utilities
were cautious, with PG&E declining immediate comment and Edison saying it
still didn't go far enough. Generators and economists labeled it a good first
step.
"We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is
needed," Lynch said. "It's time to pay the power bills for California."
Customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District would not be affected,
although it is considering its own 16 percent rate hike, also driven by
skyrocketing wholesale costs.
Lynch's proposal would let PG&E collect an extra $2.3 billion annually from
customers, increasing PG&E's system average rate from 10.4 to 13.4 cents a
kilowatt-hour. That comes on top of January's 1-cent average increase, for a
total rate hike this year of more than 40 percent.
But individual rates could play out very differently. Some people would
escape entirely, including those on special low-income rates and residential
customers whose electricity use falls below a state-set threshold. Companies
big enough to own their own substations could face hikes of 87 percent;
agricultural consumers, 10 percent to 24 percent; and other businesses, 41
percent to 58 percent.
"Electricity hogs will have to pay more," Lynch said.
For his part, Davis told reporters in Los Angeles, "As governor, I have not
decided there should be a rate increase, and as governor, I have not decided
that tiered pricing makes sense."
Although Davis has appointed three of the PUC's five commissioners, he said
"I can't order or direct an independent body."
Davis' top staff members, however, have been in close communication with the
commission. Industrial groups indicated the governor's staff was discussing
nearly identical rate hikes last week.
Michael Shames, head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action
Network, said, "This PUC doesn't do anything of this substance without the
governor's approval."
If they pass today, Lynch said, the new rate increases should be enough to
pay the qualifying facilities and the state for power that is produced or
purchased from now on. Still unresolved is whether additional rate hikes will
be needed to cover billions that utilities say they are owed for past
purchases.
Several executives of the qualifying facilities said the plan wouldn't pay
them enough.
"I don't think it works," said Dean Vanech, president of Delta Power Co.,
which runs five gas-fired cogeneration plants in California. Four have been
closed because of lack of payment. "We'd lose money marginally on every
kilowatt we produce," he said.
Still, many in the private sector saw Lynch's statement as a sign that
progress was being made.
Investors drove both utilities' shares up nearly 30 percent. Edison
International rose $3.35 to $14.55. PG&E Corp. was up $3.10 to $13.75.
Stephen Levy, senior economist with the Center for Continuing Study of the
California Economy, said he thinks the state can weather the rate increase.
"Last year California absorbed a 50 percent increase in the cost of gasoline
with no appreciable effect," Levy said.
Although California's economy will slow this year, it will be the result of
the national malaise and the troubles in the technology sector, not energy
costs, Levy said.
But the top increases will hit hard at businesses, including "cement, steel,
a lot of high tech, anybody in manufacturing," said Carolyn Kehrein, a
consultant to commercial power users. Some will flee the state, and many
others will either raise their own prices or cut back on salaries, she said.
In two hours of testimony before the PUC after the proposals were unveiled,
utility and consumer lawyers alternately praised and shredded them.
Noting utilities' last proposal was for a lower increase, Robert Finkelstein,
attorney for The Utility Reform Network, said, "You're surpassing their
wildest dreams. That's very, very disturbing."
The Lynch plan relies heavily on a state bond offering to finance a major
portion of the Department of Water Resources' electricity purchases. In doing
so, "we are borrowing against the future to pay the extremely high rates of
today," said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy
Institute in Berkeley. "We're just paying it on an installment plan instead
of paying all right now."
But he said massive, immediate rate hikes could shock California into a
recession. "We're doing a balancing act," he said.

Cox new minority leader in GOP coup: Assembly conservatives want to flex
energy muscle
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 27, 2001)
Assembly Republicans staged a two-hour coup Monday that ended with Sacramento
County's Dave Cox being named minority floor leader, a move sparked by
conservatives pushing for a more confrontational approach to the energy
crisis.
Cox, of Fair Oaks, vowed to be more "aggressive and proactive" on energy
issues. He declined to comment on reports that his predecessor, Bill Campbell
of Villa Park, was dumped in part because he was working too closely with
Democrats.
"We don't want to talk about individual personalities," Cox said when asked
why Campbell was replaced after less than five months in the leadership post.
"We don't want to sensationalize it. It's a family matter. We'll handle it in
the family."
Cox, 63, who is the sixth Assembly Republican leader since late 1995, has
significant experience in the energy field. He served for four years on the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District's governing board, and later spent six
years as a Sacramento County supervisor before joining the Assembly in 1998.
Under his leadership, Cox said, Republicans will articulate an energy crisis
"game plan" and specific measures to help generate adequate power supplies by
2004.
Although Republicans hold only 29 seats in the 80-member Assembly, Cox said
that does not mean the party has no control over legislation.
"You have as much power as you think you have," he said.
Privately, Assembly Republicans said Cox's selection was driven by a feeling
that they need to further distance themselves from Gov. Gray Davis' power
plans and by several key energy-related developments within the past week:
The Legislature is bracing to vote on separate bills that would provide
long-term contracts for alternative energy providers and would set the stage
for California to market billions in bonds to buy electricity in years to
come.
Both those votes require a two-thirds majority to take effect immediately,
meaning that at least five Republicans would have to join with Democrats in
supporting the measures. Republicans feel that situation gives them leverage,
and many want a tough leader negotiating on the party's behalf.
At a party caucus late last week, many Republicans were upset by the
Democrats' decision to place both key energy issues - and a third that would
extend an existing rate cap to large San Diego businesses - into a single
bill, AB 8x.
Assembly Republicans adamantly opposed that single-bill strategy but were
placed in an awkward political position - they could either swallow their
philosophical opposition or vote against the bill and take the blame if
blackouts resulted.
As Republicans debated the issue in tense party caucuses, Campbell commented
that he thought the Democrats' bill would pass. Opponents were livid. He
later said he did not support AB 8x and was simply providing "cover" for
colleagues who planned to vote "yes."
Republicans ultimately voted as a bloc against AB 8x and demanded that all
three issues be considered in separate bills. Assembly leaders negotiated
throughout the weekend, but the issues remain unresolved.
During last week's tense party caucuses, Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy,
R-Monrovia, reportedly criticized Campbell for leadership weaknesses.
Campbell lost his temper, adding momentum to a growing feeling of frustration
within the caucus, sources said.
Campbell said Monday that he doubts that the confrontation with Mountjoy
played a major role in his removal. "That was just a case where things
happened and I apologized to Dennis. He said, 'It didn't bother me, I have a
thick skin.' "
Asked if he had any regrets about his service as Republican leader, Campbell
said simply that he has enjoyed the post and did his best during the "wild
ride" of this year's energy crisis.
"I'd like to still be the leader - but I'm not," he said.
Republican sources said opposition to Campbell's leadership has been growing
since January, when he voted to support AB 1x, which committed the state to
enter the power-buying market in a big way and spend billions for long-term
energy contracts.
Campbell, after seeing that he lacked support Monday, decided to step down
rather than spark a divisive fight to retain the post. Sources said Cox held
about twice as much support within the caucus as Campbell.
Ultimately, support from Republican conservatives led by Tony Strickland,
R-Thousand Oaks, provided the margin of victory for Cox.
The vote marked a turnabout for Strickland's group, which sided with Campbell
when he was elected over Cox in November.
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said it's too soon to tell
whether Monday's vote will leave Assembly Republicans deeply divided.
"It could mean less unity, it could mean more," he said. "It really depends
on Dave Cox's ability to pull the caucus together."
GOP political consultant Wayne Johnson said he thinks term limits were a
factor in the caucus' impatience with Campbell.
"Everybody knows they're not here for very long, and when you're here during
what is becoming somewhat of a crisis environment, people want to be a little
more proactive," Johnson said.
Ray McNally, a Republican Party consultant, called Campbell an "energy
casualty."
Under Cox, he said, Assembly Republicans will be "more aggressive in
presenting alternatives," and Cox will "work harder to show the differences
in approaches to solving the energy problem."

Dan Walters: An absolutely incredible tale


(Published March 27, 2001)
From the onset of his governorship two-plus years ago, Gray Davis has
insisted, by both public words and private acts, that he and he alone would
make his administration's major policy decisions.
Legislators and lobbyists have complained that no one in Davis' office was
empowered to give an up or down signal on pending legislation, and
administration officials have recounted grimly - and very privately - tales
about Davis' insistence on deciding even minuscule policy matters. The
governor once castigated one of his Cabinet appointees before her colleagues
in the harshest possible language for making an environmental policy change
without his approval. The most routine action by a state agency is trumpeted
through the governor's media office. Davis has even joked about his
micromanagerial tendencies.
It is, therefore, utterly incredible - in the precise meaning of the word -
that Davis' handpicked president of the state Public Utilities Commission, a
former political adviser, would raise electric power rates by billions of
dollars without clearing it through Davis. Yet that's what the governor's
mouthpiece asserts.
On Monday, PUC President Loretta Lynch - acknowledging what anyone with half
a brain knew weeks ago - declared that power rates would have to jump
sharply. She is proposing an increase of three cents a kilowatt-hour, about
40 percent, in areas served by private utilities to cover the massive costs
associated with the current crisis, with a "tiered" structure to impose most
of the burden on high- volume power users.
Even Lynch was fudging, however, when she insisted that the boost - from
about seven cents a kilowatt-hour to 10 cents - would be "all that is needed
going forward." In fact, as anyone who can do simple arithmetic can
calculate, it's only the beginning of a series of rate jumps that will be
needed to cover past debts and current wholesale costs. It's not improbable
that ultimately, rates will double (not counting another nickel a
kilowatt-hour that's imposed for delivery and other costs).
Lynch's public statement came just three days after Davis' aides briefed key
legislators on the likelihood of sharp rate boosts. Throughout, however,
Davis' spokesmen have insisted that the governor was not supporting such
increases and continues to believe that the supply and price crunches can be
handled "within the existing rate structure," as one euphemistic version put
it.
The latest spin was issued by Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, after
Lynch's statement. "The governor has not had conversations with any (utility)
commissioners about a potential rate hike," the Maviglio statement said. "It
is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within the
existing rate structure."
Clearly, the governor, who has been so insistent on doing things his way - a
tendency bordering on obsessive-compulsive behavior - has gone into the
bunker on this one, allowing Lynch to take the heat from consumer groups,
which immediately denounced the proposed rate increase as a giveaway to the
utilities.
It's cowardly, especially because the current crisis is largely a product of
dithering by Davis and Lynch last summer when the first price-supply problems
appeared. Had they acted forthrightly then, with such steps as long-term
supply contracts, it would have been a relatively minor bump rather than a
full-blown disaster that threatens the state's business climate and its
solvency and will cause financial pain for Californians.
If California needs a utility rate increase, so be it. But we Californians
would appreciate not being treated like children who need sugarcoating for
the bad-tasting medicine. And we'd also appreciate not having our
intelligence insulted with fairy tales from the Governor's Office.

Daniel Weintraub: No crisis is big enough to slow Davis' fund spree


(Published March 27, 2001)
If Gov. Gray Davis' potential opponents wanted to invent an anecdote to use
against him when he runs for re-election next year, they couldn't do any
better than the one he handed them Friday.
While lawmakers desperately in need of leadership deadlocked on crucial
legislation to help solve California's energy crisis, Davis was at a Palm
Springs country club and golf course, raising money to add to his campaign
committee's already record-shattering $26 million bank balance.
The governor's spokesman assures us that Davis did not actually play golf
Friday. He merely stopped by the fund-raiser because he had some time to kill
between a morning groundbreaking ceremony and an afternoon television
interview.
Right. Davis may have been in Palm Springs on state business, but it's
curious that, wherever he goes, this governor always seems to find a way to
raise some money. Even if he didn't play golf, the incident drives home the
image of a governor so preoccupied with his own re-election that he can't
stay on-task in Sacramento to work on what is arguably the biggest crisis any
California politician has ever faced.
While Davis was rubbing shoulders with wealthy supporters in the desert, his
staff and some investment bankers were briefing lawmakers on just how bad the
energy crisis has become. The state may need to borrow $23 billion before
it's over, the bankers said, not the $10 billion that the governor has
publicly announced. And the idea of keeping the lights on without further
rate increases - a mantra to which Davis has clung against all reason - is a
fantasy. Rates will have to rise, perhaps double, to get us out of this,
according to the governor's staff. You cannot forever buy a dollar's worth of
power, they are saying, with 50 cents.
This is incredible stuff, especially coming from the governor's own people.
But what's even more astounding is that this news was delivered to the
Legislature, and thus the public, before Davis himself was fully briefed.
Davis is not only out of town, it turns out. He's out of touch. Of course, we
didn't need Friday's fund-raiser to figure that out.
Last week, to put it mildly, was a bad one for the governor, whom critics
have begun to call the prince of darkness. It began with two days of rolling
blackouts that would not have happened but for Davis' inattention to a
problem that threatened to shut down between 10 percent and 20 percent of the
state's already short power supply. Alternative energy producers, including
cogeneration plants that produce electricity as a byproduct of a
manufacturing operation, were going dark because they weren't getting paid
for their electricity and could no longer afford to buy the fuel that fires
their plants.
It has been widely known for months that the utilities weren't paying these
power producers. The Legislature has been working on a measure to get them
paid and lower their rates by roughly half. It's a very important part of any
comprehensive solution to the crisis. But after the blackouts hit, Davis
acted as if he'd only just discovered the problem. He was outraged. He said
it was "immoral" for the utilities to collect money from ratepayers and not
pay their suppliers.
But that was only the beginning. The battle over getting the small energy
producers paid led to questions about how the state would be paid for the
power purchases Davis has been making since January on behalf of the
utilities. Davis intends to float a bond measure - public borrowing - to
reimburse the state's general fund for the $4 billion-plus that the emergency
buys are costing taxpayers. The bond is supposed to be retired by dedicating
a share of future electricity rates to repayment. For the transaction to
work, the bond buyers insist on getting first call on the money collected by
the utilities.
The law Davis signed in January when he started buying the power was supposed
to put the state, and its bond partners, at the front of the line for the
utilities' cash. But the utilities, particularly Pacific Gas & Electric,
don't think the law does that. And Davis apparently failed to get their
signature on an IOU before he put taxpayers on the hook to save the companies
from bankruptcy.
These are rather large details to miss for a guy who has a reputation as a
control freak and a micromanager. But they are part of a pattern stretching
back to last summer, when Davis brushed off early warnings about the
potential depths of the crisis he was even then trying to avoid. More and
more he gives the impression of a man not so much trying to resolve the
energy crisis but of one who is thinking first, and foremost, about saving
his own political skin. The problem is, the more he focuses on his own
prospects, the worse they become.
It would be nice if Davis would suspend his political money-grubbing for a
few weeks and work full-time on the business he was elected to do. But then
again, maybe he should schedule even more fund-raisers: The way things are
going, come re-election time, he is going to need every penny he can get.

Energy woes give nuclear plants a life




Crisis offers second chance to all-but-discarded industry
By Bruce Lieberman
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
March 26, 2001
A group of nuclear power advocates and energy experts gathered in an
auditorium in Irvine last month to discuss "Nuclear Power: The Option for the
21st century?"
Their talk was upbeat.
Even asking that question would have been laughable five years ago.
In 1996, California was heading toward a deregulated electricity market. The
commercial nuclear power industry was heading toward extinction.
No way could it compete with coal and natural gas fired plants in a
deregulated market. Never would a utility invest billions of dollars to build
a nuclear power plant when it had no guarantee of recovering that investment
through customer rates, which the architects of deregulation said would only
fall.
No one had ordered a nuclear power plant in this country since 1978, the year
before a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant and eight years
before a nuclear reactor blew up at Chernobyl.
Political support for nuclear power was all but dead, and electric utilities
in the United States knew it.
That was then.
Today, the country's nuclear power industry is looking at California's
troubled experiment with electricity deregulation, environmental concerns
over global warming and an unyielding demand for electricity -- and they see
one thing:
Opportunity.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the future of nuclear power in the U.S.,"
Corbin A. McNeill, Jr., chairman and co-chief executive officer of utility
giant Exelon Corp., told the Irvine symposium.
Nuclear power advocates across the country say the industry is safer, more
efficient and more economically viable than ever before.
"I personally believe there will be a new generation of nuclear power plants
in this country," said Ray Golden, a spokesman for Southern California
Edison's nuclear power plant at San Onofre. "It's a function of when."
Late last month, Senate Republicans introduced an energy bill that could lead
to more nuclear power plants.
The National Energy Security Act, introduced by Sen. Frank Murkowski of
Alaska, would give a big boost to the industry. It would provide nearly $1
billion in research and development money, financial rewards for operators
who make nuclear power plants more efficient, and industrywide tax breaks.
Critics say the bill would just give taxpayer support to a dying industry.
"Clamoring for new subsidies doesn't help the industry make the case that it
is now economically competitive and poised for a resurgence," said
Christopher Sherry, research director for the Safe Energy Communication
Council, a coalition of environmental groups founded after the 1979 accident
at Three Mile Island.
New lease on life
Two primary changes in the nuclear power industry have given advocates reason
to be optimistic.
First, commercial power plants have become more efficient.
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry-backed trade association in
Washington, estimates that improvements in output at the nation's 103
commercial nuclear reactors have added the equivalent of about 25 1,000
megawatt-reactors.
The industry, matured by decades of experience, has improved safety and
shortened routine shutdowns for refueling and maintenance. Electricity
production costs are at an all-time low, at 1.83 cents per kilowatt-hour
(down from 3.12 cents in 1987), making nuclear energy competitive with coal
and natural gas, according to the institute.
Second, the federal government has begun extending operating licenses for
nuclear reactors.
Since last March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has extended the 40-year
operating licenses for five reactors an additional 20 years. The operators of
five more reactors have applied for license extensions, and an additional 28
are expected to seek extensions within the next five years, the institute
said.
Southern California Edison has not decided whether it will seek a license
extension for San Onofre's two remaining reactors, Units 2 and 3, Golden
said. Both are scheduled to be shut down in 2022.
In those reactors that obtain license extensions, utilities see new value,
and a profitable future.
Environmentalists see an avoidable danger.
Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's consumer advocate group, has called extending a
nuclear power plant's license a "high-stakes gamble" that risks safety in
aging plants.
Critical components in a nuclear power plant, including the reactor pressure
vessel that holds nuclear fuel and the thousands of steam generator tubes
that circulate heated and irradiated water, endure extreme stresses and
degrade over time.
"There was a reason (the nation's nuclear power plants) originally had
40-year licenses," said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe Energy
Communication Council.
New sales, new worries
With license extensions, nuclear power plants are now seen by buyers as
profit centers. Six commercial nuclear reactors have been sold since
mid-1999, and the sale of eight reactors is pending, according to the Nuclear
Energy Institute.
The merger of several big utilities has consolidated ownership of commercial
nuclear reactors. The marriage of Commonwealth Edison-Unicom in Illinois and
PECO Energy Co. in Pennsylvania in October created Exelon Corp. and placed 17
reactors under one corporate roof.
McNeill, of Exelon, said the consolidation is creating tremendous economies
of scale that are bringing down operating costs.
Critics worry about a new rivalry between utilities that operate the plants.
"Electricity deregulation sets up a direct competition between power plants,
potentially compromising the safe operation of nuclear power plants as owners
attempt to minimize operation and maintenance costs while maximizing
electricity production and sales," Public Citizen has written.
The environmental group argues that a Feb. 3 electrical fire in the turbine
room of San Onofre's Unit 3 reactor, which occurred as workers were
re-starting the reactor after a routine refueling and maintenance outage,
shows that the industry is not as reliable as advocates would like the public
to believe. Damage caused by the failed circuit breaker that caused the fire
will keep the 1,100-megawatt reactor shut down through mid-May.
"The NRC and the nuclear industry have been skimping on maintenance during
refueling to improve the profitability of nuclear reactors," said Public
Citizen's Jim Riccio, senior policy analyst for the group's Critical Mass
Energy and Environment Program.
Yet, according to reports the company filed Feb. 16 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Southern California Edison, the majority owner of the
San Onofre plant, will lose between $80 million and $100 million because of
the Feb. 3 fire.
That comes at a rough time for the cash-strapped utility.
The San Onofre nuclear power plant is the company's most important asset at a
time when it is near bankruptcy because of skyrocketing electricity costs
from out-of-state power generators.
"San Onofre is the only thing that makes the company money," Golden said.
State's nuclear future
California, the most populous state in the country and the world's sixth
largest economy, has four nuclear reactors -- two at San Onofre and two at
the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo. Yet, those four
nuclear reactors generate more than 4,000 megawatts of electricity, nearly 18
percent of the electricity generated in California.
A third plant, Rancho Seco, near Sacramento, was shut down in 1989 when
voters demanded its closure. Opponents said it was badly run.
Yet, so desperate are state legislators to find sources of power that at
least one has discussed turning Rancho Seco back on. On Feb. 22, state Sen.
Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, introduced a bill to study whether the state
should buy Rancho Seco.
McClintock said the plant could be put back into service in nine months for
$500 million. And, with new turbines, the plant could increase its production
of electricity from 800 megawatts to 1,100 megawatts -- enough power for more
than a million people.
McClintock acknowledges there is little enthusiasm in the state Legislature
for embracing nuclear energy as one answer to California's energy crisis.
"Politically, they're scared to death of it," he said.
John. P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, said the high cost of building nuclear power
plants likely will keep the industry from expanding in the short term.
In the longer term, though, Holdren said nuclear energy could offer a real
alternative to fossil fuels and thereby help combat global warming.
In testimony to Congress last June, he outlined several conditions that must
be met before the nuclear energy production can expand. Among them were some
high hurdles:
The industry must become competitive with other alternative energy sources
that do not emit carbon into the atmosphere, such as hydro-electric power.
Nuclear power plants around the world must prove they are safe.
The nation must find a permanent repository for nuclear waste and build
temporary storage facilities until one opens.
Research into reprocessing used nuclear fuel, which produces a form of
plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons, should be suspended.
Nuclear energy must gain widespread public acceptance.
New breed
If any power company debuts the next generation of nuclear power plants in
the United States, it may very well be Exelon Corp.
The company is helping to finance research in South Africa into a new type of
nuclear reactor, called the "pebble bed modular reactor." The 110-megawatt
reactor, about a tenth the size of conventional nuclear reactors in the
United States, would be designed to eliminate the risk of a meltdown, backers
say.
Passive safety features would eliminate the need for redundant back-up
systems, containment structures and off-site emergency plants, drastically
cutting costs. Because of their modular design, additional reactors could be
added at a single site. McNeill said the new technology could be imported to
the United States and Europe within the next few years.
"A typical plant should be able to generate a kilowatt of electricity for
less than a penny," he said.
Environmental groups have been extremely critical of the design, saying that
it needs some type of containment structure, such as the concrete domes at
San Onofre, to keep radiation from escaping into the atmosphere should
disaster strike.
Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved three designs for
other, more conventional reactors.
McClintock said it's only a matter of time before politicians and the public
re-think their positions on nuclear energy.
The legislator predicts that a shift in opinions will come this summer, when
projections by the California Independent System Operator show that
electricity supply shortages will force blackouts on 6 million people.
"By the time the state has survived the summer of 2001," McClintock said, "as
a practical matter, we'll be forced to take a new look at nuclear energy.
... It is going to be a very ugly, ugly awakening for a lot of politicians
who sat around and did nothing."

Top state power regulator proposes 40 percent rate increase




By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 26, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike
in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage
customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the
hot summer months.
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour.
The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC
meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by
Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the
commission.
Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent
increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems
this summer.
"That number should be all that is needed going forward," she said at a news
conference, "to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of the
state can issue bonds."
Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine
Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary.
Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the
PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already
scheduled for next year.
Lynch also supports a "tiered" rate system that would charge residential and
businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back, a move
aimed at encouraging conservation.
The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can
be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that
rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several
lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate
increase is inevitable.
"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery you are not
going to be able to do this without raising rates," Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton, D-San Francisco, said Monday.
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have
pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would
be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's.
Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San
Diego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to
give the companies cash to pay their bills.
PG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due
to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law
prevents them from collecting from their customers.

Supplier Duke offers to forego some charges




By Leslie Gornstein
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 26, 2001
LOS ANGELES ) A North Carolina energy supplier offered Monday to slice nearly
$20 million off California's emergency power bill for January and February if
its debtors agree to pay.
Under increasing pressure from state and federal regulators, Duke Energy
offered to forego part of what it charged for power during Stage 3 alerts in
January and February.
The power went to California's Independent System Operator, which runs 75
percent of the state's power grid, and to the now-defunct Power Exchange.
North Carolina-based Duke offered to drop $19.8 million in so-called "credit
premiums," but only after the two entities agree to pay $273 per megawatt
hour for power supplied in January and $430 per megawatt hour in February.
ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson refused to comment on the offer.
Duke has not been paid for any power sent to California in January and
February, spokesman Tom Williams said Monday.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said recently that $273 in January
and $430 in February were the highest rates that any supplier could charge
without triggering suspicion of gouging.
Williams would not say how often Duke's rates exceeded those caps during the
two months, nor would he say how many megawatt hours Duke sold to California
during the stretch.
But he did admit Duke often charged more than those rates. He called the
additional charges "credit premiums" ) typical fees within the industry.
Suppliers often charge customers more if they have bad credit or suspect they
will be unable to pay.
FERC has said that Duke potentially owes California $21.14 million in
overcharges for the first two months of the year.
The company's offer was not meant to be an admission of price gouging,
Williams said.
"We have not been paid a dime," Williams said. "It is not unusual to have
credit premiums."
Duke, along with Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing Inc.,
Williams Energy Services Corp., Mirant and Portland General Electric, may
have overcharged California by as much as $125 million in January and
February, FERC has said.
Since the state's power crisis erupted, power at times has cost 15 to 20
times more than it did a year ago.
Before the energy crisis started, electricity was selling at an average
wholesale cost of $30 a megawatt hour.
The crisis stems from 1995 state laws attempting to deregulate the California
power market. The attempt has been criticized for sinking the utilities,
trapping them between state-mandated price caps and soaring electricity
prices on the open market.

PUC to Vote on Big Rate Hike; OK Is Likely

Electricity: Agency chief urges a boost of about 40% for many, and calls it
necessary to raise cash and encourage conservation. Higher cost could show up
in May bills.

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers

SAN FRANCISCO--Millions of Californians would see electricity rates rise
by about 40% under a plan presented Monday by the state's top power regulator.
Loretta Lynch, president of California's Public Utilities Commission,
called rate hikes necessary both to raise cash and to encourage conservation.
Her plan would charge some customers of the state's two biggest private
utilities 3 cents more per kilowatt-hour, depending on how much electricity
they consume. The higher cost would show up in May power bills.
Lynch promised to target the increases on heavy users of electricity and
spare nearly half of residential customers from paying more. The commission
is scheduled to vote on her proposal today, and it is almost certain to win
approval, according to commissioners.
It would cost customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &
Electric a total of $4.8 billion a year.
San Diego Gas & Electric is not covered by the proposed rate hikes,
though officials there said their utility should be.
Nor would the increases affect the customers of municipally owned
utilities in Los Angeles, Riverside, Pasadena, Anaheim and elsewhere.
Lynch's proposal drew fire from consumer advocates, sighs of resignation
from lawmakers and enthusiasm from Wall Street. Stock prices for both
companies jumped by nearly one-third.
For renters and homeowners, the proposal could cost nothing or as much
as 40% more per month. Business customers--who now pay lower rates--could see
even higher increases.
The latest proposed increase would come on top of an average 10% rate
hike for all users imposed in January, which would become permanent under
Lynch's plan. An additional 10% increase for residential and small business
users is already scheduled for this time next year.
"We recognize the utilities are in severe financial distress," Lynch
said. "For utilities to keep the lights on, we unfortunately came to the
conclusion a rate increase was needed."
Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, recently appointed by Davis, predicted that
the plan will pass. Commissioner Richard Bilas, a Republican appointed by
former Gov. Pete Wilson, would not say whether he would vote for Lynch's
proposal but said "rates need to go up."
Davis, who named three of the five commissioners, distanced himself
Monday from the PUC action, saying that it's an independent body. He repeated
that it is his expectation that rate increases can be avoided.
"I've not seen enough information to persuade me we need a rate hike,"
the governor said at a news conference after speaking to students at Walt
Disney Elementary School in Burbank.
If the increase is approved today, Lynch said, it will be refined in the
30 days it takes the utilities to change their billing processes. The rate
increase would be subject to refund if it is more than enough to cover costs
of energy purchases.
Lynch said she cannot finalize the proposal until she gets more
information about power supply and cost projections from the California
Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of
the nearly bankrupt utilities in mid-January. That's when some generators
refused to sell to the utilities for fear of not getting paid.

Utilities Earned Substantial Profits
The utilities have been burdened by wholesale electricity prices that
have topped 10 times the levels of those a year ago.
Rising demand for electricity across the West, plus fundamental flaws in
the design of the deregulated market that California opened in 1998, have
allowed sellers of electricity to earn substantial profits. Since the state
stepped in to buy electricity for the utilities, it has spent about $3
billion covering roughly 34% of the state's power needs.
While Davis has adamantly resisted rate hikes, other politicians have
come to call increases inevitable. The state and utilities need a better cash
flow to cover wholesale power costs expected to soar again this summer, they
say.
And rate boosts will serve another critical purpose, they say, by
prompting Californians to switch off lights, buy efficient refrigerators and
shut down hot tubs. Such conservation will be crucial in whether the state
avoids blackouts, grid operators say.
"If it is tiered right, it wouldn't break my heart," Senate President
Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said, adding that he expects that any
increase will exempt low-income people.
Lynch said repeatedly that the 3-cent-per-kilowatt-hour hike she
proposed should be all that is necessary to allow the state and utilities to
keep buying electricity. The more than $13 billion the utilities claim they
are owed for power purchases since May must be resolved through negotiations
between the governor's office and the utilities, she said.
The Legislature already has approved a bill guaranteeing that those who
use 30% more than their minimal allocation, known as the baseline, won't feel
the hikes.
The baseline is a certain amount of electricity--50% to 60% of the
average residential use per month--that varies regionally, so that a
homeowner in the desert has a higher baseline amount than one living on the
temperate coast. Electricity consumed up to the baseline amount costs less.
Last year, Edison customers paid 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for
electricity. (The average home uses about 700 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours per
month.) The PUC raised that rate to 7.2 cents in January, and Lynch's
proposal would boost it to 10.2 cents.
Edison customers also pay an additional 5.25 cents for distribution,
billing and other costs on top of the electricity charge.
Lynch projects that under her plan about half of Edison's households
would have no monthly bill increases, one-fifth would have an 8% increase,
and fewer than about one-third of the households would have a 27% increase.
Rather than welcome the potential rate hikes, Edison officials said they
were frustrated that the PUC proposal does not guarantee that the higher
rates will cover all of the utility's and the state's costs.
"It helps, but it doesn't solve the problem," said John R. Fielder, a
senior vice president at Edison. "And it's really vulnerable because if it's
not enough, then what do you do?"
Fielder pointed out that when Edison argued for higher rates in
December, it was turned down, causing the utility to accumulate additional
billions in debt. Monday's PUC proposal treats that debt as a "stranded
cost," which the utility could eventually be expected to absorb, he said.
In a two-hour hearing on Lynch's proposal, PG&E lawyer Chris Warner
called it a "a step in the right direction."
"We agree with President Lynch that it's time to pay the power bills,"
he said. Warner declined to elaborate until the utility could study the
proposal further.
Consumer groups immediately attacked the rate hike proposal.
Jason Zeller, an attorney with the PUC's independent Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, complained that "customers had no notice that they would be socked
with the largest rate increase in California history."
"My big concern . . . is it imposes massive increases, damages the
economy, and there is no guarantee it would do any good," Zeller said.
Bob Finkelstein of the Utility Reform Network said: "The focus [of the
PUC] should be to bring prices down, not rates up."
Power sellers in California's market have "an uncanny ability to sniff
out money," Finkelstein said, and the Lynch proposal "only puts more on the
table."
Lynch blamed the need for rate hikes on exorbitant prices for wholesale
electricity, noting that California paid $7.4 billion for electricity in all
of 1999, and $5.2 billion last January. She also blamed the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission for failing to impose a cap on wholesale electricity
prices in California, despite its mandate under federal law to assure
citizens of "just and reasonable" prices.
To plug the $3-billion hole in the state budget and pay for power in
coming months, lawmakers in February passed a law to sell roughly $10 billion
in revenue bonds. The bonds would be paid back with money collected by the
utilities from their customers.
In recent weeks the utilities have argued that little or nothing is left
over after they subtract their own costs of producing and distributing power
from what they collect from monthly bills.
But on Monday, Lynch issued a draft decision that would force the
utilities to send ratepayer revenue to the state based on a formula set by
the PUC.
Representatives of both PG&E and Edison criticized that proposal at
Monday's hearing, saying it gave priority to the state Department of Water
Resources.
Lynch also proposed forcing the utilities to begin paying hundreds of
small energy producers. Some of those renewable and alternative power
generators have not been paid since November. Many have shut down, and their
lost output contributed to rotating blackouts last week.
The potential rate hikes were seen as lessening the possibility of
utility bankruptcy. That sent investors diving into the stocks of Edison
International, parent of Southern California Edison, and PG&E Corp, parent of
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
Edison rocketed $3.35, or 30%, to $14.55 while PG&E shares leaped $3.10,
or 29%, to $13.75. Both stocks have lost considerable value in recent weeks
as the electricity crisis dragged on with no solution.
Investors were not discouraged by PG&E's warning that it might take a
$4.1-billion after-tax charge against 2000 earnings if it concludes that it
will not be able to collect its electricity debts through rates. Edison last
week said it might take a $2.7-billion after-tax charge when earnings are
posted, no later than April 15.

Davis Ducks Reality on Electricity 'Overcharges'
By BENJAMIN ZYCHER AND, GARY B. ACKERMAN


As temperatures rise and the lights go out, let us recall the blessed
memory of Marx. Not Karl. Groucho. Well, not Groucho exactly, but instead the
other star of "You Bet Your Life," his duck, which would descend from the
heavens with a cigar and a crisp $100 bill upon hearing a contestant utter
the secret word of the day.
For Gov. Gray Davis, the magic word is "votes," and he wants to offer
$100 bills to everyone, courtesy of the electric power sector. Davis will
discover during the long, hot summer that it won't work. While he and the
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight
Board have had a grand time chasing each other around a room with whipped
cream pies and seltzer bottles, the economic and political risks faced by
producers have grown, the state budget reserve largely has gone poof! and
efforts both rhetorical and political to force other Western states to bail
California out predictably have come a cropper.
And so the buck-passing season is in full bloom. Accordingly, we now
have studies from the Independent System Operator--the board of which was
appointed by Davis--purporting to show that recent prices charged by power
producers have exceeded costs, and thus have been unreasonable to the tune of
$6.3 billion, concluding that the current mess is all their fault, and that
everyone should get big refunds.
Well. It all depends on what your definition of "cost" is. The ISO
analysis ignores the risks of nonpayment, now very real in the California
market, to the tune of $14 billion owed by the utilities, largely to power
producers and traders. The interest costs on late payment are ignored. The
ISO shunts aside the risks of unplanned outages of generating equipment,
necessitating the purchase of power in volatile spot markets. It ignores the
market value of investment in reliability, the political risks of
after-the-fact changes in the rules of the game, the risks posed by the
lawsuit industry, the risks of transmission breakdowns, the risks of rising
prices for natural gas and on and on. That a number of important costs faced
by power producers do not show up on the books does not mean that they are
not real.
More fundamentally, the mere fact that prices are high does not
demonstrate that the market is noncompetitive. It is not costs that determine
prices in competitive markets, it is the relationship between cost and demand
conditions. Suppose sudden bad weather destroys a substantial part of the
wheat crop. The price of wheat will rise, despite the fact that costs as
measured by the accountants--the price of fuel and other inputs--will not
have increased at all.
The ISO and others attempt to circumvent this simple reality by offering
exotic theories o
