Daren:

Sorry it has taken so long to get back to this issue, I am with EES now.
Karen Lindley allocates this point but I feel the need to help her because
this issue came to light while I was in transition.

Exxon allocates this point and we receive a allocation statement from them on
a monthly basis.

December 2000
The total flow at the meter was 646 MMBtu.  I copied Esther Garcia on this
e-mail so that she can look into the possibility that there is a measurement
error.  Esther will need to respond to Karen on the matter of the possible
measurement error.  Furthermore it seems odd to me that scheduling had 8,928
MMBtu confirmed at this point and only 646 MMBtu flowed.  I would ask Mark
where he got his confirmed volumes from.  As a temporary fix I reallocated
the meter and gave the total flow to Alpine Resources.  They will be short
paid in their minds until Ester and Karen can get the possible measurement
error issue resolved.  I would also suggest that Mark and Karen get together
to review the scheduling of this point so that Karen can call Exxon to
reconcile their allocation with what we have (the additional Alpine deal) at
this point.  Charlene can redraft her invoice on Monday 2/26/01 that will
show the 646 MMBtu going to Alpine.

January 2001
Again scheduling has 9,193 confirmed at this meter when on 3,241 MMBtu
flowed.  I temporarily reallocated the meter so that the entire volume that
flowed went to Alpine.  They remain 10 MMBtu short paid but Charlene can
redraft her invoice and pay them something until Mark (validity of other
deals at this point) and Karen (Exxon's allocation of this point) can get
this issue resolved.

There is also the issue with the Exxon transport at this point that was
scheduled at 1,500 MMBtu per month for the months in question.  This
transport affects the allocation at the King Ranch tailgate on the Exxon 024
contract.  I copied Howard Camp who will be training the contractor that will
take my place in Volume Management so that he can stay on top of the
resolution of this issue.
