In Congress' final effort to pass remaining appropriations bills this year,
there have been rumors circulating that an attempt may be made to soemhow
insert pipeline safety legislation.  While several members have kept the
issue on their "wish lists" of items they would like to see in last-minute
appropriations legislation, most would prefer that pipeline safety be dealt
with in the next Congress -- see the attached article referencing Sen. John
McCain's desire to handle it next year.  I would consider it highly unlikely
to see pipeline safety included in the final package.

MCCAIN WANTS PIPELINE SAFETY BILL OUT OF FINAL SPENDING PACKAGE:
Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has asked the Senate
leadership to keep a pipeline safety overhaul out of the final appropriations
bill. In a letter to Majority Leader Trent Lott, Miss., and Appropriations
Committee Chairman Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, McCain expressed reservations about
inclusion of the pipeline bill (S 2438), which the Senate passed by unanimous
consent on Sept. 7. McCain wrote that while he supports the legislation, he
does not want authorizing provisions in the final appropriations bill. He
added that the legislation "is the product of months of work and bipartisan
negotiations by the Senate Commerce Committee ... and should in no way be
weakened to appease organized labor or any other special interest group." The
measure failed in the House Oct. 10. The 232-158 vote fell short of the
two-thirds majority required for passage under suspension of the rules.
