Rick,

Beautiful.

I would like to add that we got the benefit of this method of calculating prejudgment interest because the arbitrators specifically adopted Northern's prejudgment interest methodology, which was based on the fine work Harry, Tangi and you did on our post-hearing briefs.

Of even more significance,  the panel specifically noted KN's course of performance of using our meter numbers for its monthly plant settlements when the panel rejected ONEOK's argument that ONEOK had never "accepted" the meters.  Harry and Tangi brought this evidence to our attention at the outset of this litigation, and it became a centerpiece argument for us. With their and your fine work (and the unbelievable hours all of you put in, late at night, early in the morning, on the weekends, and frequently on an emergency basis, with little or no notice), you made ONEOK's attorneys very unhappy with your testimony at the hearing.  I loved it.

This was a team effort, and congratulations are due all the way around.  It was my great pleasure to have partnered with you on this.

Britt
