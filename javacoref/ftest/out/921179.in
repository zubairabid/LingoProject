The summer reception has been scheduled at Jalapeno's (same as last
year), 2702 Kirby Drive (just south of Westheimer), 713-524-1668 for
July 26 from 5:30 to 8 pm. I should be receiving the menu options
this week.

Have any of you received sponsorship pledges from your companies? If
you have, please let me know the company and the amount. We still
need some so that we won't have to dip into the reserves. Please also
try asking your classmates who work in Houston about their companies
sponsoring this event. I am also trying at my end.

If you need to reach me: home: 281-218-6598, cell: 713-703-4312

Thanks for your help,

Glenn.
