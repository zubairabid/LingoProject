Good to have you back, Kay.  I was very sorry to hear about your father passing away. I hope you are doing OK --  Please accept my condolences.
Regarding your questions:
1. I believe you have an electronic copy of the lease between UST and CES.  There is also a term sheet which I will try to dig up.  I will ask UST if a signed lease exists.
2. Working on the RTU -- I am told we will have it "any day."  We shall see.
3. Should CES or their attys have this?  I will ask them.  It would nonetheless be good to investigate the bankruptcy proceeding independently to verify things (and to see what CES paid for the switch).  Can you do this?
I will be reachable Friday at 732-887-0215 and back in Houston Monday.
