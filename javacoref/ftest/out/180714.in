New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed
the state is headed in the wrong direction.
And it may get worse. Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy
to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon,
according to a new poll.
The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in
early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll
was conducted in English and Spanish.
The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis.
"Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other
growth-related problems," said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's
survey director. "This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely
undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders."
Change has come swiftly.
In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the
right direction, compared to 48 percent this month.
Other key findings include:
82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years will
make California a less desirable place to live.
86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's
economy.
43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32
percent in January. The second most popular solution, re-regulating the
electricity industry, was the favored solution in January.
Traffic congestion, affordable housing, air pollution and a shortage of good
jobs top the list of negative consequences respondents foresee from the
state's population growth.














Grid officials, others studying planned blackouts
By Jennifer Coleman
Associated Press Writer
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report,
a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast?
It's not out of the question, say some lawmakers.
"I actually think it's a thoughtful plan ... to give folks an opportunity to
understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis," Assemblyman Fred
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on energy.
Keeley compared it to "weather forecasting, to be able to look at the next
three or four days, have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts."
The Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid, is
expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work.
The idea is "to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to
live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer," Keeley said.
Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine, economics professor,
released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state
set a price limit on what they'll pay for power. And if generators don't
lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he
said.
The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the
state's current method of "highly disruptive random rolling blackouts" needs
to be revamped.
UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities
could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for
a certain duration.
Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley
acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for
traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off.
"That is a genuine problem and genuine concern," Keeley said. "I think we
would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient
advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources
appropriately."
Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their
unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies
short.
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that
would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners
as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut.
"We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule," Briggs said. "If
businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be
shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly."
The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be
especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops.
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on
blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily
blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic
Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan.
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers
three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular
period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to
nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends.
And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the
state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said.
California power consumers would in essence form "a reverse cartel to stop
the market manipulation and the price gouging," she said.
The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly
concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the
extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three
cash-strapped privately owned utilities.
Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point
last week.
The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for
Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and
Electric.
Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4
billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15
years.

Governor told to try seizure in power war



By Philip J. LaVelle
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 19, 2001
A major San Diego business group urged Gov. Gray Davis yesterday to take
emergency steps in the energy crisis, including seizing power plants -- an
action the governor said may be in the cards.
Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego
Building Owners and Managers Association, overseers of about 250 commercial
properties here.
The meeting, at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown, was closed
to the media.

In remarks to reporters later, Davis repeated his hard line against
out-of-state energy producers, relating a threat made to a dozen power
executives in a private meeting May 9.

"I told the generators face to face, as close as I am to you ...
'Gentlemen, you are going to lose your plants, and I'm going to sign a
windfall-profits tax, unless you help us get through this summer without
blackouts and without staggering prices.'"
Davis also said he told them: "You know you've been ripping us off, acting in
a predatory manner. If you do it this summer, you leave me no choice but to
take your plants and sign a windfall-profits tax. So the ball is in your
court, gentlemen."
Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had "a frank
exchange" with Davis. "We want to do our fair share (on conservation), but
we're also concerned about the supply side," he said. The group "strongly
urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary, including
seizing plants."
Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of
conservation measures. Yet some cannot be implemented without state
intervention, she said. For example, Davis urged that air-conditioning
thermostats be set at 78 degrees, but "a lot of our leases don't permit it,"
she said.
While in San Diego, Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree from
Scripps Research Institute.





Davis intensifies attacks on Texas firms



By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 19, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is stepping up his attacks on Texas energy
companies, shifting blame in the California electricity crisis to the home
state of President Bush.
"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price-gouging us,"
Davis told reporters while responding to Bush's energy plan this week. "Many
of those companies are in Texas."
The governor suggested that most of the power plants that California
utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan were purchased by energy
companies in the Southwest.
Anyone could have purchased the California power plants, Davis said, "but the
people who bought them just happened to be from the Southwest ... "
However, a state Energy Commission report shows that when California
utilities sold more than 20 power plants capable of producing 20,000
megawatts, Texas firms purchased plants producing about 7,000 megawatts.
Davis also suggested that the Bush administration is failing to give
California the same price relief on electricity that Texas has imposed on
itself.
"So if Texas can have some kind of price relief," Davis said, "I think
California is entitled to price relief."
But the cap that Texas adopted in March prevents energy companies from
offering to sell power for more than $1,000 per megawatt-hour -- far above
the $346 average that California expects to pay for non-contracted power this
spring.
The campaign operation for Davis, who is up for re-election next year and has
been mentioned as a potential Bush opponent in 2004, distributed a news
release yesterday saying that "Davis is emerging as a national spokesman for
the Democrats on energy issues."
The governor yesterday appointed two members of former Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore's campaign, Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane, as
interim communication consultants. He named Gore's former deputy chief of
staff, Nancy McFadden, as senior adviser.
The governor will give the Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address
today.
While Davis blames the Lone Star State, none of Pacific Gas and Electric's
power plants, which produce 7,400 megawatts, was sold to Texas firms. They
were sold to Duke of North Carolina, Mirant of Georgia, and Calpine of
California.
The biggest purchaser of Southern California Edison power plants was AES
Corp. of Virginia, which obtained 4,706 megawatts. Reliant, a Texas firm,
bought plants from Edison that can produce 4,000 megawatts.
Destec of Houston and NRG Energy of Minneapolis purchased two Edison plants
with an output of 1,583 megawatts. Dynegy of Houston and NRG Energy purchased
plants producing 1,347 megawatts from San Diego Gas and Electric.
Davis has said in nationally televised interviews that there is an historic
transfer of wealth from California to Houston. A large electricity marketing
firm with close ties to Bush, Enron, also is based in Houston.
But Davis has focused much of his criticism on Reliant, whose profits soared
last year. Reliant openly rejected Davis' call last week for generators to
accept a 30 percent reduction in the debt they are owed by California
utilities.
Reliant also was the only generator that appealed a federal court order to
provide emergency power to California. Davis began singling out Reliant after
it charged the state $1,900 per megawatt hour for emergency power needed by
the California grid.
Reliant's president, Joe Bob Perkins, said in a teleconference with
California reporters yesterday that Reliant charged the high price because it
did not want to run a small reserve plant that can only be used for a limited
number of days.
The state of California, which has spent about $7 billion buying power for
utility customers since January, made emergency purchases of 336 megawatt
hours from Reliant on May 9 and 10, paying $1,900 per megawatt hour for a
total of $638,400.
In Texas, the Public Utilities Commission adopted a $1,000 per megawatt hour
cap on bids to supply emergency power as a "circuit-breaker" in case prices
somehow skyrocketed after Texas deregulates next year.
"I realize that amount has been reached in California," said Terry Hadley, a
spokesman for the Texas PUC. "Nothing close to that has been reached in
Texas."
Hadley said the most paid for emergency power by the Texas grid operator was
$500 per megawatt hour in 1999. He said the average price is $47 to $48 per
megawatt hour.
Texas has a surplus of power, unlike California, which has to import about 20
percent of its power. Texas also has a self-contained power grid that covers
about 85 percent of the state, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and
Austin. California is part of a sprawling Western power grid.
Davis and others have been pushing for wholesale price caps on power in the
West. The Texas PUC rejected price caps and adopted a high bid cap as a
fail-safe, saying that would still allow prices to signal whether new power
plants are needed.
The governor yesterday also appointed a new energy adviser, Kellan Fluckiger,
who is on loan from the Independent System Operator, which operates the
California power grid.






Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation



ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
LOS ANGELES ) The head of the California Public Utilities Commission provided
a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduced
electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.
While testifying before the committee Friday, PUC President Loretta Lynch
displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at
three plants on a single day last November.
According to the graphs, after the plants reduced production during the
middle of the day, the state was forced to declare two separate power
emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low.
After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices, the companies
operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to
almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates.
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which is
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and
playing, to an extent, California."
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said.
She would not identify the power plants involved, however, Lynch did say that
they are owned by at least two companies.
Sen. Joseph Dunn, who heads the special committee investigating alleged
market manipulation, said Lynch's testimony, on its face, is "very damning."
He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing
that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior.
During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of major
power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no
coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits.
"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy
Producers Association.
The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and
brought major utilities to financial ruin





California economy braces for $5.7 billion electric rate hike



By Michael Liedtke
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) Higher power costs zapped restauranteur Marino Sandoval and
his customers even before California regulators decided this week how to
allocate a $5.7 billion electricity rate hike ) the highest in the state's
history.
Faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill, Sandoval
last month raised the prices at his popular Mexican restaurant chain, El
Balazo, by as much as 20 percent on some items. A giant burrito that cost
$4.95 at the end of March costs $5.95 Saturday.
"We had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything, from our
beans to our tortillas, was going up almost every day. Our higher prices have
everything to do with the higher energy prices," said Sandoval, who runs six
restaurants in San Francisco and the East Bay.
From hotels to bagel shops, businesses throughout California have been
raising their prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power
costs. Most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs,
which utilities have been passing along to their customers throughout the
state's power crisis.
Now, businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases
that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the state's two biggest
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co.
The higher rates, which will begin appearing in June's utility bills,
threaten to jolt the state's already jittery economy.
"Pretty soon, we may see California staring down the barrel of a recession,"
said Dave Puglia, a vice president for APCO, a public affairs firm hired by
California business interests to study the economic effect of the state's
energy woes.
Until now, California businesses have only had to pay a fraction of the
state's staggering electricity bill, which is on a pace to reach $70 billion
this year ) about 10 times more than in 1999.
By itself, the $5.7 billion rate increase approved by the California Public
Utilities Commission probably isn't enough to topple the state's roughly $1
trillion economy ) the sixth largest in the world.
"It will cause some hardships, particularly for some small business owners,
but from the macro point of view, these rate increases aren't going to have a
major impact on California's output," predicted Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist for Wells Fargo & Co., which runs the biggest bank headquartered in
the state.
But some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de
grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline,
natural gas, health care benefits and workers' compensation insurance.
Against this backdrop, many employers also face pressure to raise their
workers' wages to help pay for California's high housing costs.
"If this keeps up, at some point, we are going to reach a breaking point in
the economy," said Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of
Commerce.
The California Chamber is part of the California Alliance for Energy and
Economic Stability, a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricity
rate increase from businesses to households.
Under the plan approved by the PUC, businesses are expected to pay about $4.6
billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional $1.1
billion.
Even if they are spared on their utility bills, consumers still will be
pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along
their electricity price increases.
Some California firms, particularly those making commodities sold around the
world, won't be able to substantially raise their prices without losing
business from customers who will buy from competitors in other states and
countries.
Manufacturers of cement, glass, paper products and steel are among the
companies that probably won't be able to pass along their higher energy
costs, Puglia said.
The rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about 25 percent to
30 percent of a big manufacturer's budget, Puglia estimated, up from about 15
percent now.
"I wouldn't be surprised if we see some companies go out of business because
of this," said Justin Bradley, director of energy programs for the Silicon
Valley Manufacturing Association, a high-tech trade group.
Even if they don't shut down completely, many companies likely will lay off
workers as they cut costs to pay for power. The California Manufacturers and
Technology Association estimates that the energy crisis will result in the
loss of 135,755 jobs ) or about 40,000 more than the entire dot-com industry
has laid off nationwide during the past 16 months.
Painful though they may be, higher electricity rates and some resulting
layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number of blackouts that
probably would have occurred if retail prices hadn't been raised, according
to most economists.
"People are wildly exaggerating how much this is going to hurt the California
economy," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of
the California Economy, a Palo Alto research firm. "The rate increases are
part of a long-term solution for California. We needed them to stabilize the
market. On balance, this is a good thing."
Even though his monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from
$1,500 last year to $4,500 this year, El Balazo's Sandoval shares Levy's
optimism. After all, customers continue to pour into his restaurants, despite
his restaurant's higher menu prices.
"Business is so good that I have been too busy to think about whether I am
going to have to raise my prices again," he said. "If I have to, I will. I
don't think people are going to stop eating because of this."





Price information sought from natural gas companies



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
WASHINGTON ) A federal regulatory agency late Friday directed natural gas
companies selling in California to provide detailed information for better
investigations of possible price gouging and market abuses.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it viewed the unusually high
prices of wholesale natural gas in California as "a matter of serious
concern" but didn't have enough information to determine if they are illegal.
It noted that the spot price of natural gas charged at the California border
has been exceedingly high since December when it ranged between $11.79 and
$18.80 per thousand cubic feet, compared to $4 to $7 elsewhere in the county.
The most recent prices at the California border exceed $9, more than twice
the wholesale price in other parts of the country. Such a disparity over such
a long period of time would not be expected in a competitive market, the
agency said.
California officials have argued for months that FERC should intervene and
more aggressively investigate high natural gas prices, which have been a
major cause of some of the run-up in electricity costs in the state. Many of
the state's power plants run on natural gas.
The order asks for a wide range of information at the end of each calendar
quarter including volumes of gas sold, prices, transportation rates, daily
operational pipeline capacity and volumes flowing in and out of the state.
Allegations of price gouging and market manipulation have been at the center
of a hearing by a FERC administrative law judge all this week. The hearing
will continue next week.
The case involves a major natural gas pipeline owned by the Houston-based El
Paso Corp., which supplies Southern California.
California regulators, and two of the states financially troubled utilities,
filed a formal complaint with FERC, alleging that manipulation by two El Paso
subsidiaries ) one a gas marketer and the other an operator of the pipeline )
led to $3.7 billion in natural gas overcharges since March 2000.
El Paso Corp. has strongly denied the allegation.
For the past week, attorneys for El Paso have questioned witnesses from the
California Public Utilities Commission in an attempt to disprove the charges.
The witnesses admitted they failed to consider some additional factors that
could have affected prices in their analyses, but they did not back away from
their conclusion.
In support of their argument, California officials have provided internal El
Paso memos ) which have not been disclosed publicly ) that allegedly discuss
market control in connection with gas flowing through the pipeline.
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner has said the documents contain
statements "that could lead one to believe there was an abuse" of pipeline
capacity. He is not expected to make a ruling on the case until later this
summer. A final decision on what action to take, if any, would be up to the
full commission.






Davis Sharpens Attack on Bush Energy Plan
Power: He also hires high-profile consultants in effort to boost his
political standing.

By DAN MORAIN and MARK Z. BARABAK, Times Staff Writers


SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis is going on the attack as the Democratic
Party's point man against President Bush's energy plan, even as he seeks to
bolster his drooping standing in California by hiring consultants who honed
their crisis-management skills during the scandal-ridden Clinton
administration.
Davis was expected to again criticize Bush's energy plan today as he
makes the official Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address.
In the last week, Davis has variously blasted the president's energy
plan and Texas energy companies on an ABC talk show, on CNN, and in an
opinion piece for the Washington Post. In an interview with Associated Press,
Davis vowed to "hold everyone accountable: myself, the energy producers and
the president of the United States."
"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging
us," Davis said Friday. "Many of those companies are in Texas. Mr. President,
you didn't create this problem, but you are the only one who can solve it."
At the same time, Davis all but acknowledged his own political problems
when he announced that he has retained two political aides, Mark Fabiani and
Chris Lehane. The two, who also do work for Southern California Edison, will
be paid by taxpayers at a combined rate of $30,000 per month--more than the
$13,750 earned by the governor himself.
Lehane, known for his tart-tongued commentary, was Vice President Al
Gore's main campaign spokesman, and had a knack for getting under Bush's skin
during the 2000 campaign.
Fabiani, a Harvard law school graduate, became a highly partisan and
acerbic White House defender when President Clinton was mired in
investigations ranging from the Whitewater land deal to the Monica Lewinsky
affair. Fabiani developed his reputation for being able to handle crises
while defending Mayor Tom Bradley against various investigations near the end
of the late mayor's tenure.
In political circles, the nickname of their firm is Masters of Disaster.
Davis' decision to retain Lehane and Fabiani comes as the governor's
once-sterling poll numbers have fallen sharply and he faces persistent
criticism over his handling of the energy crisis.
Their arrival also corresponds to Davis' increasingly aggressive stand
on the energy crisis. In recent days, Davis for the first time has attacked
an individual generator, Reliant Energy of Houston, for charging a record
$1,900 per megawatt for electricity on two days last week. He also dared
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to "stand up" to their
"friends" in the energy business by capping wholesale electricity prices
charged in California.
Davis' more assertive stance comes as Democrats nationwide step up their
attacks on the president, using the energy plan to launch a broader assault
on Bush's leadership and policies.
"One of the glaring flaws in the Bush energy plan is that it offers no
short-term relief for consumers," said Dan Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the
Democratic Governors Assn., which Davis chairs. "And there is no better
example of that than the fact he does nothing to control runaway prices in
California."
In addition to portraying Bush as ignoring the plight of California--the
nation's largest electoral prize--Democrats see Bush's energy response as a
way of confirming their broader assertion that he is captive to oil interests.
"This is a way for us to show how they are really an administration and
a party that is bought and paid for by special interests," said Jenny Backus,
a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
To press the case, the party has created a snide Web
site--www.grandoldpetroleum--and will soon start running TV ads attacking GOP
lawmakers over the energy issue, including in California.
Paul Maslin, the governor's pollster, said Davis had given the president
a grace period after he took office in January to see how Bush would address
the energy problem. But the governor grew increasingly frustrated when it
became clear "we weren't going to get any help from Washington."
For his part, Bush made glancing reference to California in a speech
Friday at a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, part of his tour to sell the
administration's energy blueprint. The president praised Californians for
doing "a fantastic job in conservation."
"And yet they're lacking energy. They're having blackouts," Bush said.
"We all must be deeply concerned about our fellow citizens in the great state
of California. But the problems in California show that you cannot conserve
your way to energy independence."
While Bush did not mention the governor, the president's deputies have
rushed to criticize him.
Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, head of the Republican National Committee,
suggested Davis was hypocritical to attack Bush when "the president is the
one who came forward with the first energy plan we've seen in years."
"He's going to have to answer the question of what he's done as
governor," Gilmore said. "While he's in the process of attacking, one might
suspect he may be diverting attention away from his own record."
On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine
Todd Whitman was overheard criticizing Davis to Iowa Republican Party
official Darrell Kearney.
"He's had plenty of time to do something, and he hasn't done anything,"
she said as she left a meeting room in Nevada, Iowa, where Bush had just
finished speaking.
Some more independent observers see political liabilities in the Bush
plan, namely the focus on long-term solutions at a time voters are growing
increasingly upset about high gas prices and soaring utility bills.
"While [the administration] talks about how we approach things in the
next five years, there's not a lot of empathy or understanding for what's
affecting people now," said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political
analyst in Washington.
"Maybe it's unfair to talk about Bush and Cheney's oil backgrounds and
Texas backgrounds," Rothenberg said. "But it's an obvious thing for critics
to do."
Rothenberg predicted a backlash that could cost Republicans control of
Congress next year, "if the energy issue continues to grow and Americans
really become concerned. . . . It puts the burden on the White House and
Republicans to change that."
Davis' new aides, while considered expert in solving the kind of
political crisis threatening Davis, pose the potential of controversy on
their own.
As consultants, Lehane and Fabiani, unlike government officials, are not
required to file conflict of interest statements detailing their holdings and
sources of income.
However, in an interview on Friday, Lehane acknowledged that he and
Fabiani have worked for about two months as consultants for Southern
California Edison. He insisted there is no conflict.
Davis is struggling to win legislative approval of a deal he struck with
Edison to rescue the utility from bankruptcy. Several lawmakers oppose the
deal, contending that it is too rich for Edison.
"Both sides [Edison and Davis] are in agreement on what needs to be done
here," Lehane said. "As the governor said . . . we are literally in a war
with these out-of-state generators."
Although Lehane and Fabiani will be working on broader communications
issues for Davis, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union, a critic of the
Davis-Edison deal, blasted Davis' decision to hire consultants who also work
for the utility.
"Davis has done everything politically wrong," Snyder said. "He hasn't
done anything that is consistent with the democratic process. It is the worst
abuse of power that I have seen in 25 years of lobbying."
Others suggested that Davis was helping himself by bringing the duo
aboard.
"Mark is the premier crisis manager in the country in terms of
communication strategy," Democratic political consultant Bill Carrick said.
"He has tremendous experience. . . . He takes the incoming. You get hit with
something in the morning. He knows how to turn it around by the afternoon."
Lehane said the governor's decision to hire them does not suggest Davis
will become more pugnacious, although he added that Davis is "not someone
afraid to pick a fight when someone, like the out-of-state generators,
represent policies that are bad for the people of California."
"Gov. Davis has been very successful in politics for quite some time in
this state," Lehane said. "He has a keen understanding of how this state
works and how politics in this state works. I don't think his style is going
to change or be any different than he has been throughout his career."

PUC Allegations Detailed
Hearing: The commission president tells a Senate panel that maintenance
records show no valid reason for generators to cut power production.

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers


The head of the California Public Utilities Commission Friday provided
fresh details showing that power generators scaled back electricity
production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.
In sworn testimony before a state Senate committee, PUC President
Loretta Lynch said the companies' behavior helped drain so much electricity
from the state's grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alerts.
Lynch's testimony followed her comments Thursday to The Times that state
investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down
unnecessarily to create "artificial shortages," often when the state was most
desperate for electricity.
During her testimony Friday, Lynch went beyond her assertions about
unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly
throttling back generation.
The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and
brought major utilities to financial ruin.
Generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to
manipulate wholesale electricity prices, including unnecessarily shutting
down their plants or reducing supply. The facilities, theysay, are aging and
have run so hard during the state's crisis that they often require extensive
maintenance.
But the details released by Friday by Lynch added to the questions
surrounding the generators' activities.
Lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power
generation at three plants on a single day last November. After the plants
reduced production during the middle of the day, the graphs show, the state
was forced to declare two separate power emergencies because electricity
reserves had fallen seriously low.
The shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices. With that, the
companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity
production to almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much
higher rates.
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which
isinvestigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and
playing, to an extent, California."
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no
valid reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said. She declined
to identify the power plants involved, saying only that they are owned by at
least two companies.
Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana), who heads the special committee
investigating alleged market manipulation, said Lynch's information, on its
face, is "very damning."
He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence
showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar
behavior.
"We are looking at data that is suspicious," Dunn said.
During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of
major power suppliers said there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink
supplies to increase profits.
"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy
Producers Assn.
She said many of the plants bought by out-of-state generators under
California's flawed deregulation plan are more than 30 years old. The plants
have been running at high levels to help the state with its energy crunch,
she said.
Muoz told reporters that the plants owned by out-of-state companies
last year produced 60% more electricity than the previous year.
Although no firm has been singled out by the PUC or the attorney
general's office, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said inspectors have visited
company plants more than 100 times this year and have found no wrongdoing.
"Mirant has run its plants voluntarily and continually throughout the
crisis," the company said in a statement Friday.
But Lynch said Friday that visits to more than 80 plants by PUC
investigators since December show that generators are not always producing
all the power they can.
"It appears that there have been numerous instances within the past
half-year where generation units were not producing the amount of electricity
that they were capable of producing," Lynch said.

Utility Exec Rejects the Governor's Criticism
Power: Leader of Reliant Energy defends policies and says Davis' rhetoric
could harm California.

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer


SACRAMENTO--The top executive of a Houston-based energy company singled
out for criticism this week by Gov. Gray Davis defended his company Friday
and warned that the governor's rhetoric will ultimately hurt California.
"On Wednesday we were called obstructionist," said Joe Bob Perkins,
chief executive of Reliant Energy, which bought five Southern California
power plants when the state launched deregulation in 1998.
"I don't think it's obstructionist to supply record amounts of power
from old plants in order to keep the lights on," Perkins said. "I don't think
it's obstructionist to invest more than $80 million in 2000 alone to upgrade
the plants and reduce emission levels. I don't think it's obstructionist to
continue to run our facilities at times when there's been no guarantee of
payment."
In a telephone conference call with reporters, Perkins said, "California
officials must lessen the rhetoric and focus on efforts to mitigate the
impacts of summer blackouts."
Perkins said threats of windfall profits taxes and plant seizures could
scare off substantial business from California.
For months, Davis has disparaged private power plant owners in
California as gougers and profiteers, but until last week he did not single
out individual companies.
Last Thursday, after state power buyers paid an extraordinary $1,900 per
megawatt-hour, Davis broke the confidentiality he had maintained on state
power purchases and named Reliant as the seller.
Reliant has sued to get out of its obligation to sell power to the state
and refused to discuss forgiving some portion of the $307 million it is owed
by California utilities.
"They're one of only a couple of generators that say absolutely no way,
no how are they going to negotiate for anything less than 100%," Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio said after the Reliant executive's remarks.
The governor's recent attack has made some Reliant officials wonder if
he is building a case to seize control of its power plants. Davis has
threatened to commandeer plants to bring down wholesale power costs.
Perkins said his company set a high price last week to discourage the
state from buying the power, which was produced at a small, inefficient plant
near Santa Barbara that cannot run more than nine days a year because of air
pollution regulations.
Reliant officials said they wanted to reserve the plant for use later
this summer.
Maviglio said Reliant's argument "defies logic."
"When you make a bid . . . you want somebody to buy the power."

PUC Chief Alleges Price Collusion
Power: She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create "artificial
shortages." An industry spokesman calls the accusation "idiocy."

By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ, Times Staff Writers

State investigators have uncovered evidence that a "cartel" of power
companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices,
the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday.
PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency, working with the state
attorney general's office, is probing patterns of plant outages that have
created "artificial shortages," particularly when the state has issued
emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity.
"There are instances where plants could have produced, and they chose
not to," Lynch said in an interview at The Times.
"And it is clear that there are instances that plants, when called to
produce, chose not to produce," even when they were obligated to do so under
special contracts with the state and utility companies.
Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough
information for the PUC and attorney general's office to take legal action
against the generators next month. The exact nature of that action, she said,
is still under review.
Lynch, who is an attorney, did not name specific suppliers or provide
documentation of her assertions. She said that information will remain
confidential until court proceedings are undertaken.
Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power market
in any unlawful way, including orchestrating plant shutdowns. They say the
facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis that
breakdowns are a recurring problem.
Lynch and Gov. Gray Davis, who has been particularly critical of
out-of-state generators, have not suggested that every plant shutdown has
been unwarranted.
In fact, the governor's top advisor on power plants released a statement
last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was
justified and that the company's officials were "accommodating."
State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joint
investigation with the PUC. A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyer's
office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wide-ranging probe of
possible civil and criminal violations.
So far, the attorney general's office has subpoenaed documents in 91
categories from generators, including records of plant operations, pricing
practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another
about California's power market.
"We're looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair
business practice laws," Lockyer has told The Times.
Although he has not provided details of his office's findings, he
recently said the inquiry is "beginning to get interesting."
Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amassed
during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous
subpoenaed records, obtained after intense legal battles with the power
companies.
In addition, investigators have been entering plants where unplanned
shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records, Lynch
said. At times, the investigators have been denied access and have had to
exert legal pressure to get in, she said.
The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices, which
have gone from $200 a megawatt-hour in December to as high as $1,900 last
week.
"I would argue it's no accident," Lynch said of the high prices. "That
in fact it's [due to] the coordinated behavior of a cartel."
The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the
rules of California's flawed deregulation program, which allowed them to buy
power plants formerly run by the state's three largest utilities.
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for a trade association of large power
producers, said Lynch's allegations were "the height of idiocy."
The reason many plants have been down in recent months, he said, is that
power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer
demand.
He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing
because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies.
"My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their
competitors can make money," said Ackerman, executive director of the Western
Power Trading Forum.
State analysts have argued, however, that power traders can reap
extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power
that is sold are so high.
According to Lynch, investigators have found that some companies were
more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulate
the state's power market.
She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern: When
operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage 1 alert--meaning that
electricity reserves have dropped below 7%--plants that do not need repairs
suddenly are yanked offline. That, she said, aggravates the shortages, and
the cost of wholesale electricity soars.
Before December, state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up
prices primarily through bidding. At the time, the market was designed to pay
all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the state's grid operator.
That changed in December, when new federal regulations restructured
California's wholesale power market to loosen price controls, Lynch said.
Since then, a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emerged--"not coincidentally
in my view," she said. Now, she added, the state has endured "historically
high levels of unplanned plant outages."
The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by
utility companies because they have not been "going off [line] at record
levels," Lynch said.
The California Energy Commission reported last week that the state's
electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several
times higher than in the last two years.
A Times analysis of state data found that, throughout the last two
months, about 12,000 megawatts of production was offline, more than a third
of the peak power used in California on a typical day. That has been about
evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns.
By contrast, shutdowns in the same period of 1999 and 2000 took only
3,300 to 5,700 megawatts offline.
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electricity
supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay $8 million in
connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise
prices. The company agreed to settle the case without admitting any
wrongdoing.
However, FERC released a study in February of closures at three other
California plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcity
of power.
After talking to plant operators by telephone, reviewing documents and
visiting the three plants, federal inspectors concluded that "the companies
appeared to have taken whatever steps were necessary to bring the generating
facilities back online as soon as possible by accelerating maintenance and
incurring additional expenses."

Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark
Effect: President's energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the
power-deprived Golden State.

By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS, Times Staff Writers

California lawmakers, analysts and others waist-deep in the state's
power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House
energy plan:
By the time many of President Bush's proposals kick in, it will be too
late to do the Golden State much good.
"This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the
next critical 18 months," groused state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey).
"You can't focus just on the long term here. Because the patient will be dead
before we get the life-support systems in place."
Gov. Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to
help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are
draining California's treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases.
Instead, the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an
expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil, increased reliance on nuclear
power and more than $10 billion in tax credits for conservation and energy
development.
Most of Bush's proposals, however, are slow-acting remedies, and many
others already are being applied in California, which was hit by energy woes
far ahead of other states.
The plan's dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or
promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from
blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices, experts say.
"Overall, the message in this plan is, 'Drop dead, California,' " said
Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based research and
advocacy group.
"I don't think it delivers another megawatt to California," added
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the
power crisis as an ongoing emergency, rather than a temporary one.
California's supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer 2003, once 27
new power plants--15 of them licensed, 12 in the pipeline--start churning.
"It's not that we don't have long-term problems," said Stephen Levy,
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California
Economy. "It's just that energy isn't among them."
Others, including many environmentalists, say Bush could have made a
noticeable impact by, for example, beefing up energy efficiency programs--a
quick, clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand.
"Why not provide aggressive incentives [rebates] to get people to
purchase more efficient air conditioners?" asked Dan Reicher, assistant
Energy secretary in the Clinton administration. "Over the course of the year,
a program like that can make a dramatic difference" because air conditioning
consumes nearly one-third of California's peak energy supply.
Instead, Reicher noted, Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency
standards for air conditioners, a move that critics say will require the
country to build 43 new power plants.
Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California
were clouded by doubt.
Bush, for example, directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to
relieve a key transmission bottleneck, known as "Path 15," between Northern
and Southern California. But he specified that the upgrade, which requires
building a 90-mile line at an estimated cost of $225 million, be funded by
"nonfederal contributions"--meaning the financially strapped utilities might
be expected to bear the cost.
Gov. Davis, who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from
Washington, said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California and
criticized the president for allowing "the price-gouging energy companies,
many of which reside in Texas, to get away with murder."
Davis said the state is "doing everything possible to build and conserve
our way out of the problem," but it desperately needs federal price controls
on energy costs. In 1999, California energy users spent about $7 billion;
this year, even with consumption down 5%, the bill could top $50 billion.
But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the task force that
prepared the plan, are opposed to price caps, preferring to let market forces
reign.
Davis said that laissez faire approach puts California's economy in
peril.
"Just saying, over the long haul, everything will work out is turning a
blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state," Davis
said. "Small businesses . . . literally will go out of business because they
can't afford these rates."
Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly
disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California.
Bush recommends building 1,900 power plants over the next 20
years--about eight plants a month. But California is already on a
plant-building spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two years.
The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushing
for a renewed commitment to nuclear power. The California governor, however,
has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive
order issued in February.
There is little evidence, meanwhile, that Californians are eager to
approve an expansion in nuclear power. Nationwide, not one new nuclear plant
has been licensed in more than 20 years. And a Times Poll in February found
that 60% of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state.
"You can barely build clean-burning gas plants here, let alone nuclear
plants," said Edward Kahn, a San Francisco-based energy consultant with
Analysis Group/Economics.
Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a
proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines.
Currently, the U.S. government's power to forcibly acquire private property
applies only to highways and gas pipelines. Expanding that power is likely to
enrage property owners and property-rights advocates, who typically expect
backing from Bush-style conservatives.
"I'm just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the
state's [authority] over its own land," said Lynch of the PUC.
The issue is already heated in California. Communities in southwestern
Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas & Electric's attempts
to use eminent domain to obtain private land for 31 miles of transmission
lines. The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energy
officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for private
acreage.
Bush also proposed a unified, private national electricity grid, an idea
that seems at odds with Southern California Edison's effort to sell its
transmission lines to the state. But Edison officials said they hope to have
their deal worked out long before the president's idea comes to fruition--if
it ever does.
Unveiling his energy program in St. Paul, Minn., Bush said he is "deeply
concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of the good people
of the state of California."
But S. Davis Freeman, the former Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power chief who is now the governor's energy advisor, said Bush has let down
the state by failing to "answer the 911 call."
"It's like your house is on fire," Freeman said. "You call the fire
department, and they say, 'No, we're not coming, but we're building a
super-duper firetruck that will be ready five years from now.' "

Wall St. Cautious Over Energy Sector's Outlook for Next Year
Stocks: Earnings for many oil and natural gas producers are expected to top
out in 2001 as prices stabilize.

By JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO, Times Staff Writers

President Bush's energy plan, unveiled Thursday, helped spark a broad
rally across the energy sector and among firms that stand to benefit by
selling equipment and services to oil and natural gas companies.
Yet Wall Street has been taking a cautious stance toward energy shares
in recent months, and Thursday's rally doesn't change much, some analysts and
money managers say.
Despite the long-term earnings boost the sector could get under Bush's
plan, many oil and gas companies are expected to post lower earnings in 2002
than in 2001, analysts estimate.
That reflects expectations that crude oil and natural gas prices will at
best stabilize at current levels--which are down sharply from their 2000
peaks--or head lower.
Thus, after heady gains in 1999 and 2000 as oil and gas prices rocketed,
many energy stocks have stalled this year.
The American Stock Exchange index of 15 major natural-gas-related
stocks, for example, is down 4% year to date. The Standard & Poor's index of
six large oil and gas exploration and production companies has lost 5.3%.
Schlumberger (ticker symbol: SLB), a leading oil-field services company,
has seen its shares pull back 15% since Jan. 1, even with a gain of $1.78 to
$67.99 on Thursday.
By contrast, the blue-chip S&P 500 index is down 2.4% this year.
Craig T. Callahan, manager of Icon Energy stock mutual fund and chief
investment officer at the Icon Funds group, said investors need to be choosy
to find good buys today in the energy sector.
"We're leaning more toward the refiners than the drillers because
they're the better bargains," he said. "And at this point the good news looks
fully priced into the services and equipment group."
After betting big on the energy sector in early-1999, Callahan took
profits earlier this year. "We just don't see energy as a leader anymore--its
leadership days are done," he said.
Callahan shrugged off any potential windfalls from Bush's proposal. "We
look at these companies from the bottom up and pretty much ignore the macro
trends," he said.
For the near term, investors have to cope with the prospect that
earnings at many energy companies will decline in 2002.
Chevron (CHV), for example, is expected to earn $7.20 a share this year,
according to analysts' consensus estimate as tracked by IBES/Thomson
Financial. But next year the company's earnings are expected to fall to $6.20.
At the stock's current price--it rose 41 cents to $95.66 Thursday--the
price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated 2002 results is 15. That is lower
than the average blue-chip stock P/E of 21, but experts note that energy
stocks generally have lower P/Es because of the inherently cyclical nature of
the business.
Still, some analysts believe the Bush energy plan could revive interest
in many energy shares, if investors take a longer-term view.
Companies that explore for, produce and refine oil and gas could be
among the biggest beneficiaries of Bush's initiatives, said Corey McElveen,
stock analyst at Morningstar Inc. In particular, he cites Phillips Petroleum
(P) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which already have operations in energy-rich
Alaska. Phillips rose $1.72 to $65.87 on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil eased 77
cents to $88.73.
Callahan, however, favors companies that focus on refining. Ashland
(ASH), Pennzoil
