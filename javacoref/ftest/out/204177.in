Kevin Hyatt and I attended Sempra Energy Trading's weather derivatives
briefing in Houston last night, chaired by their chief meterologist, Dan
Guertin.  Dan's forecast for the winter of '00-01 seems to track pretty much
lockstep with the CPC's.  Dan also believes that this will be an
"oceanographic neutral" winter, with no El Nino or La Nina influences.  He
sees slightly above average temperatures for the western marketplace and a
relatively "normal" winter pattern (30 yr. avg.) for the mid-continent.
As far as monthly variations, he is predicting a cooler than usual November -
December, and a slightly warmer than usual pattern for the remainder of the
heating season.  He has promised to make his presentation information
available to the briefing attendees.  If I can secure a copy of it, I'll pass
it on.
