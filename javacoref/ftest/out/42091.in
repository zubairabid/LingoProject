i agree with kay's suggested approach.
if we are purchasing gas from another source at a higher price, i would put
dominion on notice that we are doing that and stating we will hold them
responsible.

Subject:     RE: Dominion gas supply Tallahassee
deal on Florida
I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree
with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking
him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.
We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination
is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.
Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since
they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.
