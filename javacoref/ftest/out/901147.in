I have a few thoughts that I think are important:
At the opening of the second paragraph, I would laud him for mandating RTOs for all generators.  That's not insignificant and I think its important to offer some praise with our very valid criticism.
I think we need to take the opportunity to point out that the "right" number of RTOs isn't simply an arbitrary number picked from a hat.  Right now, it seems to be, especially with Pat Wood suggesting last week that CA might not need to be in a west-wide RTO.  Now we're at 6 RTOs.  Do I hear 7?
Lastly, I believe the final paragraph is fraught will peril.  I feel strongly that telling a chairman, or any member of Congress, "this issue is too big and complicated and politicians will get it wrong" is a big mistake, though it's regrettably true in most cases, Dick Armey excepted.  In their view, and probably in the view of most Americans, they get paid to deal with big and complicated issues.
I believe we also set a dangerous precedent in saying "trust the regulators."  As you note, we're lucky that this FERC mostly gets it.  But the next FERC might not get it.  Nobody knows.
Our point, that Congress doesn't need to act, has to be made in a more ambiguous way.
The real answer: Don't trust politicians, or regulators.  Trust markets.  Repeal the Federal Power Act.
