Here is another hefty ISO  filing that came in this week.  Please let Sue or
I know if you believe we should intervene/protest.

Summary of ISO Amendment 34:

Filed: December 28

Effective Date: 1/1/01 (expedited treatment requested)

Protests Due: January 17? (need to confirm this)

Filing in a Nutshell: The ISO states that the purpose of the amendment is to
clarify certain issues associated with implementation of the new transmission
Access Charge methodology it orginally proposed in Amendment No. 27.
(According to the ISO, Amendment 27 has been accepted for filing, suspended,
and set for hearing.  Settlement negotiations are ongoing.  (Is Enron a party
to these settlements?)) In addition, the ISO provides new transmission Access
Charge (TAC) rates that will be in effect if the Commission approves the City
of Vernon joining the ISO effective January 1, 2001 and the amount of Firm
Transmission Rights that will be given to Vernon in accordance with the ISO
Tariff.

Specific Proposed Changes

Clarification of Wheeling Access Charge Quantity

The ISO proposes that these provisions be clarified to specify that in the
determination of the Wheeling Access Charge, the proper calculation is to use
transmission facility ownership and Entitlements less all Encumbrances.
Encumbrances include transmission used to meet demands of existing
contracts.  This is how the ISO is currently calculating this charge and the
ISO appears to be using this filing to codify this method.

New HV TAC Rates Using Year-1 of the ISO,s Proposed Transmission Methodology

The current Access Charge methodology consists of three separate zone rates
based on the Transmission Revenue Requirement of the Original Participating
TO.  Because each zone corresponds to the service territory of the TO, they
are known as &license plate8 rates.  Under Amendment No. 27, this methodology
continues in effect until a New Participating TO joins the ISO.  Once that
occurs, the Access Charge for High Voltage Transmission Facilities will be
assessed based on the combined High Voltage Transmission Revenue Requirements
of all the Participating TOs in each TAC Area.

The filing claims to implement an already-approved transition formula wherein
new members of the ISO will pay a rate that is a mix license place and system
average embedded costs.  The goal is that after 10 years there will be only 1
high voltage access charge. The following table shows that under the current
method, which would be a 90/10 split of license-plate/system-average charges,
PG&E and SCE TO access charges would rise approximately $3.2 million and
Vernon would be subsidized approximately $7 million.

Calculation of the net (benefits)/burdens from Access Charge and GMC Impact.
PG&E and SCE have a $32 Million cap annually and
SDG&E has a $8 Million cap annually; Vernon is held harmless; I
OUs pay muni cost increases in proportion to their cap relative to the total
cap.	Adjusted
Net
(Benefit)/
Burden
($1000)
[37]
PG&E	$3,283
SCE	$3,283
SDG&E	$821
Vernon	($7,051)
Total	$336


Note: a positive number means the TAC is going up.  A negative number means
the TAC is going down (or will be lower than would be the case under 100%
license plate ratemaking)


Vernon,s Existing Transmission Rights Converted to FTRs

Veron, by joining the ISO effective 1/1/01, agrees to convert existing
transmission rights to FTRs of presumably an equivalent amount.  The proposed
FTRs to allocate to Vernon are in the filing.  These FTRs will expire when
the underlying contract right expires or 10 years, whichever is sooner.
