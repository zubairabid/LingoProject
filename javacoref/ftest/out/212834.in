House Passes H-1B Visas; Bill Now Awaits Clinton's Signature
In a strangely abrupt end to the protracted and often rocky debate on H-1B
visa increase legislation, the House late Tuesday approved a Senate-passed
bill by voice vote, and sent the measure to the White House for President
Clinton's signature.
The bill is largely designed to increase the number of skilled foreign
workers who can be hired by high technology companies, and Clinton has
pledged to sign it.
House Republican leaders made the decision late Tuesday to bring the H-1B
visa increase legislation up for debate and vote under a suspension of the
rules, just hours after the Senate had approved the identical legislation in
a 96-1 vote. House leadership made the call after most members already had
left for the day--a move that invited criticism from some Democratic
legislators who complained about being caught off guard.
Democratic leaders were informed about an hour beforehand that floor debate
on the measure would begin. After a brief debate, the bill was approved by
voice vote--even though House Republican leaders had initially said that they
intended to bring the measure for a roll call vote today. The decision to
press forward was reached amid a House Republican leadership meeting, and a
second private meeting held among Majority Leader Armey, Rules Chairman
Dreier and Judiciary Immigration Subcommittee Chairman Lamar Smith, R-Texas.
"I don't think there was much talk, if any, across the aisle," said one high
tech lobbyist. "I think they [Republicans] felt they had to strike while the
iron was hot." This lobbyist also noted that key House Democrats--including
Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif.--had signaled early in the day that they were
amenable to taking up the Senate-passed bill, which is similar to H-1B
legislation sponsored by Dreier and Lofgren.
A spokeswoman to Minority Leader Gephardt expressed disappointment in the
short notice Democrats were given, calling it an "infantile" way to
legislate. "Let us know what the schedule is, that's common courtesy," she
said.
Smith was likewise displeased, although for different reasons. The Senate
bill differs sharply from Smith's own version of the legislation, which was
reported out of committee earlier this year. In his floor statement, Smith
congratulated Dreier, but insisted there was "no credible study" showing a
shortage of skilled American workers to fill the high tech jobs.
Said a Smith aide: "Time ...has overtaken [efforts] to produce a balanced
bill."
Lofgren, who said she had to be summoned back to Capitol Hill for Tuesday's
debate, called the Senate legislation "a very good bill that should become
law. I'm glad I was able to get into the carpool lane and get here in time to
talk about why this bill deserves our support," she joked.
Dreier acknowledged that debate on the bill had taken the two parties down a
"bumpy" road, but said he was pleased at the bipartisan outcome.
House Republican leaders had been hesitant to bring the H-1B legislation up
earlier this year, out of concerns that Democrats would use it as a platform
from which to attack Republicans on their immigration stances--those relating
to Latinos in particular.
But while Democrats such as Lofgren and Judiciary ranking member John
Conyers, D-Mich., indicated they would continue to press for a package of
Hispanic immigration provisions backed by the White House, they did not dwell
on the subject.
Democrats were more vocal with their concerns that the Senate bill could not
include a revenue raising device included in the Dreier-Lofgren bill, which
doubled the fee that employers will have to pay to hire an H-1B visa worker.
Under the House bill, that money would go for education programs to ensure
that American workers earn the skills needed to fill these high tech jobs in
the future. Rather than amend the Senate bill, however, Dreier introduced a
stand alone bill designed to adjust the fee. The H-1B measure raises the visa
caps to 195,000 per year through FY2003.
