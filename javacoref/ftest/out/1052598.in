ATTENTION CGC INTERRUPTIBLE CUSTOMERS AND THEIR SHIPPERS:
Effective at 10 AM, Monday, November 20, 2000 and until further notice,
Chattanooga Gas Company (CGC)  is issuing a curtailment order for all
interruptible customers.  The interruptible customers are limited to their
scheduled gas from the interstate pipelines plus any firm contract amounts
with CGC.   No other CGC gas is available for interruptible sales at this

or emergency gas).

Since this is the first curtailment of the season, please make every effort
to ensure your alternative fuel systems are fully operational before the
effective time of the curtailment (10 AM, Monday, November 20, 2000).

Earl Burton will be contacting the interruptible customers this afternoon or
in the morning tomorrow to notify them of this curtailment.

If you have any questions regarding this curtailment, please contact Earl
