There are two fields of gas that I am having difficulty with in the Unify
System.

1. Cage Ranch - Since there is no processing agreement that accomodates this
gas on King Ranch, it is my understanding  HPL is selling the liquids and
King Ranch is re-delivering to stratton.  It is also my understanding that
there is a .05 cent fee
to deliver this gas.  We need a method to accomodate the volume flow on HPL
at meter 415 and 9643.  This gas
will not be reflected on Trans. Usage ticket #123395 and #95394 since it is
not being nominated from a   processing agreement.  We either, need to input
a point nom (on HPL or KRGP) at these meters to match the nom at meter  9610,
or a deal for Purchase and Sale (if King Ranch is taking title to the gas)
needs to be input into Sitara at these meters  with the  appropriate rate.  I
have currently input a point nom on KRGP to accomodate this flow, so we can
divert some of this gas to the current interstate sales that are being made.

2. Forest Oil -   There is a processing agreement that will accomodate flow
from the meter (6396) into King Ranch.  It is my
understanding that this agreement was originally setup until Texaco had
their own processing agreement.  I need   confirmation that the gas from this
meter should be nominated on contract # (96006681) and that this agreement
should  have been reassigned to HPLC. (It is currently still under HPLR).

If this gas is not nominated on the above transport agreement, then once
again we need to accomodate the flow volume  on the HPL pipe with either a
point nom or a Sitara Deal at meters 415 and 9643.
