Briefly:

The hearing that was planned to focus on UC issues has been postponed, although per the attached there will be a discussion concerning the impact of Energy Service Providers turning their customers back to DWR/utility service.


Also, the Federal Judge has scheduled the UC/CSU - Enron Energy Services hearing for April 11th.  UC had requested an immediate review versus a procedural 35 days to schedule.  The schedule reflects a more procedural answer.
