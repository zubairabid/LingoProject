The attached e-mail was sent to the Venable Law Group, who is representing Verizon, expressing the lack of interest by Enron in joining Venable's coalition.  The coalition was intended to be used by Venable to demonstrate support for Verizon's legislative agenda, which, in short, is that access to and pricing of fiber will be on an unregulated basis, outside of FCC or state jurisdiction.  This is another short-hand way of getting back to Tauzin-Dingel language.  We told Venable we weren't interested.

I spoke w/ Rich DiMichele about the possibility of using Verizon's interest in our coalition support to negotiate something commercially for Enron.  He expressed the sentiment contained in the e-mail:  Verizon has done nothing for us.  Why should we do something for them?

Venable has come back with a request for a meeting between their senior executives and ours.

Before I go back to the business people with Venable's offer, I thought we should discuss, possibly on Tuesday.
