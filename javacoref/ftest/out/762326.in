Two elderly gentlemen, who had been without sex
for several years, decided they needed to visit a
cat-house for some tail..... When they arrived, the
madam took one look at them and decided she wasn't
going to waste any of her girls on these two
old men.

So she used "blow-up" dolls instead. She put the
dolls in each man's room and left them to their
business. After the two men were finished, they
started walking home and began to talking. The
first man said, "I think the girl I had was dead.
She never moved, talked or even groaned... how
was it for you?"

The second man replied, "I think mine was a witch.
When I nibbled on her breast..... she farted and
flew out the window!"
