Doug,
I will bring this issue up with EGAS management - - will revert with their feedback on this internal accounting transfer (i.e., no new cash to Enron) as well as the trasnfer of associated interest gonig forward, etc.  We need to consider the potential effect to Enron of this internal transfer from the perspective of legal strategies as well as current restructuring efforts with the lenders.
On another matter: have not heard from you regarding the Venezuela trading assistance (from Vengas).
