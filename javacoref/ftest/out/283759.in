Anne, David will take the lead and work with Tom Martin on obtaining the appropriate index pricing and work with the confirmation  desk to prepare a GTC with ENA as Seller and HPL as buyer to cause HPL to have the same economic transaction as if this transaction had been swapped back to index.  BNG

It is my understanding from a discussion we had with Tom and David that the EEX contract, which is a fixed price deal with ENA, is not going to HPL. and should not be listed on Schedule 4.13 (v).  Instead, ENA will sell to HPL the EEX gas at index.  There needs to be a contract put into place that reflects the sale from ENA to HPL and that contract will be listed on Schedule 4.13 (v).  We have agreed to provide AEP with the amended and updated schedules on Monday the 15th, so we should go ahead and get this documented now.   Barbara--who typically puts together gas purchase agreements like this?   Please call if you have any questions.

Sandi,
Attached is an excel spreadsheet which serves to update Schedule 4.13 (v) to the AEP Agreement covering Material Contracts.  The list reflects information in Enron's Global Contract System as of April 30, 2001 and covers business which will be conducted after June 1, 2001.  We direct your attention to Column AB of the spreadsheet:  those contracts which were included on the April 2000 6th Revision of Schedule 4.13 (v) are noted by their numerical designation in that Schedule; those contracts which cover deals traded subsequent to 3/15/2001 (the cutoff for the earlier Schedule) are so noted; and, those deals which were considered during our prior reviews but excluded from the final April 2000 6th Revision of the Schedule for various reasons are so noted with an explanation in the Comments Column, AC.
The April 2000 6th Revision cites 3 purchase contracts with Forrest Oil Corporation; while we included 96007597 and 96048499 on the spreadsheet attached, we could find no justification for also including 96049286 on the list.  You may have other information which supports including 96049286 on the schedule
The attached excel spreadsheet includes the EEX E&P Company, L.P. fixed price contract, 96054930, done by the Enron Finance Group for 4/2001 thru 12/2004.
