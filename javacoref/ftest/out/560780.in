This is a request for your interview participation.  The Associate and
Analyst Programs will be on the Harvard, MBA campus interviewing summer
ASSOCIATE interns next week.  Due to business reasons, previously scheduled
interviewers from the Harvard team have had to cancel their participation or
couldn't schedule participation.

Currently, I need additional interviewers for Tuesday, February 6th and an
interviewer for Wednesday, February 7th.  These trips would require an
arrival the night before.  Please let me know of your availability.  Campus
interviews are scheduled as follows:

Place:  Harvard School of Business
The Charles Hotel

Date:  Tuesday, February 6th  Wednesday, January 30
Day One Interviews    Day Two Interviews
Time:  8:30 a.m. -    8:30 a.m.-

Please contact me for further details.

In the event that you have scheduling conflicts and cannot participate, any
referrals at the Director or VP level would be greatly appreciated.

As always, thank you for your time and please contact me @ ext5-7588 if you
have any questions.
