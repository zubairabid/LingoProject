Tom/Bill

Attached hereto, is the response letter to Duke Energy Merchants, LLC relating to their demand for adequate assurances of performance from ELFI, EGLI, ECT and ENA.

I have copied Elizabeth Sager on this e-mail, as there may be a similar letter that has been sent to EPMI, though I have not seen a copy of this letter.  In the event that there is such a request outstanding the entity may be added to the letter already prepared.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Please note that the "bcc" list should not be sent with the final copy of the letter to Duke.

John
