El Paso said the Waha Station's Solar turbines will be unavailable Dec. 18,
which will limit deliveries at six Waha interconnects to 600 MMcf/d. Receipts
from 12 interconnects will be limited to a total of 380 MMcf/d if their
pressure is below 900 psig. Any of the affected points that can deliver to
EPNG at pressures up to 1,000 psig will be able to flow normally scheduled
volumes. The work is being scheduled now because current market demands have
not required operation of the Solar turbines, El Paso said.
