Hi everyone,
Attached is the list of all packets ending October 2001.  There are several shippers that are getting cut for today's gas day, which makes their cumulative balance be off the target volume month to date.  The following are the shippers who are off target as of the 18th of October:

Duke
ENA
MidAmerica
NSP Power Pack  (the Power Pack ends in October and should have a zero balance at month end, any residual balance will be transferred to Park and Ride)
Tenaska
Transcanada
Virginia Power

Thank you for working with your shippers in getting their packets to balance.
