Lorna,
Sources close to Kern River confirmed with me just yesterday that the
original expansion (124,500 MMBtu/d) is being contracted principally by one
party, PG&E National Energy Group, for their La Paloma Power Project outside
of Bakersfield, California.  I'm assuming that additional support for a 2nd
KRGT expansion will come from other developers interested in securing gas
supply.

It's important to remember the economics here --- Kern River's pipeline
originates in Wyoming (Rockies gas) and delivers directly into Southern
California.  Their gas generally clears the market at the Southern California
Border index.  Consequently, there is no stacking of rates as would be the
case if TW or EPNG attempted to deliver their gas through Mojave to the same
markets.  I've attached the recent press release regarding the La Paloma
project for your information...


PG&E CORPORATION UNIT BEGINS CONSTRUCTION OF
CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST +GREENFIELD, MERCHANT POWER PLANT
La Paloma Facility Will Fill a Critical Need for New Electricity Supplies in
California

San Francisco ) Welcoming the opportunity to provide competitive electricity
to meet the growing electricity needs of California, PG&E Corporation
(NYSE:PCG) announced today that its National Energy Group has begun
construction on the La Paloma Generating Plant. La Paloma is a 1,048-megawatt
, natural gas-fueled combined-cycle facility. The plant is expected to begin
operating in the summer of 2001.  PG&E National Energy Group President & CEO
Tom Boren said, "The construction of the La Paloma facility is an important
step in meeting the growing demand for electricity in the state. We welcome
the opportunity to further the growth of customer choice in California's
evolving competitive power market."

The California Independent System Operator (ISO), a non-profit public benefit
corporation responsible for maintaining transmission reliability and ensuring
adequate electricity supplies, hailed La Paloma as a welcome addition. "As
North America,s only regional transmission operator relying on competitive
market forces to maintain the critical balance between electricity supply and
demand for California,s 27 million electric customers, the California ISO is
very pleased that PG&E,s National Energy Group has stepped forward with the
La Paloma facility to fill an essential consumer need," said Cal ISO
President & CEO Terry Winter. "This investment shows that the market is
responding to the growing demand for electricity."
"As a highly efficient plant from both an energy and environmental
standpoint, California consumers will benefit," added PG&E Corp.'s Boren.
"The La Paloma Generating Plant provides highly competitive costs with a
minimum of energy consumption and environmental impacts."

The La Paloma plant site is approximately 40 miles west of Bakersfield,
Calif. in western Kern County on an industrial site previously used for oil
production. When completed, it will be the state,s largest facility designed
from the ground up exclusively as a merchant power plant. A merchant plant
sells its electrical output to wholesale customers in a regional competitive
bulk power market. Those wholesale customers, which include traditional
utilities, municipal utility districts, retail energy services companies,
wholesale power marketers, and electric cooperatives, in turn arrange to have
the electricity delivered to retail consumers.

The La Paloma development team has selected ABB ALSTOM POWER Inc. as the
turnkey contractor for the project. ABB ALSTOM POWER is responsible for the
design and engineering work, the procurement of equipment and management of
sub-contractors, and the actual construction of the facility. The La Paloma
Generating Project received its California Energy Commission approval in
October 1999, and the financing package for the project is being completed
now.

"The rigorous permitting process really laid the ground for an outstanding
construction program," said Roger Garratt, project development manager for
PG&E Corporation,s generating unit. "We look forward to making a major
contribution to the Kern County economy in a manner that is completely
compatible with the area's sensitive ecosystem." Garratt noted the project's
plan to permanently set aside conservation land as part of its environmental
mitigation program.
