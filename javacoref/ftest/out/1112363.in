Yesterday's (Tues) Electric Power Daily reports that EEI has assembled a task force of industry executives to assess their systems after last week's tragedy and to report on legislative changes that may be necessary to promote the reliability of the grid.  There is also a report on the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Consortium that is doing some study.  That spokesperson says that deregulation brings lower reliability due to reduction in operating margins.  I don't know if Enron was asked to participate in either of these, but the results, if solely based on input of those that don't want deregulation, could certainly be used to slow things down.
