Item 3.
I've updated page 2 of the attached to illustrate pricing that was presented
to Brazos and its advisor (Merril Lynch) during the period of time leading up
to the PPA's signing on November 1, 1993.  You'll see that actual results to
date have been in line with were costs were expected to be under the contract.
We have a one page document that appears to be part of a larger Brazos
document that indicates that Brazos looked at 10 competing alternatives to
the Tenaska IV plant (including one Enron alternative).  The document is
date-stamped December 28, 1993 and may be part of an "integrated resource
plan" or another regulatory filing required in the State of Texas.  Robin
Kittel in our Austin, TX office is looking into its source and is trying to
find any other regulatory filings in which Brazos represented that it viewed
Tenaska IV as its "least cost alternative" at the point in time it entered
into the contract.  I don't expect we'll have this information prior to
Friday.
These points aside, there is nothing in the contract that ties pricing or
performance to returns realized by Tenaska IV.  The issue of "fairness" is
one that Brazos seems to be emotionally attached to without basis under the
contract.
One item to note in the "fraudulent inducement" arena, the last commercial
exchanges made between Tenaska IV and Brazos prior to the June 30 transaction
indicate that Brazos may have raised some concerns over "incentives" that may
have been provided to the Brazos staff closest to the transaction.  After
discussions with Tenaska, Inc. and review of the facilitation material, we've
identified the source of these concerns to be a dove hunting trip that was
planned during the summer of 1993 and taken November 9 through 11, 1993, just
after the PPA's signing.  The point person for Brazos and Tenaska's CEO, lead
developer and another Tenaska employee took the trip with their spouses.
