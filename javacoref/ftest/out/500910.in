ERCOT System Planning has prepared calculations
and data to support the identification of
Commercially Significant Constraints (CSC). A
meeting to discuss these calculations with
stakeholders will be held:
Wednesday, January 31
9:30 AM to 3:30 PM
Red Lion Hotel in Austin (I35 & 290)
The goal of this meeting is to identify which
transmission system contingencies and limiting
elements are commercially significant.  After
CSC's are determined at this meeting, ERCOT will
develop a recommendation and present it to TAC at
their February 7 meeting.
We have also set up an email account to receive
comments.  Its email address is
csccomments@ercot.com
it will be available throughout this process to
receive comments and input.
