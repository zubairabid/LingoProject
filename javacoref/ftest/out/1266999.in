MEET ME IN THE STAIRWELL

You say you will never forget where you were when you heard the
news on September 11, 2001. Neither will I.

I was on the 110th floor in a smoke filled room with a man who
called   his wife to say "Good-Bye." I held his fingers steady as he
dialed.

I gave him the peace to say, "Honey, I am not going to make it,
but  it  is OK...I am ready to go."

I was with his wife when he called as she fed breakfast to their
children. I held her up as she tried to understand his words and
as  she realized he wasn't coming home that night.

I was in the stairwell of the 23rd floor when a woman cried out to
Me  for help. "I have been knocking on the door of your heart for 50
years!" I said. "Of course I will show you the way home -- only
believe in Me now."

I was at the base of the building with the Priest ministering to
the  injured and devastated souls. I took him home to tend to his Flock
in  Heaven. He heard my voice and answered.

I was on all four of those planes, in every seat, with every
prayer.   I was with the crew as they were overtaken. I was in the very
hearts  of the believers there, comforting and assuring them that their
faith   has saved them.

I was in Texas, Kansas, London. I was standing next to you when
you  heard the terrible news. Did you sense Me?

I want you to know that I saw every face. I knew every name --
though not all know Me. Some met Me for the first time on the 86th floor.

Some sought Me with their last breath.
Some couldn't hear Me calling to them through the smoke and
flames;

"Come to Me...this way...take my hand." Some chose, for the final
time, to ignore Me. But, I was there.

I did not place you in the Tower that day. You may not know why,
but   I do. However, If you were there in that explosive moment in time,
would you have reached for Me?

September 11, 2001, was not the end of the journey for you. But
someday your journey will end. And I will be there for you as
well.   Seek Me now while I may be found. Then, at any moment, you know
you  are "ready to go."

I will be in the stairwell of your final moments.

God

OUR FATHER

During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are doing, and take
this
opportunity. (Literally it is only 1 minute)

All you have to do is the following:

You simply say and "Our Father" for the person that sent you this
message:

Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom
Come,
Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day
our
daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us
from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
forever
and ever AMEN.

Next, you send this message to everyone you know. In a while, more
people will have prayed for you and you will have obtained a lot
of
people praying for others.

Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life, for
doing what you know is pleasing to Him. If you are not ashamed to
do
this, follow the instructions.

Jesus said, "If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you
before
My Father."

If you are not ashamed, send this message ... only if you believe.

"Yes, I love my God. He is my fountain of Life and My Savior. He
keeps me going day and night. Without Him, I am no one. But with
Him, I can do everything. Christ is my strength."

This is a simple test. If you love God and you are not ashamed of
all
the great things that he has done for you, send this to everyone
you
know, and the person that sent it to you.

AMEN, and God Bless Us All.....
