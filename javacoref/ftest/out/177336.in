Upon research, it was discovered that this customer has two active meters in
two different Utilities (PG&E, and SOCAL) under the same contract.  This is
the reason for the confusion.  For tracking purposes, we "break-out" meters
by LDC in order to assign our customers to reps familiar with a particular
LDC. Those customers that have multiple LDC's under the same contract are
assigned to the same rep.  This allows the customers to speak to the same
individual for all of their accounts.
Unfortunately the site in question was identified in error as a single site
only.  The site in PG&E was assigned to Dennis Harris, while the site in
SOCAL, because of the low usage, was identified for transition to SOCAL.
This was not our intention.  The data has been realigned and Dennis Harris
now has access to both records.
I spoke to Dennis regarding this issue, and he will contact the customer,
explain why it occurred, stop the transition to SOCAL for this site, should
the customer choose to; as well as coordinate a renewal for this customer
going forward, as their current agreement is to expire 05/31/01.
