Timing is everything.  Today I spoke to DB about the ETA amendment.  Unfortunately, many of their workers remain quite shaken by the Sept. events as their office is farily close to ground zero.
We have one issue outstanding.  I have provided language to their counsel that I believe will satisfy their concerns.  I am not waiting for an approval of that language.  Presuming it comes this week, we should be done.
Please let me know if any of you should have any further questions.
Thanks.
