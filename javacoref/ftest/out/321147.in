Steve,
Merchant Energy Ventures doesn't have auditable financials, but NorthWestern
Corporation will give GE a corporate guaranty for MEV. Let me know if you run
into difficulty verifying their financial status, as I'm sure we can get you
something. In addition, Enron North America will have the responsibility to
make the future payments to GE as these payment obligations exist as of the
closing.
