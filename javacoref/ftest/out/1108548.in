Richard and Lamar:

Fetzer e-mailed me recently and wants to begin discussions on
extending their fixed price renewable power deal with us.

Their current fixed price expires in 5/02 with and index price going
out to 2009.

If this is below your radar, Lamar I would be happy to work it with
the customer and Richard on the renewable energy side.
