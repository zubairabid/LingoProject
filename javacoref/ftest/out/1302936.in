FYI

We are looking into whether this is a federal or state settlement.  More analysis shortly.

North Carolina: A compromise is expected to be unveiled today that would cut in half the $2 billion cost of combating pollution from the state's 14 coal-fired power plants.

Under the compromise, Duke Power and Carolina Power and Light would be committed to decreasing their sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emissions by approximately two-thirds by 2007.

An additional requirement to decrease sulfur dioxide by about another 50 percent by 2013 could be canceled by the state Department of Environment and Natural Resources, and negotiators found the $1 billion in savings by not counting this phase of pollution cuts.
