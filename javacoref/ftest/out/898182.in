Michelle / David:
Frank Stabler called to determine the status of his separation agreement amendment.  Bernadette Etienne, in Mary Joyce's Office, called to say that she received the amendment signed by Frank in their office and wanted to know what to do with it.  Should this document go to the Cash Mgmt Committee for authorization to execute?
