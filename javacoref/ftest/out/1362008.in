Rich, Thanks for your response. Sorry for the long e-mail. I did not expect
to be this long but it kept getting longer and longer while I wrote it. We
can set up a meeting to discuss about it instead of reading this long e-mail.

You know, any individual product has two risk components---unique risk and
market risk. Most products in energy industry have very high market risk and
very low unique risk. (For example, a price of gas produced from Texas is
highly correlated with the Henry Hub spot price.) Since the market risk plays
an important role in the energy commodities' prices, people buy and sell
commodities or their derivatives mainly for "hedging" purpose---to reduce
their market risk.

However, the movie market is quite different than other commodity markets.
The Gross Box Office receipt of "The Little Mermaid" has low correlation with
the sum of Gross Box Office receipts of all movies releasing at the same
period. An individual movie has very high unique risk and very low market
risk. If you remember, the consultant last Friday said that if we own about
15 movies, their combined total revenue would be pretty much accurately
forecasted. That means movies' market risk is low and "hedging" is not
important comparing to "diversification".

Since the unique risk plays an important role in the movie market, I would
expect that most of our customers would buy and sell for "diversification"
purpose, not for "hedging" purpose. The producer of some movies would sells
part of their movies and buy part of the other movies to diversify their
unique risk.

I think we are going into the right direction by creating this movie market
so people who long on a small set of movies can sell part of them and buy
some parts of other movies. The buyers and sellers in this market can all
just be the people who naturally long on some slates of movies. They will
sell some of their own and buy some of others.

I think the idea on grouping a small number of movies to increase liquidity
is good but we need to make sure that diversification can still be done
through this market.

If Enron wants to take some position, I would recommend that we must be
diversified enough (15+ movies as the consultant said). We should avoid
taking a position on a small number of movies. Otherwise, we will be just an
"inefficient" gambler. (Like putting all the money into only one or two
stocks. We could have made the same expected return with a lot less risk by
investing in S&P500.)

For your questions about the bid-ask pricing system that I proposed in the
previous e-mail, if there are no buyers, the tentative bid-ask prices would
be very low. So we tell the seller to reduce their selling price to this
level if they still want to sell to us. (We can set our bid price to be low
enough by subtracting its unique risk premium---insurance premium--so now we
can take this position and behave like an insurance company. But we need to
have (or expected to have) a significant numbers of similar deals of other
movies.)

I agree that leaving open orders for several days might be a problem. We can
set the "bidding period" to be just only 1 day (e.g. every Monday) and
everything is cleared at the end of the day.

I have not seen other markets using this dynamic bid-ask pricing system and
the idea was just came up by myself, so I believe it is new. I plan to write
a memo explaining the details of this system and send it to you.

Dear everyone, please correct me if I am wrong.
Thanks,
