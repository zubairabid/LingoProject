Rob,
After reviewing both Lauren's and Jeff's comments, I have little to add.  I
would, however, replace the last part of Jeff's sentence in the first
paragraph with "and there is a need to take a comprehensive look at
strategies for reducing CO2  emissions more broadly, in ways that make
economic and environmental sense" to avoid mentioning the Kyoto Protocol
directly.
And, I'd like to reiterate Lauren's suggestion that the article should direct
employees to our climate change policy statement in last year's EHS Report
and that Lay encourages them to research and reflect on the issue and
communicate their thoughts.
Thanks,
Catherine
