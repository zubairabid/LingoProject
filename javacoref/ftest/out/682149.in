So far only 6 of us (that would include me) have paid their final cash
call to Port O'Connor Country Club, L.P.   Deer is waiting patiently for
a significant amount of money, and he has subcontractors that are very
anxious.  The final cash calls were mailed to you back on October 4th
and are due NOW.  If you didn't get your big package from my office
containing all your condo closing documents and a separate envelope
marked "FINAL CASH CALL", please (i) check with your partner, since I
only sent out one package per unit; (ii) go check your mailbox again;
(iii) talk to your wife; and (iv) once you have done all that, call me
and I'll try to fix you up with another set.
If you have any questions regarding the cash call after reading your
package thoroughly, give me a call.  Thank you all for your very prompt
attention to this matter.
