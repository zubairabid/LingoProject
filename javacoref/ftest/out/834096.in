Donald,

Back in October we had the gas received by HPL at the above meter moved to
Strangers Gas pending a call from Coastal to renegotiate a contract for Sept
2000 gas.  Since volumes can no longer be allocated to stranger,s gas it has
been placed on an MJG deal which was the only valid deal available for Sept
2000.
I assume Coastal has not contacted Brian as of yet.  Is it possible to have a
deal created for Coastal with a price of zero?  I know that we definitely do
not want to pay MJG for this gas, but as long as the volume is sitting on
their deal there is a possibility that someone may inadvertently send the
payment out.  Let me know what you think.

Thanks,
Nick
