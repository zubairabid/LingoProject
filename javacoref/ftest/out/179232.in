Jeff is correct that AB 1890 said NOTHING about direct access credits, said
nothing about whether such credits were to be market based, or whether
direct access customers were to be indifferent to their choice of power
providers.  All of the direct access credit rules were developed by the CPUC
in their approval of the direct access tariff rules (Rule 22) and in their
implementation of the utility cost recovery plans (the calculation of CTC).
Therefore, we cannot protest the PE advice letter on that basis.  We can
still argue for the DJ indexes as a more appropriate substitute for a PE
credit based just on Edison's cost of generation (retained generation plus
QFs plus DWR purchases) but we have to recognize that it the number is
higher than the PE credit, we will be effectively asking for a subsidy to
direct access providers from the utility's bundled customers.  I do not
expect us to succeed in obtaining that subsidy.  The bottom up tariff
structure is a much more likely result at this point.  Mike Day
