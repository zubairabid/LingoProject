I spoke with Beth Ng (who is not a lawyer!).  Beth would like for Enron Gas Liquids Inc. and ERAC to sign the "mini-netting" agreements she has already negotiated with EEFT through Paul Simons.  Morgan does not need to execute this "mini-netting" agreement with ENA.  Morgan would be interested, however, in seeing the ENA form of Master Netting Agreement which they may also agree to sign.  But for the immediate future, the EEFT version is their primary goal.

ENA will execute an assignment with ELFI and Morgan to accept ELFI's positions in the four financial trades.

Hope this helps.
