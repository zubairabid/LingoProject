Following up on yesterday's conference call, SBX 32 (Alpert) will be
heard by the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday.  The current bill
language will be amended to specify that direct access customers in the
SDG&E territory, will only be liable for the undercollection incurred
for energy purchases on their behalf, either by DWR or SDG&E, not while
they were receiving energy from an ESP.  UCAN may try to amend the bill
to make ESPs liable for the undercollection, but according to Senator
Bowen's consultant, this is a "non-starter."
