Protect Religious Liberty: Oppose President  Bush's Faith-Based Initiative



Despite repeated controversies and reports that  President Bush's faith-based
initiative has lost its momentum, the full  House of Representatives is
expected to vote as early as Wednesday on  legislation that would implement
the President's fundamentally flawed  plan.

The legislation, (H.R. 7,), the "Community Solutions Act," includes
provisions that sharply attack one of the oldest civil rights principles  --
that tax dollars not fund discrimination. Because the proposal removes
restrictions on how religious organizations incorporate their beliefs into
the delivery of social services, discrimination would be permitted in  hiring
decisions and in the delivery of services.

The President has repeatedly claimed that the bill would include  sizable tax
incentives for charitable giving and new funding for social  service
programs, both are absent from the bill that will be voted on-only  the
government-funded religion provisions remain. Further, the legislation  now
includes a provision that allows Cabinet Secretaries to turn any  social
service program into a voucher program. This unprecedented move  would allow
longstanding grant programs to be converted to voucher  programs without
Congressional approval and would remove legal barriers  that now stop
religious organizations from proselytizing beneficiaries.

The Bush faith-based initiative would obliterate any distinction  between
religious institutions that would follow the rules and not use  public money
to proselytize and those that would gladly violate the  nation's fundamental
principles.

Oppose this legislation now!

[IMAGE] H.R. 7 provides no new funds for social services programs.  The
President has repeatedly stated that his faith-based initiative  would
provide new money for social service programs as well as tax  incentives to
encourage charitable giving. This legislation provides no  new money and only
makes it easier for religious groups to proselytize and  discriminate with
tax dollars.

[IMAGE]The Bush initiative would allow for taxpayer-funded  discrimination.
Religion is a very personal belief that varies from  individual to
individual. We need to protect each person's religious  freedom, including
the freedom to receive services without being forced to  listen to another's
religious beliefs. Under the Bush proposal, there  would be no restrictions
on how religious organizations incorporate their  beliefs into the delivery
of social services. Further, religious  organizations would be allowed to be
discriminate against applicants for  jobs with federally funded on the basis
of religion, marital status,  sexual orientation, gender, HIV status, or any
other characteristic that a  religious organization find objectionable.

[IMAGE]Government should not get into the business of  religion.This proposal
would expose religious institutions to invasive  government regulation,
including compliance reviews and audits. We must  not put government in the
position of regulating religion.

[IMAGE]H.R 7 would fund proselytization. This legislation  includes a
provision that allows any Cabinet Secretary to convert existing  social
service programs into voucher programs. As a result, the voucher  provision
removes the legal barriers that now stop religious organizations  from
proselytizing beneficiaries.
