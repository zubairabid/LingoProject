Below is language from EPA guidance that confirms that only liquid samples
are required for characterization purposes.  Sue

Q: Under o761.30(i), is use of organic liquids for characterization of the
natural gas
pipeline system required?
A: Yes. EPA,s intention was for organic liquids to be used to characterize
the PCB
contamination in the natural gas pipeline system. EPA will make a technical
correction to
o761.30(i)(4) to clarify this.

Q: When conducting the annual sampling under o761.30(i), what do you do if
you don,t
have liquids present annually?
A: Under the use authorization provisions at o761.30(i), if a pipeline system
once contained
liquids at 50 ppm or greater but is now relatively dry (i.e., there are no
liquids available to
test at existing condensate collection points), then the owner/operator of
the pipeline
system has no further sampling and analysis to do until such time as liquids
appear. EPA
did not intend to require wipe sampling for characterizing natural gas
pipeline systems in
use; hence, EPA has made a technical correction at o761.30(i)(4) to drop the
reference to
wipe samples.  For these relatively  dry systems with no liquids, the
sampling requirements at
o761.30(i)(1)(iii)(A)(5) don,t apply. However, EPA would expect the
owner/operator of
the pipeline system to continue to check at least annually for liquids and
document their
absence under the recordkeeping requirements in o761.30(i)(1)(iii)(C). Should
any liquids
appear later, the liquids should be tested.
