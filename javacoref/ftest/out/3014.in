The attached details a two tiered sale to AGC, of which the second component needs an immediate Confirmation and executable EEI Master for AGC's signature.  AGC is expecting the EEI today, their consultant has already reviewed a "blank" EEI and with no credit provisions this should not be a problem.   If anyone has any questions please contact me ASAP.
