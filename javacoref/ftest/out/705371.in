Rich, I agree with  your concern.  The entire Arizona mainline is a potential
concern for carrying PCB's into California.  We have verification of this
from the last cleaning we did on the San Juan lateral where liquids got past
the Gallup C/S scrubbers and PG&E and SoCal both reported elevated liquids in
their systems. Analytical results of these liquids in California showed PCB's
at regulated levels (ie greater than 50 ppm).
