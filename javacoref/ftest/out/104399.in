Hi girls!  Just wanted everyone to check their
calendars for some upcoming events.  Madeline's
baptism is going to be Saturday, April 6th during the
5:30pm mass.  We plan on having a little celebration
at our house afterwards.  If you can't make it, we
understand, but we'd love to have you come.

We talked about doing Stacey's baby shower the next
weekend, April 13 at Kathy's house.  Does that date
still work for everyone?  Let us know soon so we can
start making plans.

Talk to you soon.
Angela

P.S. for Chris - If you think you can come for one of
the weekends, you should choose Stacey's shower - it
won't hurt my feelings!  :)
