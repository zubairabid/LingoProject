What an interesting idea.  I worked at Williams for 5 years (pipeline and
telecom), and am pretty familiar with how they operate.  If you believe that
it would strengthen our chances to have them as a co-plaintiff, without
significant risk to us, then let's invite them in.  I don't think we are at
risk of disclosing any competitive information that Williams doesn't already
know about us (but, clients, please let me know immediately if you disagree),
and I know that you will keep each of Williams' and Enron's confidential
information separate and private.  I wonder how their entry would affect the
time we need to put on our case?  I also wonder if there is enough to bring
them in and still have a polished presentation?

If you decide this would be best for Enron, then unless you hear otherwise
from me, invite them in.
