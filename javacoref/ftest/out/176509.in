CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT
PER CPUC RULE 51

All Parties -

We are re-sending this message from yesterday, regarding the February 7
meeting.  I apparently did something wrong with the addressing, and many of
the messages were "returned to sender."

I am re-sending it, just to be sure that everyone receives notice of the
February 7 meeting.

Thank you.

CONFIDENTIAL SETTLEMENT DOCUMENT
PER CPUC RULE 51

INTERESTED PARTIES:

Based on discussions with a number of parties, we have determined that there
is general support for a one-day informational Gas Accord II Workshop on
Wednesday, February 7, 2001.

Accordingly, PG&E will host an informational meeting on February 7, in San
Francisco.  We have shortened the workshop, from two days to one very full
day, and will focus on the major issues and proposals.  Attached is our
suggested agenda with topics listed by their associated section in our
December 2000 comprehensive Settlement Proposal.

The February 7 Workshop will start at 9:00 a.m. and end around 5:00 p.m.  We
will be meeting at PG&E headquarters, in Conference Room 300, 77 Beale
Street, San Francisco.  We will not be providing lunch at this workshop due
to spending restrictions.  However, we hope to provide coffee and water.

At this point, we also would request that all parties to reserve February 21
and 22, 2001, on their calendars, for the next workshop and feedback
discussion on PG&E's December 2000 Settlement Proposal.

We look forward to meeting with those of you who can attend on February 7.
Also, we continue to be available at any Party's request to meet
individually to go over the December Settlement Proposal in detail.  Please
feel free to contact either of us, and we can make the necessary
arrangements.
