PSC Staff has asked us to poll our active Marketers to determine who
might be EDI compliant and has been utilizing EDI transactions such as
enrollment, drop, historical information and current usage. The goal
here is to find suitable partners for testing EDI transactions that are
scheduled to become effective at the end of this year. If your company
is currently actively using EDI and is interested in testing with
KeySpan in the next several months, please forward me the proper contact
person in your organization along with their telephone number. Thank
you.
