Hello Everyone,

As many of you know, we held Rounds 1 and 2 of Rice MBA  interviews last week.  As a result of those interviews, 8 candidates will be joining us for Super Saturday interviews November 2 - 4.  These candidates are Scott Arndt, Luigi Calabrese, Ivy Ghose, Chris Hysinger, Saul Keeton, Joe Rozelle, Josh Weber, and Joan Williams.

To help them prepare for their Super Saturday interviews and answer any questions they may have about the Program or Enron in general, we will be taking the candidates to a casual dinner on Monday, October 22.

Date:  Monday, October 22, 2001
Time:  7:00 pm
Location:  Carrabba's Italian Grill (3115 Kirby Drive)

By this email, I am requesting 5 volunteers to join us.  Please contact me if you are interested, and the first 5 of you to respond will be joining in the fun!

Thank you,

Julie Davidson
