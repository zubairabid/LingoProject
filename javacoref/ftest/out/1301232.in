Kirk - My update was regarding storyline video with actors/actresses. Enron
Legal is now reviewing the scripts we will need for this video shoot.
This timeframe communicated below is NOT applicable for the Enron experts
who will be filming expert stories. The video shoots for the Enron Expert
Stories will be held December 10th and 11th and Ann Chen will be working on
this (I have forwarded her your response below). However, I agree with your
comment to Phillip. We need to identify these additional Enron experts to
be filmed as soon as possible.
Sorry for the confusion and again, thanks for your help.

Team
FYI
Sheri
The 3 SME's that have already committed to being on film need to be keep in
the lope regarding the timeline. Also check with these 2 SME's for
additional candidates (i.e. check with Mark Reese to see if Lamar Frazier
would be interested). I would like to be conferenced in on the media calls
& meetings. Also cc me on their emails or forward to me  their  emails.
This will keep me in the loop. Thanks
Phillip
If you have some additional people in mind, we need them identified as soon
as possible. Thanks
Cheers
Kirk
