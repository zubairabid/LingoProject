Dear All,

Sally's recommendation to include Joannie is necessary to make sure
everyone
knows "The Plan" for the Enron board dinner and any other future
Enron/Lay
joint function that Ken and I might host.  Let's set a meeting date
for near
future.  A party check list needs to be made and agreed on by all.
Below
are some outstanding items that need to be addressed:

1.	Invitation list beyond board members and spouses.  (KLL
needs to
determine this ASAP.)
2. 	Decide on a consistent "Theme" that will tie everything
together.  (I
am leaning toward "Patriotic.")
3. 	Choose an invitation from Events.
4.	Decide on a holiday gift for board members. (Received
great gift ideas
from Tori and Barb; Ken and I will 			decide on
something this weekend.)
5. 	Spouse gifts are on hold.  (It's a Radko ornament
w/proceeds going to
terrorist relief effort.  Sally, send an e-		mail attachment
copy to
everyone to see.)
6. 	Choose appropriate paper and ribbon for gift wrapping.
7.	Choose two separate items for males and females to pick
that will
determine their respective dinner table.
8. 	Decide on table cloths, overlays and napkins.
9. 	Decide on table centerpiece arrangements.
10.	Decide on other floral/holiday items needed.
11.	Decide on tree decorations.
12.	Pick a caterer and menu. (Maybe ask three caterers for
menu
suggestions, pick the best from each and have them 		prepare
the entire meal
for a committee to decide.)
13.	Decide on what the pre-party lobby entertainment should
be and reserve
it.
14.	Confirm whether Sally has reserved the piano player, Bob
Henchen (Sp?).
15. 	Decide on Father Christmas and reserve him.

Thanks, Linda
