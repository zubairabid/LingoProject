Paul,

An Amendment to Appendix "C" will need to completed by both the pool that the
meters are being transferred from and the pool that the meters are being
transferred to.  I have discussed this issue with Heidi Boyd at Columbia
Energy
and I believe she will complete this form on their behalf in order to delete
the
meters.  You will also need to complete this form in order to add the meters
to
Clinton's LGA pool once the Pooling Agreement has been completed and the pool
becomes effective.  I will fax the form to Heidi this morning.  It must also
be
signed by the producer.  Please confirm your fax number (614-760-2794) and I
will be happy to fax the form to you as well.

Carol
