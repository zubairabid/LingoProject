To All -

I have been asked to be the Legal Department stakeholder for the final
development and implementation of the iBuyit program.  Basically, iBuyit is
an intranet based procurement and payables systems being developed for
implementation across Enron.  It is intended that this system will become the
standard method for purchasing any number of services and for paying the
invoices associated with these purchases.

As a stakeholder, it is my responsibility to assist with the development of
the product and its marketing (internal to the various Enron Legal
Departments).  In order to ensure that the development and implementation run
as planned, the program calls for the appointment of "Change Agents," -
defined as:

"individuals who are highly respected within their area and known as the 'GO
TO' people among their peers."

Though I am sure this definition fits each of you to a tee within your
respective departments, I am also well aware that schedules may prohibit you
from being the Change Agent.  Accordingly, what I am in need of is assistance
in designating that one person within your respective departments who can
become the Change Agent for your group.  The responsibilities of this
position are the following:

- to disseminate communications regarding the project
- to develop awareness and ownership of the product among their department
- to encourage use of the product
- identify those who will need training
- encourage peer training attendance
- engage in rumor control (basically relay the facts of the program and not
the myths (e.g., the product will replace jobs))

In picking the appropriate candidate, I would make sure that he/she has a
working knowledge of the procurement and payables practices of your group,
together with knowledge of the SAP system.  Since the iBuyit system will
interface with SAP, this latter knowledge would be very useful.

Please let me know as soon as possible who is the likely candidate from your
group so that I can meet with them and bring them up to speed on the
program.  For your benefit, I have attached below the general information
that has been provided to stakeholders about  the program.

If any of you should have any questions, please call me.

Thanks.
