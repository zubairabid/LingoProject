Before I draft a response, I wanted to clarify that Section 3.0 of Schedule "C" to the Contracting Party Agreement governing NGX provides for the determination of unsecured credit availability, which is essentially a collateral threshold, for investment grade counterparties or counterparties that have provided an investment grade guarantee, which can be determined in the sole discretion of NGX, but with a maximum for BBB credits of Cdn. $30 million (the previous maximum for BBB+ credits was Cdn. $35 million).
Accordingly, it is arguable that NGX can apply whatever unsecured credit threshold it chooses, however, arguably, it must do so acting in a commercially reasonable manner and having regard to its equitable treatment of similar graded credits.  Accordingly, I will draft a response on this basis, imposing an obligation on NGX to treat us reasonably and equitably, but in the meantime, I believe that we should be taking steps to satisfy NGX's credit requirements both by providing the margin they require and by having the traders minimize their position to the extent possible.
I will forward a draft response shortly.
