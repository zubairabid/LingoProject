Our UBP group met for two days last week in St. Louis, along with GISB and AGA reps.  UBP is definitely on board with creating the retail electric quadrant of an EISB.  We have been working extensively on getting the membership in line with a national organization.  Attached is a "draft" governance document that was completed at our meeting last month.  When this document was initiated, we were unsure of the progress to an EISB and it was developed to accommodate either a stand-alone retail organization until the EISB was formed or to be used as a part of the EISB organization.  AGA has been off on their own developing details for the retail Gas quadrant of EISB.  We have been very vocal in stating that they cannot develop these documents in a vacuum with only gas utility representation; they must reach out to Suppleirs, Services, etc.  The AGA member told us at our meeting that they plan to have an open meeting sometime in November to gain input.  We'll wait and see how that develops.  A Virginia SCC staff member is also working to get us some time in front of the Electricity Committee to update them on our progress and continue to foster their support of our endeavor.  Please feel free to let me know if you have any questions.  Thanks.
