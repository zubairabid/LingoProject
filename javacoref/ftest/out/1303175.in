The pool will be starting this Thursday, 8/30 and running through 11/24.  Try to pay up asap ($100 each).  Either give the money to me or Derek Wilson.

The official rules are as follows:

1. The lines for all games other than Thursdays will be Danny Sheridan's from the Friday edition of the USA Today, for the Thursday games the lines will also be Danny 	Sheridan's but from the Thursday edition of the USA Today.  These are the only games you can choose from.

2. You must pick 5 different games a week against the spread in rule # 1 and assign priorities of 5,4,3,2,1.  In other words the game you are most sure of you would assign 	a 5 priority, and least sure of assign a 1 priority.  The priority selections of the games you win are totalled up to determine your weekly score.  For example if your 	priority 4 and priority 2 game cover the spread for the week and the 5,3, and 1 do not then you will have a weekly score of 6 (4 + 2).

3. All picks must be in by 2:00pm on Thursday for Thursday games and 2:00pm on Friday for weekend games.  Send your selections to enronsportsbook@yahoo.com  	or call Derek Wilson (x37523), Mark Friedman (x36446), or Aaron Martinsen (x36726) if you are on the road or do not have email access for some reason.  This is so we can reply to everyone 	on Friday with a summary of everyone's picks for the week.

4. If you do not select teams by the deadline your teams and their priority for the prior week will roll into the current week.  If one of your previous week's teams has a bye or 	doesn't have a spread in Sheridan's odds, you receive a 0 for that game.

5. If your team pushes you lose, you must BEAT the spread.

6. The high score for the week collects the weeks winnings (should be $100 as long as no one flakes).  If there is a tie, the winner is decided by the 5 game cumulative 	margin of victory against the spread with each game margin of victory being equally weighted.  If there is still a tie, those players will split the weekly winnings.

7. The remainder of the pot will be split up at the end w/ 50% to 1st, 30% to 2nd, and 20% to 3rd.
