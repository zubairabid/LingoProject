Who controls, developes and designs the activeX control?  If the control is developed in housen the component should follow and proper review/release process and then signed for production.  If this control is developed by an outside source, what is the functionality of the object?  what processes where taken to ensure the assurance of "fair-play" from a security risk evaluation point on this version and all potention upgrade versions?  And what relationship do we have with them to inquire about a signed version of their component?
Sorry for the incovienence of these queries, and I am sorry that these questions have to come from a desktop architect.  But to maintain tight security to ensure the stability for Enrons network, I think that these are important issues.
