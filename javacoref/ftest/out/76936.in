I visited with John Higgins, Bridgeline's attorney and discussed the warehouseman's lien.  I pointed out the Section 542 of the bankruptcy code requires them to turn over property of the estate and our position is they don't have a valid lien.  I also indicated they were opening themselves up to damages for violation of the bankrupcty stay.  John indicated that since this issue (whether Article 7 of the UCC applies to natural gas storage)  would be a case of first impression they would be willing to litigate considering the amounts involved.  Summary - They are not willing to release the gas.  They are willing to release gas in excess of the amounts we owe to them, but only if stipulated that they are not waving their rights to assert the warehouseman's lien.  At this point it is probably better to get some gas and then decide whether to litigate the remainder.  Thoughts?  Stuart,  the answers to your questions are inserted below.
