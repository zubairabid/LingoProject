Greetings Brothers,

We are happy to announce that Frank Roby is planning to be with us at
homecoming. Also, Jim Dent has surfaced in Oklahoma City and told me that
he also plans to swell the numbers in Dallas this October.

You should have received Elvis and Margaret's generous and humorous
invitation to come party and trash their house Friday night of homecoming
weekend. Many thanks to the Thompson's for providing a place where we can
ALL get together.

Remember...Woody has volunteered to purchase a block of tickets for the
game. Just e-mail him the number of tickets you would like.

If you're interested in some golf on Friday...contact John Grumbles:
John_Grumbles@berryplastics.com

SMU vs. Nevada will be played at 11:00am on Saturday at the NEW CAMPUS
STADIUM.

The class of 1975 will be having a reunion(probably Sat. evening) If  you
are interested and have not received any information, contact:
hmeadows@mail.smu.edu with your  name, address and class of 75 noted.

A number of us will be in town Thursday. Let's try to figure out a  place to
chow down and launch us into some night life. Anybody have any  ideas of
suggestions???

Don't forget the attached picture.
