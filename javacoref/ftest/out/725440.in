Just so that everyone is aware, the units at Station 4 can be operated at levels above their rated horsepower of 4,000 during periods of lower ambient temperatures.  Clark ambient rating increase from 100% torque at 100degF to 108% torque at 40degF.  I realize that this rating is weather dependent, but the horsepower is available if weather temperatures permit.
To obtain ambient rating as ambient temperatures permit, three unit modifications would have to be implemented; these might be handled by unit control programming only.  Clark allows ambient rating when jacket water and lube oil temperatures can be driven down proportionally to 135 and 125 degF respectively.  Jacket water and lube oil control valves may be needed to reduce jacket water and lube oil temperature as ambient temperature permits, and unit control programs would require modification to accommodate ambient ratings.
There may be environmental emission issues such as permitting the site for the higher horsepower.  Also, previous checks with Legal indicated these units could operate in the ambient rated zone if the units were purchased with this capability; ambient rating capability was part of the original purchase and stated as such in the unit purchase orders.
Again, I am just making sure everyone is aware of the unit capability at Station 4.
