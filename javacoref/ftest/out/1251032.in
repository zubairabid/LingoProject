Duke does plan to build a merchant plant in Curry County, NM.  They think it will be a 2-stage project with each stage 600 megawatts.  The proposed in-service date of the 1st phase is 2Q04.  They will need a minimum pipeline pressure off TW of 500 psi.  Perry Frazier and I have met with Duke reps as recently as Jan. 02 about this plant.  A draft interconnect agreement has been forwarded to Duke who is working on providing their comments to TW.  So far, we have not determined any items such as who will build a line to the plant and pay for and operate it.  I will keep everyone posted as this develops.
