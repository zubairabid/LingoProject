Sorry for the delayed response, however, I was not in the office last week.

Originally, on moving Azurix back into Enron CRM, it was decided to leave
Azurix on a separate insurance program to retain flexibility for potential
sale activity.  (We did combine them into the Enron Directors and Officers
Liability program as Azurix could no longer carry their own coverage,
following the ownership change.)

We have not considered the options in the event of a sale, should Wessex
and a select few assets not be included.  I understand that the current
liability limit maintained by Azurix is $600,000,000.  The Enron limit is
more than that.  As an Enron subsidiary, low liability limits are not
acceptable and in those cases where "separate" programs are purchased,  the
excess amount above the separate program is maintained here.  I am
traveling tomorrow and will return to the office Wednesday before noon.  We
need to meet and discuss.  I will phone you on Wednesday.
