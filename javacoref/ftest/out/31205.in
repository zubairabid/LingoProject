Hola cabrones,
Ok, aqui esta el plan! Due to some very important people dragging their bums things have changed slighty. We will now be going to Playa del Carmen. Many of us have been there before. It is a great place and well situated. The hotel is called the Rui Playa and the price is $585.00 smackeroos all inclusive. It is a fun jet package I found through Way to Go Travel agency here in town. It is a very nice place and I urge everyone going to look at the funjet travel site and check it out. There is two people to a room and we can work out when we get down there who's bunking with whom. Again the dates are leaving Thursday September 6th returning Sunday the 9th.  Please call Elizabeth at Wat to Go Travel at 713-467-2262 and work out paying. They can either send you the ticket or you can pick it up. Don and I have already reserved our places and I have left a list of those that have confirmed to me with Elizabeth. They are as follows. My! cell phone is 281-450-6115 please call me for anything. If I left anyone out please inform me all we need to do is give her the names. For those of you who may have to cancel I suggest buying the ticket insurance it's only $35. Please do this asap because sure as shit the prices just like morning wood will rise again.
