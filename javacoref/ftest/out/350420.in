These questsions seem to be focus on the modularity of the product.  This is
fine from the vendors' perspectives, however, from a Tariff perspective, it
hints at conceding to others' tariiffs/structures.  There should be a few
questions that paint the entire Real Flow solution - even referencing that a
tariff is available.
Also, can I assume the entities listed are endorsing eTransMart?  Or do they
not even know their name is referenced here?
