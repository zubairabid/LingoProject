Eddy,
I tried to check schedules but not everyone is on Outlook where I can see
their "open time".  Rebecca did tell me that 3pm is the best time  for her so
I recommend you plan for a 3pm phone call tomorrow.  From looking back at my
notes it appears that the participants from Houston should include:
Rebecca McDonald
Jim Hughes
Mark Haedicke
Jim Derrick
I'm copying everyone on this note to give a "heads up" regarding the phone
call for 3pm CST on Friday afternoon.  Eddy will provide dial-in information.
If this does not work for those in Brazil, feel free to call me at home -
281-392-9596 or cell 713-304-6073.
