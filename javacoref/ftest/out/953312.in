Mark,
Steve's comment has many merits. I think Stinson Gibner and Grant Masson
(physics Ph.D.'s) can help to identify
academic and industry sources to validate some of the claims.
On the other hand, even if our guests were wrong by a factor of 2 or 3 in
their time estimates, the technology
they develop will bring about a technological revolution with enormous
potential payoffs. It make sense to
stay close to them and  to explore potential investment opportunities.
