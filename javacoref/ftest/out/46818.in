FYI....

EnTelligence?
No, its not spelled wrong, it's the name of a prospecting website designed to
deliver market information on existing and potential customers to commercial
trading, mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers management
reports to analyze Enron,s position within the key industries that we serve.
Presently, commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring potential
customer information.  This system will standardize their resource tools and
add consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence combines
information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty, Credit
Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, Enpower, and ERMS with information from
external data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter to
identify customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and
search by region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the
prospecting process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects
improved. Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospecting,
Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and
Inactive Accounts.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are
loaded, but financial deals will be included soon, as well as other
commodities.

Alternatively, you can also access the site from Enron's homepage, under the
Information & Services section, go to the link called "EnTelligence".

To view deal data, a user will need to submit an eRequest and select either:
Trader, Manager, or Sr Manager security.  I would also recommend to add the
following applications to your eRequest: Dow Jones Interactive (DJI), and
Live Link.  DJI is to be able to view market information and Live Link is our
desktop documentation system which enables the user to view a contract from
your computer.

The following attachment is a sampling of a Market Penetration report
displaying a count of companies in the industry code "Electric Services" of
the total number Enron has dealt with and the total number of companies Enron
has not dealt with yet.  Also, a sample of Enron Power Marketing Group's Top
customers for physical deals within the last 12 months.


Give the system a test drive and let us know what you think! Any questions,
please call the EnTelligence helpdesk  at  713-853-3147.  Our website link
