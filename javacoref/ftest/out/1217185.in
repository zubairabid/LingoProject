I think I know what you're talking about.  I know you weren't asking for a
response but I can give a few quick observations based on my well highlighted
Order No. 888 and 888-A (without any review or knowledge of subsequent cases).

In Order No. 888, FERC allowed stranded costs to be directly assigned to the
departing customer either through a transmission surcharge or an exit fee.
Par. 31,036 at 31,797.  So in general, customers can't avoid paying for
stranded costs simply by bypassing.  FERC allowed utilities to file for
recovery of stranded costs for requirements contracts executed on or before
July 11, 1994, if they did not contain explicit stranded cost provisions or
provisions prohibiting stranded cost recovery.  Id. at 31,810.
There appears to be a loophole that, if applicable, would allow bypass.  For
contracts that don't contain an explicit stranded cost provision and that
allow the customer to terminate service upon notice, if the customer gives
notice that it would no longer purchase its requirements from the incumbent
utility, the FERC does not allow the utility to amend the contract to add a
stranded cost provision.  However, in that case, the utility could seek to
recover stranded costs through its rates for transmission services to the
customer provided it could rebut the presumption that it had no reasonable
expectation of continuing to serve.  Id. at note 679.  Accordingly, the
customer could avoid the stranded costs if it could bypass transmission
service.
If the loophole does not apply (because the contract does not have such a
notice provision), the customer could file a Federal Power Act Section 206
proceeding arguing that the contract is no longer just and reasonable,
wherein the customer would have the burden of proof.  But, if they do, the
incumbent utility would still have an opportunity to file for stranded cost
recovery but it must do so in that customer's Section 206 proceeding.  Order
No. 888-A, Par 31,049 at 30,400.  Likewise, if the utility has already filed
for recovery of stranded costs, the customer must make any Section 206 claim
in that case.  Id.
The FERC also decided that both FERC and the states have the authority to
address stranded costs that result when retail customers obtain retail
wheeling and that utilities are entitled to an opportunity to recover their
prudently incurred costs.  However, FERC will only entertain requests to
recover stranded costs caused by retail access if the state PUC does not have
authority to address stranded costs when the retail wheeling is required.
Order No. 888 at 31,824-25.  I don't know anything about what the individual
states have done.

I hope this helps.
