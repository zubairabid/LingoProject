The October 16 Southern RTO filing is finally up on its website at
www.southernco.com.  Look at the RTO documents and presentations.  They have
filed it as a petition for declaratory order asking that the Commission
approve their Gridco structure and rate proposal.  I did talk with FERC staff
yesterday when the filing was not on the web and told them that Southern was
the last to get their proposal up on the web.
