This is the first analysis of 'Twingate'  that points out the obvious. John Williams exposes the exploitation of an unfortunate incident by two Austin  promoters who are also Democrat activist. The conduct of  the teenage twins is indefensible; Chuy's  conduct is outrageous.
The girls made a silly mistake; Chuy's made a calculated grab for commercial promotion, at best, and engaged in despicable dirty political activity at worst.Chuy's smug press release confirms either or both conclusions.
The twins will pay a price for their conduct. I hope every parent, conservative, and other decent Texans that abhors shameless exploitation of the underage girls, will ensure that Chuy's pays a price for their conduct.
I will not set foot in Chuy's and ask that everyone with a sense of decency join in expressing their outrage at Chuy's despicable conduct. In Texas we have the choice of an abundance of Tex-Mex in less hostile environments.
