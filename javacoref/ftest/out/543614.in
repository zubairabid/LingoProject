Tom - Thanks for the update. Most definitely would like copies of everything!

I understand that there have been internal meetings with GPG. What is the
status of their involvement?

We can make an assessment of feasibility after we have had time to digest the
information.  Any feedback from Bobby Rowan on the list of questions I sent
a couple of months ago?
