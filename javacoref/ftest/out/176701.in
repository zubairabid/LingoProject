We just received a phone call from the House Energy and Commerce Committee
Republican staff inviting Enron to meet in California on February 21 with
Chairman Tauzin, Rep. Joe Barton, and other Republican committee members.
The Committee intends to hold three meetings, probably in Pasadena, of a fact
finding nature.  The meetings will be CEO level and will not be official
hearings.  Instead, the meetings will be more in the nature of a roundtable
session.  The three groups being invited are:  a)generators/marketers; b)
IOUs; and c) State and consumer groups.  The Chairman is interested in
hearing about solutions, and less interested in "who's to blame."    Other
participants in our group are:  Dynegy, Southern, Reliant, Duke, Calpine, and
Williams.  They intend to also include a few natural gas suppliers in our
group.   Our session is expected to start at 10:00 a.m.  Although they are
asking for CEO level participation, I expect we could substitute someone
under that rank.  However, I would recommend we try to accommodate their
request for CEO attendance given the meeting with be with Chairman Tauzin.
Enron historically has not had close ties to the new Chairman.
