Media Q & A
What did you receive from the SEC?
Enron received a letter and subsequent phone call requesting that we voluntarily provide information regarding certain related party transactions.
When did you receive the request from the SEC?
We received a fax on Wednesday afternoon, October 19, 2001, and a phone call on Thursday afternoon, October 20, 2001.
What did you do about the request from the SEC when you received it?
An informal inquiry is not a material event; however, because of the high visibility of Enron and the recent public spotlight on the transaction, we convened a meeting of our Board as soon as possible.  We recommended that we announce the SEC request; the Board agreed, and we made the release prior to the market opening on Monday, October 22, 2001.
What are you going to do about the request?
We are cooperating fully with the SEC and see the request as an opportunity to put this issue behind us.
These message points will be constantly changing and we will update you as the changes occur.
