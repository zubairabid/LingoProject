First off I want to thank all for their involvement and assistance in
addressing Zilkha's concerns regarding our availability calcs at Mill Run
Somerset. The customer is far from satisfied and in fact is questioning the
validity of our availability calcs since project inception.
I would like to suggest a conference call between Tim, Mark Walker, Joe
Thorpe and myself on which we would briefly discuss this issue. This call
should take no longer than 30 min. and I suggest we conduct this call today
at 4:00PM PDT.
Mark Joe and Tim, will this work for you all? Please advise..
