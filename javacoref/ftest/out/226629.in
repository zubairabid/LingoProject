Due to the timing differences I had a crack at including these changes.
Attached is an amended confirmation. The only change I was not sure about was
tightening up the temperature definition. Do you mean moving to greater
precision in rounding? No problem but we are following the UK approach.
I would be most interested in any comments Paul would have. By way of
background I consulted the London office on their rounding conventions for
Celsuis.
