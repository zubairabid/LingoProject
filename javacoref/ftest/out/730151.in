Okay...good news...they are playing all 4 lines at 7:00pm.  I think their
strongest line 1 player is out of town, but I think the rest of their team is
still pretty good.   Chancellors is at 6535 Dumfries.  Dumfries is one block
South of S.Braeswood, and the club is one block East of Fondren.  If you are
coming from 610 S., go west (left) on S. Braeswood,  left (south) on Fondren,
and left on Dumfries.  There's not a light, but I believe there is a left
turn lane.
