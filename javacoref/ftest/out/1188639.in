It is obviously a very high priority to ensure that BEA do not make the
Agency presentation covering EnronOnline available on their website.
Kevin/Jay: Can you please try to identify the appropriate BEA contact as a
matter of priority this morning?
Richard/Mark: Please advise as to how strong we can be in warning BEA not to
publish the information on their website.
Thanks,
Dave
