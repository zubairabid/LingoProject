Kirk,
Great to hear that the project is moving forward.  I think TW feels it's
emotionally vested at this point!  I will ask the Facility Planning folks to
get started on providing a more detailed "budget quality" estimate of the
cost to construct the interconnect and metering station.  With recent changes
in FERC regulations concerning pregranted authority to construct delivery
points, TW can immediately proceed to build without the complication of a
FERC prior notice filing as was required in the past.

Therefore, the only limiting factor at this point is the time it takes to put
together the estimate, as well as the documentation we'll need in order to
implement a new delivery point on the system.  To this end, I see the
following documents:

1.  Letter Agreement authorizing TW to open a work order to proceed with the
budget quality estimate.  This will involve a commitment by Big Sandy to
reimburse TW for the cost of the engineering if Big Sandy ultimately pulls
out of the project.
2.  A Facilities Construction and Operating Agreement providing for the
reimbursement by Big Sandy for TW's construction of the tap and/or metering
station.  This agreement would also provide for TW's operation of the
metering station if Big Sandy elects to it to TW specification in order to
avoid the CIAC.
3.  An Operator Balancing Agreement (OBA), a standard tariff form agreement
defining the role of Big Sandy as delivery point operator as well as the
disposition of any volumetric imbalances that may accrue during the month.

From a timeline standpoint, we can be in the position to get these documents
completed within a relatively short time (30 - 60 days?) depending on whether
there are any sticking points in our negotiations.  By the way, the only
agreement that may take some time to work through is no. 2 on the list,
although with our recent experience in hooking up other plants on the system
this past year, we've already done a lot of the "lawyering" spade work.

Not that I'm especially found of meetings, but it's been a while since we've
met to discuss the physical requirements of the facilities.  Moreover, we've
got some new people in our Facility Planning and Engineering and Construction
groups who would benefit from meeting their counter parties on the project
side.  May I suggest a face-to-face meeting where I can bring our planners
and engineers to meet with their counter parties to kick off this project?
We can meet anywhere its convenient for you guys.

I look forward to working with you on this project.
