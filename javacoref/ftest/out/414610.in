I was informed late last week that EOL is looking to me to determine whether
U.S. counterparties should be permitted to trade European power products via
EOL.  According to Edmund Cooper and Tana Jones, the London office is
deciding whether European counterparties should be permitted to trade U.S.
power products via EOL.  I believe that this allocation of counterparty
review responsibility (with regard to power products) should be reversed.
The legal team for U.S. power is in the best position to determine whether a
counterparty, domestic or European, has the requisite legal authority to
trade U.S. power, and I believe that the London office is better positioned
to determine whether a counterparty, U.S. or other, has the requisite
authority to trade a European power product.

As we have discussed during the last week, a counterparty must have specific
federal regulatory authorization in order to trade U.S. power.  I cannot
identify any foreign counterparties from my lists of federally authorized
entities and think it highly unlikely that a foreign counterparty will have
the necessary authority to trade U.S. power.  Jim Fallon has expressly
instructed me that in the event we do not currently trade U.S. power with a
counterparty and cannot otherwise confirm that a specific counterparty
possesses regulatory approval to trade power, a counterparty should NOT be
permitted to trade U.S. power via EOL.  Accordingly, I return to my initial
position that except for those foreign counterparties with whom we are
currently trading over-the-counter (if any), all foreign counterparties
should be granted read-only access to U.S. power products.  In the event a
specific counterparty requests access to U.S. power trading, we can examine
whether that specific party possesses the necessary authority to trade
power.

Edmund Cooper and Justin Boyd are reviewing whether a similar bar should
apply to the trading of European power by U.S. counterparties, and I will
defer to their judgment on that issue.

Please call me at *36121 with any questions or comments.
