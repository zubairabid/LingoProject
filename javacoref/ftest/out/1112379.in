Sue, et.al.,
The Washington Office may have more detail, but based on a little reading I did this morning, I think the answers to Sue's questions are as follows:
DOE has commissioned a study (NTGS 2001) as part of addressing the transmission issues raised in the National Energy Policy (NEP) released in May, "One of the recommendations directed to the Secretary of Energy to examine the benefits of establishing a national electrical grid, identifying major transmission bottlenecks and remedies to remove them."  It is not clear from my reading whether the study team is internal to DOE or if a contractor is involved; I suspect a combination.  The workshops are scheduled to collect comments from industry, state government, environmental groups, etc. (the ubiquitous stakeholders).
The NTGS 2001 is accepting both oral and written statements, with a comment portal on their website with recommendations and comments received through October 10, 2001.  A transcript of the proceedings of the workshops is to be published.  No other documents are mentioned on the website, however, I expect that a final report to "...recommend regulatory and market based approaches that will stimulate new investment in our interstate bulk power transmission system".
The goal of the study is for the respond to the NEP directive so the Secretary of Energy is the apparent decision maker.
The NTGS will no doubt identify much the same information as that done for the Western Governor's Association (WGA) during the past summer.  The major physical constraints in the systems are well known, so the key questions are: (1) how is investment to be made going forward and (2) what will be done to facilitate siting of needed transmission.  The first of these questions cannot be fully resolved until the future structure of the industry is known.  This in turn means the RTO debate must be resolved.  The NTGS's goals are best served by RTO formation -- the larger the better-- so RTOs formation should be boosted by this effort. At the same time, many states are resisting the Big 5 RTO vision of West, Midwest, NE, SE & Texas RTOs covering the whole country.  The states also care deeply about the second issue, namely should the siting become a Federal responsibility as it is in gas pipelines or should regional process be developed by the states?  I think most states acknowledge (I know they do in the West) that transmission siting needs to look beyond state borders, but governors and legislatures are loathe to cede this authority to Washington DC.
Linda, Ray or Sarah, if you have better information please correct my suppositions.  We also ought to discuss the positions we should take on these matters in making comments at the workshops.  I am attaching the information I submitted for the WGA study.  They do not address exactly the same points as DOE's study issues, but perhaps they can serve as a possible starting point for discussion.
