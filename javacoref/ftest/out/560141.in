Shona -
To share with the others our telephone discussion, the notification template
was not my request, it was requested directly by Skilling.  I know your group
is working hard to meet mangagement expectations, and in accordance with your
request below, Market Risk is happy to help you transition into this revised
reporting format by reviewing the template prior to your distribution until
you are comfortable with the reporting requirements.   The new P/L
notification limits and limit changes that will be in effect  next Tuesday
should dramatically decrease the number of notifications, so that should
help.  It probably makes sense to re-distribute the policy to your business
unit controllers and the traders so they understand the policy requirements.
Another issue that we discussed yesterday is the source of the violation
explanations.  These should be provided to you by the head trader of that
commodity group.  Under the policy, that commodity group manager is
responsible for compliance with the risk management policy for the
commodities under his responsibility, along with the head of the energy ops
for that commodity group.  If the traders are not providing these
explanations to you or to your counterparts (ops desk head / business unit
controller), I'll be happy to send them an e-mail explaining their compliance
obligation under the policy.  Why don't you talk to each of the business unit
controllers, consider whether a process is already in place for this feedback
(as I understand it is for Global Products, for example), and if you'd like
me to send an e-mail to whoever you're having difficulty with, I will - just
let me know who.  Our Market Risk desk heads will be happy to review their
explanations, but the problem is, they can see whether they're short or long
and how the market moved in comparison, but it's the trader that can and
should explain why they took a position, whether they're adjusting it based
on the market moves, etc..
Let me know what else I can do to help streamline the process.
