Hi all

Just wanted to ensure everyone is proceeding with their ticket sales. If
you're having problems selling (more than 3 tickets left over) then
please email everyone what you have, otherwise you should be able to
manage to sell 3 or less tickets to someone between now and next Friday.

As a reminder, requests for Corporate Sponsor tickets go to Chris
Bishop. Make sure requests are made early as we will start to sell them
over the course of the week.

Thnaks

Bill
