Curriculum Review Task Force (CRTF)
Report # 10 (November 5, 2001)


October was a very busy and productive month for the Curriculum Review Task
Force. We had intensive three-hour meetings on October 3 and 9 which were
followed by routine meetings on October 22 and 29. On the 18th, three CRTF
members (George Arnold, Craig Watson, and Raj Ambrose) participated in a
meeting of the Academic Affairs Committee of the Trustees which was devoted
entirely to the Curriculum Review.

As explained in my last report, the CRTF obtained unanimous agreement on the
five Educational Goals: A. Critical Thinking, B. Communication, C. Values,
Inquiry, and Exploration, D. Variety of Human Experience, and E. Depth of
Knowledge and Integration of Learning with an addendum on Wellness/Health
Co-curriculum. The Task Force then used an intensive work session to brain
storm on the operational ends of these goals. Further discussion and some
pruning led to 4 or 5 operational ends for each goal. Two members of the
Task Force wrote the descriptive statements for each goal and its
operational ends. These were then reviewed by the full Task Force and with
another member contributing the preamble, the draft statement on Educational
Goals (copy attached) was ready for presentation to the faculty. At the
request of the CRTF, the Faculty Senate reviewed these educational goals and
decided to send them for a ACommittee of the Whole@ discussion at the
ensuing faculty meeting. We would like to point out that the CRTF looked at
several models from other schools in preparing the Educational Goals. Some
of these schools are very similar to Monmouth College.

The ten trustees who were present at the Academic Affairs Committee meeting
had a preview of the draft educational goals. The trustees received them
very well and made some valuable suggestions.

The CRTF has spent considerable time discussing how these goals can be
achieved through a well-planned, four-year, integrated curriculum. The
work-load, calendar, departmental structure, general education models, and
available resources are some of the major issues that are being considered
in relation to the achievement of these educational goals.

Dr. Tom Sienkewicz brought to our attention that Dr. Gregory Dougherty, who
gave the recent Bernice L. Fox Classics Lecture, is a member of the
Curriculum Review Task Force at Randolph Macon College which is also in the
midst of a major Curricular Review. As part of this process, they had
studied the Educational Programs of about half a dozen colleges which are
similar to Randolph Macon and our college happened to be one of them. We
invited Dr. Dougherty to the meeting of our Task Force on October 29 and had
a very fruitful discussion with him. Of particular interest to us is
Randolph Macon=s new first year program which uses a three-course sequence
of ALearning Communities@ developed and taught by all their faculty taking
turns. We decided to keep in touch.

Raj Ambrose, Chair.


Draft Educational Goals

The AEducational Goals@ listed and briefly described below represent
consensus of the Curriculum Review Task Force about intended outcomes and
experiences of the academic program that should guide review and revision of
the Monmouth College curriculum, especially with reference to Areinvesting
in pedagogy@ and re-imagining design to enhance student learning.

We are confident that this list summarizes educational goals central to the
liberal arts philosophy of higher education.  We also understand that these
educational goals affirm and clarify  elements of the Mission Statement of
the college and those Apurposes@ derived from the Mission that directly
address the academic program.

Having spent considerable time articulating these goals, we are keenly aware
that agreement about the language we use to describe them is both important
for subsequent stages in the review process and achievable only through
discussion and mutual compromise.

Our aim then in the ACommittee of the Whole@ discussion upcoming at the
November 4th Faculty meeting is to present this statement for your review,
explain what we mean by the language we have used, listen to your responses,
and, if necessary, make changes.

What will we do if and when we win your agreement to this or a revised
version of AEducational Goals@?

1. We will decide questions we have already begun to
discuss: AGiven these goals, how best may we enable students to achieve them
in four years of undergraduate education?  Specifically, does our present
array and structure of disciplines optimally promote achievement?  Our
calendar?  Our workload?  Our general education program?   Our pedagogical
approaches in classroom settings?  Our extra-curricular, curricular
programming (residence education, internships, off-campus opportunities,
etc.) ?

2. In light of this critique (which in the coming months
will itself sponsor more frequent  discussions of possible proposals for
change in calendar, workload, General Education, etc.), we will attempt to
map and model then four years of undergraduate education ideally designed to
achieve our educational goals.   In this phase of the process especially, we
will involve faculty as researchers, resources, and planners to a)
understand our student clientele and their typical cognitive development; b)
revise our current curriculum; and c) enhance pedagogy and clarify
assessment strategies pertinent to our educational goals.

With approval of AEducational Goals@ we imagine spending the next five to
seven months on stages 1 and 2, with the understanding that it may be
possible to pass new initiatives and proposals for revision incrementally
along the way.    Furthermore, given the scope of our Areview,@ it may well
be necessary to imagine a multi-year schedule of planning and phased
implementation that extends well beyond the term of the current task force=s
assignment.

It should be noted that competencies like critical thinking and rhetoric,
though presented conceptually as separate entities under different goals,
will actually be interwoven throughout the curriculum and work interactively
with other competencies and goals.

A. Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is an acquired intellectual process through which
students are able to analyze carefully and critically all ideas and
information by distinguishing fact from fallacy, questioning assumptions,
synthesizing knowledge, and arriving at logical conclusions. This competency
is demonstrated by the ability of students to:
1.	understand the logic, validity and relevance of their own arguments
and the information and ideas they observe and work with;
2.	pose and solve complex problems and make informed decisions;
3.	understand and apply the scientific method where the concerned
discipline requires such an approach; and,
4.	work with numerical data and apply quantitative reasoning in
processing such data.

B. Communication
Communication is a foundational competency which the students absolutely
need and continue to learn across the curriculum with a conscious effort to
improve their reading, writing, speaking, listening and information literacy
skills. This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students to:
1.	use effectively and grammatically a broad English vocabulary in
speaking and writing through accomplished rhetorical strategies;
2.	access, evaluate, select, interpret, and incorporate information and
media sources in their studies and to be productive in the modern
technological world;
3.	have a basic understanding of another language (besides English) and
its cultural background; and,
4.	interact with others with empathy and understanding and collaborate
effectively in group settings.

C. Values, Inquiry, and Exploration
It is the ability of students to explore the nature and scope of the human
condition through specific modes of inquiry and to develop a system of
values that would help them make real choices and assume responsibility for
their actions. This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students
