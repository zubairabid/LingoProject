Attached are the minutes from the February 6 Corporate Responsibility Task
Force meeting.   Also attached is a chart outlining in more detail the
metrics for success for each subcommittee.  The second document is the result
of a meeting among subcommittee chairs and other interested task force
members to help flesh out their purpose as a step toward developing a
measurable work plan.
Let me know if you have questions or comments.  If you have not been
contacted already, you will be hearing from your subcommittee chairs shortly
regarding your next subcommittee meeting.  We also plan to set the date of
the next overall task force meeting within the next couple of weeks.
