SERTO Team,

Enron's outreach meetings in the south begin next week.  For those of you engaging in that process (Dan, Joe, Marchris, Barbara) I thought you should be aware of the DC feedback from their RTO meetings with members from the south.


Rep Burr (NC) -
Concerns about impact of RTOs on when, if ever, North Carolina would opt for retail competition.  Does not expect their "voluntary RTO" bill to be the final work product of the subcommittee.  Final compromise would move in the direction of the expected mandatory RTO features of any Barton draft bill.  Sees RTOs are inevitable.  Also seemed somewhat more conflicted in our direction now that the Grid South model of North Carolina's Duke Energy is the preferred platform in a single Southeast RTO.

Sen. Shelby (AL) -
Reluctance to mandate RTOs
Sympathy for incentives for "voluntary" RTOs
Not much interest in giving FERC more jurisdiction on anything
Skepticism that Senate will act on electricity legislation

Sen. Bingaman (NM) -
Staff (today, 9/20).  Remains our strongest Senate supporters of large RTOs.  Open to our suggestions on transparency and market based rates.  Looks increasingly doubtful that there will be a markup of the electricity title or perhaps any energy bill this year.
