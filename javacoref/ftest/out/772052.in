Do we wnat to single out the Keystone I/C, or should we be more generic and state that if/when any interconnecting party refuses to take gas due to nitrogen, we will restrict the offending receipts? Also, what about other areas such as the Hugoton. We have had complaints from Mid-American and Nicor about nitrogen sensitive customers on their systems complaining. sj
