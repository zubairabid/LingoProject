Jim. Hope we can get together in Houston next week  to exchange notes.
Charles maybe we can have an extended meting Tuesday to get everyone up to speed.
At the NERC meeting today the Independent Board of Trustees asserted their independence by agreeing to the inputs of the stakeholders members and passing resolutions directing NERC   to be implement certain policy directives.
They (the Board) clearly see that FERC would have overall approval of regulatory commercial standards and practices. They know that NERC has to "compete" for a role in a future model for the industry.. and would like to organization to have a future.
On a parallel track, we hear that there is lots of interest in reliability legislation. We need to keep track of what is happening there.
From EPSA I heard that EEI has had members discussions about what to support in the future.
The EEI observer told the audience that NERC has a very short time to put a credible proposal on the table or they will be left behind.
