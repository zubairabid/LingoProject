As I mentioned on the phone, SCE moved FERC (in the FERC docket investigating
the California market) for a subpoena to produce information from the ISO's
Market Surveillance Committee.  In particular, SCE is requesting information
that the MSC referenced in its December 4, 2000 report to the FERC, wherein
it stated that "MSC stands ready to provide the Commission with what we
suspect are instances of the exercise of significant market power by specific
market participants.  We encourage not only the Commission, but other law
enforcement agencies as well, to use their authority to request from these
market participants the necessary information to confirm whether these
suspicions about the exercise of significant market power are in fact
correct."  The MSC also stated that it "could provide a number of instances
of what it suspects are suspicious bidding and scheduling behavior during the
summer and Autumn of 2000."

Here's an outline of the positions I think we should make in an answer:

The Commission should reject SoCal Edison's request for a subpoena because
FERC did not set its investigation for hearing.  Therefore, SCE's request is
a collateral attack on the Commission's order establishing the process for
its investigation in this case.  Further, it would allow Edison to access
this information to pursue its case against power marketers while denying
marketers an opportunity to prosecute their cases by denying them an equal
opportunity to serve discovery upon others (including the UDCs).
In the alternative, the Commission should allow all parties full discovery
rights and establish an appropriate protective order.
There may also be an argument that, since the MSC has delegated its authority
by FERC, some of the information Edison requested might fall under the
deliberative process privilege.  Gary Fergus suggested this argument.  Not
having done any legal research, I don't know how good of an argument it is.

Are there any other arguments we should make?  Should we have a conference
call on this?  Jim suggested that we should try to have WPTF file this answer
and I agreed.  At first, I was thinking that it would be okay for Ron to
draft the answer for WPTF.  However, on further consideration, if we end up
wanting to argue that another member of WPTF exercised market power,
Bracewell would have a conflict of interest that would prohibit it from
representing us.  Accordingly, WPTF should use other counsel.
