Dear VM,
Please find attached here a revised version of the HOW TO guide that I have put together to help Houston Settlements in their research of DMS's.  Please add any tips that you can think of and any comments that you might have.
I am planning on sending this out to the Settlements group on Monday 5-21-01.
Thanks,
