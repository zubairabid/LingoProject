John,
This confirms our conversation and agreement regarding the use of Citizens capacity under contract (#26520).  Citizens may move their primary delivery point under this agreement from the currently authorized points (Flagstaff and Kingman) to the Griffith Energy point, for all or any portion of the MDQ (25,000 MMBtu/d).  However, as we discussed, any such move of the primary delivery point is considered "permanent."   TW cannot reserve the same block of capacity simultaneously at two primary points.  If Citizens wants to move back to the original point(s) at a later date, another request must follow to move the delivery point.

We look forward to working with you to maximize the value of your capacity and to facilitate the operation of the Griffith delivery point.  Call me if you have any further questions.
