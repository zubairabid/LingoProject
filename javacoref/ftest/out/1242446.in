I received  a call from Randy Lebeau about hearing that Hemp. 3 volumes were going away Feb. 1st. I have since found out that it is true from Jerry knight with Oneok. They are diverting this gas over to one of their own gathering systems the 1st. of Feb. If marketing or the field has heard of any other gas being diverted off Northern please give me a call.

Thanks
Gary
