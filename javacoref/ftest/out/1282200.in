Janet --

Going forward Govt Affairs will coordinate with Services and Product Development (and other EWS and EES groups as appropriate, e.g. Credit) to ensure compliance with (1) licensing/registration, (2) bonding/security, (3) regulatory reporting, and (4) other.  I have asked Gloria Ogenyi to lead this effort for us.  We will need other groups to appoint a Lead for their teams as soon as possible (I will work with Evan, Legal, and Product Development to find out the appropriate people).

I fully concur with Rogers that within all new Product Development activities there must be a clear analysis of our obligations and appropriate resource allocation to continue supporting the market activity.   As important, just because we don't want to attract new business in a given market doesn't mean that our responsibilities have ended.  We need to ensure that our Product Development activities are accounting for the costs of these obligations over the long-term.  To ensure that we are selling in accordance with applicable regulations, I would recommend that Gloria be on the Product Development sign-off sheet.

In addition, we have already begun reviewing obligations, etc. for our current market activity (both wholesale and retail).  I will talk with Gloria to build the matrix of issues you referenced.  Our goal is to make current all of our market obligations.

I will call you to provide an update on the market review when I have more information.  If you want to talk about this, please call.

Thanks,

Jim

PS - I'll ask Gloria to give you an update on the IL bonding status.
