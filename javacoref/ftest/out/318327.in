Fred,
Sounds "do able".  Please contemplate what would be acceptable as "outs" for
them and for us.  A,lso, will you be getting RAC involved soon since we are
contemplating a binding agreement in the near future?
My best guess is that the LOI will be prepared in house, but I will discuss
this with Carlos, and we will advise K & S of their role.
Thanks,
