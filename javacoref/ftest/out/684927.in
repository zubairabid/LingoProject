Despite the postponement of company presentations this week by PWC-FAS,
Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo, all three companies as of today still plan
to conduct their on-campus interviews as scheduled.  Thus, to ensure that
they receive your resumes with time to prepare their interview lists, the
resume drop deadline for these companies, as well as Citigroup, will remain
Friday, September 14th, at 11:59 p.m.

We are currently working with the companies to reschedule their
presentations as soon as possible.  Please don't hesitate to contact me if
you have any questions or concerns.
