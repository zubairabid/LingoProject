Enclosed is a revised draft letter which a large group of CSA signatories
intend to send to the commission on Monday, in addition to any individual
comments the parties may file to the PD.  I am sending this draft to you as
I understand that some of you may not have seen the last version which was
distributed on Friday.  Our understanding now is the SoCalGas is likely to
sign the letter with a slight moderating of the tone of the final paragraphs
which describe our years of wandering in the wilderness.  ORA is for the
moment not going to sign.  The remainder of the key CSA parties will sign.
We are asking for everyone to get approval to me by phone or email
authorizing us to sign on their behalf and providing details of how you want
the name on the signature block to look by noon on Monday.  Please call me
if you have any problems with that or wish to discuss the letter.  Thank you
very much for your prompt attention to this.

Mike Day
