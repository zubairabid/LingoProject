Randy,

1.  The following is an update re contacting local counsel to review the IM
sections dealing with regulations:

Brazil- I have spoken with Jose Amelio Pinto and Maria Elissa with Tozzini's
firm.  I e-mailed to them last night excerpts from the IM dealing with the
regulations of the Brazilian projects. They have agreed to review the IM
regulatory sections for most of the projects (Elektro, CEG/Riogas, Gaspart,
and Cuiaba I) by today or tomorrow.  They did not work on Cuiaba II or III,
RioGen, or Puerto Suarez and consequently stated that in order to perform
the review, they would have to review all of the documents.  They are
attempting to track down names internally of the firms and attorneys that
worked on those projects.  Do you have any recommendations on who to contact
on these projects?

Argentina - Dr. Jose Martinez de Hoz.  Have called (and continue to call)
two numbers last night and this morning, and have left messages on
non-descript voice mail boxes.  No response.

Bolivia - Ramiro Guevara Rodriguez - Have called six numbers all night last
night and this morning, and have neither reached a person nor a voice
mailbox.  Other numbers/suggestions?

2.  Attached is a doc request list from Tozzini's firm for the completion of
their ongoing review of the Brazilian projects.  They stated that they will
most likely be unable to complete this review until Thursday or Friday due
to the amount of documents and to the fact that they still require more
docs.  Attached is a document request list.  We have already sent all of the
documents in the VE data room.  Can you recommend someone at Enron for us to
contact to fill this request?  I will cc Robert George on this e-mail in
case he has any thoughts or someone he knows who can help respond.

3.  At  Steve Kean's request, we aim to have an update on the status of the
local counsel reviews being performed in the various countries for Project
California.  We will include you on that update.
