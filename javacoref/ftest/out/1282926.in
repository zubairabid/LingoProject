Attached is a notice issued by FERC today extending the date for comments on RTO Week.  I think FERC is extending the deadline so that parties have time to review FERC Staff's notes (circulated yesterday) and comment on those notes.  FERC has not set a new date for comments but asks that they be submitted as soon as possible.
In that regard, it would help me in preparing our comments if each of you would read FERC's notes on RTO Week and provide me with your thoughts on those notes.  The comments are relatively detailed, and we should comment on issues raised in their notes that we feel need clarifying or highlighting.  We still want to make the arguments that it has already been proven that Right Sized RTOs are beneficial and that RTOs will not force states into retail access, but when we address specific issues, we should do so in response to FERC Staff's notes.
Let me know if you have any questions, and I look forward to your comments and thoughts on Staff's Notes.
Thanks
