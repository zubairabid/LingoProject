I am pleased to announce the recipients of the 2001 University of Texas Enron MBA Excellence Scholarships:

Each student will receive $10,000 in scholarship money based on their essays, interviews and on how they exemplified the vision, values and beliefs of Enron.
I have already notified  the winners, so  please join me in congratulating each one on a job well done.

Special thanks to everyone who participated in the selection of the winners.   Stay tuned for details on the date and time for the Scholarship Awards dinner slated for early next semester!

FYI... All of the candidates that interviewed were outstanding according to the scholarship interview team (Sally Beck, Andrea Reed, Roger Ondreko and Loftus Fitzwater).  I will be sending each of them a letter to thank them for their participation and encourage them to consider Enron when interviewing for full time opportunities next semester.

Thank you,

Karen Marshall
