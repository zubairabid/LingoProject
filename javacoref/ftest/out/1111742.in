Colleagues:

Indeed it was a very good meeting, and a good step forward.  It was a pleasant surprise to see RAC's desire to take the regulatory inputs in their calculations.  Guille and I informed them that we are working on a methodology that will likely come out of the three pilot projects currently in progress.

The last point that Guille mentioned, namely, "what are our suggestions to hedge the regulatory risks identified and quantified?" is a very interesting point and shall be addressed in due course.

The Team here is highly hopeful that with understanding the company's risk policy (currently under analysis; more that a week over due, and I take responsibility here) and aligning the regulatory practices GA should be able to provide a more quantitative contribution to RAC without affecting our relationships with the different commercial trams.

Of course, please let Guille and I know if you have any question.
