With Enron's rapid growth we need to maintain an ability to move employees
between operating companies and new ventures.  To do this it is essential to
have one process that will enable us to collect , update and retain employee
data.  In the spirit of One Enron, and building on the success of the
year-end Global VP/MD Performance Review Process, the  Enron VP/MD PRC
requests that all Enron Vice Presidents and Managing Directors update their
profiles. Current responsibilities, employment history, skills and education
need to be completed  via the HR Global Information System.  HRGIS is
accessible via the HRWEB home page on the intranet.  Just go to
hrweb.enron.com and look for the HRGIS link.  Or just type eglobal.enron.com
on the command line of your browser.

The target date by which to update these profiles is 7 July.  If you would
like to have a hard copy of a template that could be filled out and returned
for input, or If you need any assistance with the HRGIS application please
contact Kathy Schultea at x33841.




Your  timely response to this request is greatly appreciated.
