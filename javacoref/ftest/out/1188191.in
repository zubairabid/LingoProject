Thanks very much for your memo Paul it is very helpful.  I attach below for
completeness the To Do list put together by Elena in order to put Credit on
EnronOnline.
There are two remaining issues which require further thought:-
1.  How do we want to display Credit on a long term basis on EnronOnline.
For the short term, we can put credit out there but the number of updates
will be restricted.  Using Jay's best guess on a slow network connection the
initialization process will take upto 4 minutes and on a normal connection
250 updates every 30 seconds would prevent people from trading.   So we do
have some scaling issues? Our model doesn't really function for simultaneouse
changing of hundreds of products so really we need to actually get a much
better specific on how many updates you envisage.   Do you really envisage
that many updates?  Also we haven't yet experienced fast updates which we
will do when FX joins the system.
2.  We have approximately 4000 guest id and passwords?  Can these see credit
pricing from a due diligence perspective.
Elena will be leaving the EnronOnline group at the end of this week and Mark
Dilworth will be our main point of contact in Dave's absence.  Any questions
please do not hesitate to call me (713 853 3488).
