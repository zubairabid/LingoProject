Dick -- I totally agree with you that allowing the TPs to work in some
"credit" for adjustments that can only be made to their generation (and that
by definition will not be transparent to anyone) is bad.  Can you send me a
paper, email, etc. where they have said this and we can pursue it (whether by
alerting FERC, etc.)  Thanks.
