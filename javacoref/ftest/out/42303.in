Folks,

Tennessee Gas Pipeline has made a bankruptcy filing that is attached below.  Besides the normal complaints, they are claiming that we have not nominated since the petition date (Is this true?) or paid for firm storage service (Is our storage gas out of Bear Creek and did ENA pay for the storage service that was used?).  The last four pages of the filing has a listing of the contracts that Tennessee has indicated are still active.  I will contact EES about their contracts.

If you could think back and summarize the facts, I would really appreciate it.

Thanks,
Ruth
