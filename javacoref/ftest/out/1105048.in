Mark,
It has been a while since we last discussed the Oracle, TIBCO and BEAS contacts and what effect, if any, they will have on our e-commerce solutions that we are presenting to third parties.
As a review the following are the basic sets of offerings:
1) Third parties (gas pipelines, gas storage companies) will post their products on the EnronOnline website.
2) EnronOnline will build a private e-marketplace, essentially an EnronOnline look-alike, for third parties. EnronOnline will host the private e-marketplace using Enron hardware on Enron's premises. (Note: a second tier to this offering will allow the same third party to cross post its products simultaneously on EnronOnline as well as the private e-marketplace.)
3) A software license giving a third party the right to use EnronOnline software but maintain the application and website on its own premises using its own hardware.
4) A software sale (selling the object or source code) of EnronOnline software to third parties.
At one point,  we were expecting a response from outside legal council. Did we ever get anything in writing? If so, would you please forward it to me.
We are very close to defining commercial terms for building several private e-marketplaces (#2 above). We need to know if certain contractual conflicts exist and if so, what freedom do we have.
Please inform us of where you stand on these points so that we can move forward with pricing these options.
Thanks.
Carl
