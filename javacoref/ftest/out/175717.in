To my understanding, the utilities will get an unexpected windfall for their
nuclear units in 2001.  AB1890 specifies that they would receive 50% of the
benefits of the unit after the rate freeze.

Roger.  Can you confirm the numbers and the reference to AB 1890.

"Enron further notes that AB1890 specifies that the utilities would receive
50% of the benefits of the nuclear units after the rate freeze.  Assuming
that the nuclear units make up 4,000 MW and profit is $200/MWh, the utilities
will receive a $3.5b windfall out of this situation.  I think we should make
the point that it is inappropriate for utilities to make windfalls as a
result of their bad decisions (selling off more thermal then they were
required to and not hedging)."

I think we should insert these sentences after the "Enron notes that; ....."
that I put in my comments to you yesterday in blue under important principles.
