As you know, October 25 is the last day to file with FERC any initial
comments to the Offer of Settlement proposed by this Committee with respect
to, among other things, an allocation formula to provide the amount of each
seller's direct claims against each IOU, the return of collateral and the
winddown of the PX.

It would be most helpful for as many sellers as possible to arrange for
their FERC counsel to file papers in support of the Offer of Settlement.

Of course, if you have any questions about the Offer of Settlement, please
give me a call.  Thanks.
