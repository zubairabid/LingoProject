Jeff, here are my questions and comments:
Section II. A.  Do you think the 2.6 sentence is clear enough--meaning, they
couldn't take this to mean they have a 10% daily tolerance on their
nomination, just a 10% monthly nomination.
Section II.B.  4.1--As discussed, we need to add the words "LDC or interstate
pipeline" after the word applicable in the third to the last line.
Storage section:
Need to add a 5% tolerance to their monthly storage nomination.
Then, we need to add a mechanism to handle their being off from that first of
the month storage nomination.
The concept should be this:
If they are within 5% of their monthly storage nomination (in the paper pool
or bank in Ed McMichael's proposal) but not at exactly 100% of the
nomination, this volume variance will be rolled to another month and the
proxy schedule amended.  The parties must  mutually agree to the month the
hedges will roll to (protecting us if we have already rolled some hedges for
our own benefit), with the financial impact of these hedge changes being
borne by CES.
If they are outside the 5% monthly nomination, the volume outside the 5% will
be handled as follows:
If storage takes are less than 95% of the Monthly storage nomination, the
volume that falls in this category will be sold to ENA at the lower of (i)
the average of the five lowest current month prices as published in Gas Daily
for the applicable location; or (ii) the following month's Inside FERC or NGI
monthly index, as applicable, minus $.01.  If storage takes are greater than
105% of the Monthly storage nomination, that volume will be purchased by CES
at the greater of (i) the average of the five highest current month prices as
published in Gas Daily for the applicable location; or (ii) the following
month's Inside FERC or NGI monthly index, as applicable, plus $.01, plus any
applicable transportation and storage injection or withdrawal costs.
I have not proposed this exact process to Melissa yet, but I have left her a
message that I want to discuss this.   I'll let you know how that goes, but I
think this is a reasonable concept.  The only question is....will she think
so?
