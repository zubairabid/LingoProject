Attached you will find the brief we filed yesterday in the UC-CSU matter and
the declarations of several Enron people and an expert supporting our
positions.  The filing yesterday was only to oppose the universities' request
to shorten the briefing and hearing schedule on their motion for a
preliminary injunction.  Next step will be to file our opposition to the
motion for preliminary injunction, and the date for filing those documents
will be set by the court.  Please let us know if you have any questions.
