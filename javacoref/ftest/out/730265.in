Dear Colleagues:
This fall, I will be running in the Portland Maine Marathon to raise funds and awareness for Leukemia research and support for affected patients and their families.   Any contributions you are able to make to this worthy cause are much appreciated.   Please see attached for additional details.  Thank you very much in advance for your generous support.
