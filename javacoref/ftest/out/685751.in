After a week and a half of silence from Houston Street, I found out today
that they have taken over responsibility for their exchange linking
development from Sapient.  According to the Houston Street project manager,
Sapient was being too cautious and thorough in their efforts to get to market
and Houston Street wasn't impressed with their progress to date.  Sapient had
as of last week finished the design work for the system and has provided the
design to Houston Street.  Houston Street will use their own internal team to
complete the project and feels confident they will finish by the 15 January
deadline.

This does not bode well for the exchange that appeared to be light years
ahead of TrueQuote in their development efforts.
