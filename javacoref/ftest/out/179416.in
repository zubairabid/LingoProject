US Sens Unveil Bipartisan Bill To Cap Western Pwr Prices

WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--U.S. senators Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif, and Gordon
Smith, R-Ore., Tuesday unveiled bipartisan legislation to require federal
regulators to impose cost-based electicity price controls throughout the
western U.S..

The bill was unveiled at a press conference designed to ratchet up pressure
on the Bush administration to relent in its opposition to price controls in
response to a pending electricity supply crisis in the region this summer.

The measure would require the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
limit the prices power suppliers can obtain to their cost of production plus
a reasonable rate of return. The bill would allow FERC to determine what rate
of return power providers could obtain. The cost-based price controls would
remain in effect until March 1, 2003.

The bill also targets a FERC decision deemed to be exacerbating California's
electricity crisis by driving up natural gas costs in the state. It would
require FERC to end a temporary suspension of a natural gas transportation
rate cap for sales into California. The bill would mandate that natural gas
providers disclose to FERC commodity and transportation prices for sales into
California.
