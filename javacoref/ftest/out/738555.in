When: Tuesday, October 30, 2001 8:00 AM-8:30 AM (GMT-06:00) Central Time (US & Canada).
Where: Bubble Meeting Room

*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*

Finalize the presentation, review itinerary and who will be speaking to their respective areas--Asset Management, QSE Scheduling, Pricing of QSE Services, etc.

FYI:  I'm trying to set up a tour of the new building at 3pm--I don't feel that the presentation will take that long but this will allow us enough time (2-3pm) to present the information, get a tour & return for Q&A.  I suspect that on return from the tour we can discuss with ANP what we can do to close this QSE Services deal.
