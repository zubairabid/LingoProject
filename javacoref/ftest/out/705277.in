Kenny,
I received a note from Dave Schafer's office that they had received a note
from you that they thought should have come to me instead of Dave.  They were
correct.  Please take note, for future emails, that I am John Shafer and not
Dave Schafer.
Now, related to the essence of your email message below.  I am still in the
process of gather information related to the California Endangered Species
Act Memorandum or Understanding and Take Authorization as agreed to by the
Koch Oil Company and the California Department of Fish and Game on Jan. 2,
1998 (related to which Ed Attanasio has stated that such MOU and permit was
assigned to EOTT after the sale of the facilities to EOTT).   I am requesting
from Mr. Attanasio copies of the January 10 Annual Report that supposedly
have been filed by EOTT with the CDFG related to activities associated with
this MOU.  I am also holding conversations with Randi McCormick and Ed
Attanasio related to the status of the USFWS Federal Incidental Take Permit
issued to Arco Western Energy in March, 1996 covering the same properties.
Therefore, my comments are somewhat cursory at this point - but I'm getting
up to speed pretty fast on this very important issue.
We need to thoroughly understand what agreements are in place (both with the
CDFG and the USFWS) before we do something within this protected preserve to
one of these rare, threatened or endangered species that we will all live to
regret.  Everything may be perfect and all agency personnel happy as a "tree
frog in the middle of a swamp in August," but I'm not convinced yet that we
even know what these predecessors agreed to and why.
Some of the things I am aware of at this point:
The California MOU and Incidental Take Permit applies to the North Coles
Levee Natural Gas Fractionator Plant, Rogas Railcar facility, 250 miles of
existing pipeline, and 155 miles of proposed pipeline. (Caveat: Is this
project part of the 155 miles that has already been presented to the CDFG by
Koch or is this something outside that agreement?  Also, what about the US
Fish and Wildlife Service concerns over these species?  Where is the
agreement with the USFWS?  If there is not one done a full-blown
Environmental Impact Study will have to be performed to get the Section 7
consultation done under the Federal Endangered Specie Act!).
The North Coles Plant occupies 90 acres - right in the heart of the protected
preserve.
California Endangered species involved by the MOU and permit: 10 animals, 1
shrimp, 10 plants (all of these are also Federally Endangered).
California Protected species involved by the MOU and permit: 2 animals (these
are not listed by the Feds).
"Take Authorizations" are very restricted (another words, if you illegally
"take, kill, harrass, damage their habitat, etc." one of these plants or
animals - you go to jail and do not collect $200 when you pass go".
Notices of activities to the CDFG are very restrictive and must be precisely
completed prior to any ground disturbance.  In certain instances, prior to
any human intrusion into protected areas.
Orientation and training related to the species, permit, restrictions, etc.
must be done with all employees prior to entering a construction area.
Biologist must be on hand for all activities.
All covers on oil drains, pipes, pits, etc. must be maintained as to prevent
injury to wildlife.
Pre-activity survey work must be done before any off-road driving is done
(except in case of emergency).
Mitigation:  Permanent loss of habitat 3 to 1
Temporary loss of habitat 1.1 to 1
Compensation provided on annual basis in advance of year's activities
(Caveat: Has this been   done?)
All pipe will be inspected prior to moving it.
If a trapped or an injured animal is discovered, the CDFG is to be notified
immediately.
All trenches are to provide an escape route for animals (in steep wall trench
areas).
Lizards - in areas where the Blunt-Nosed Leopard Lizard are found, all
excavation is to be done by hand!  Daylight work only.
Revegetate with local stock.
Reports during and post construction must be timely as indicated in permit.
All other activities (regular maintenance during the year) are to be reported
on a January 10 Report filed with the CDFG stating the effectiveness of the
measures taken.
Koch was to establish a "Pledged Savings Account" or trust for the amount
needed to stand behind the activities undertaken during the year - until such
"Habitat Management Land" would be donated by Koch to mitigate for the
impacts that had occurred.  Also, Koch was to provide an "Endowment" to CDFG
for management of any new lands donated and pay all reasonable expenses.  (I
assume this also applies to EOTT now that EOTT is the owner).
Koch could proceed (under this State Permit) with ground disturbance
activities, prior to having the acreage to donate, as long as the savings
account and/or trust was set up and funded to cover the activities.
Any default and the permit is rescinded and the CDFG will bring all charges
(both corporate and individual).
Term - 25 years from Jan. 2, 1998.
(Caveat: A "Scott Clark" signed this agreement on behalf of Koch in 1998.  Is
this the same Scott Clark that now works for Randy Rice?
As you can see, I only know enough about this issue at this point to be
dangerous.  However, I would caution each and every one of you to proceed
with appropriate caution until we have all of the facts.  If we have a
problem with the proposed construction or with our daily maintenance
activities related to any of these species or this agreement, we will need to
have all the facts correctly identified and completed.
I am also attempting to have a conference call with most of you to discuss
this very important issue.
