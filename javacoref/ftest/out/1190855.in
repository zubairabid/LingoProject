To Jae- Moo,
1. Impressive P'point presentation indeed.
2. Friday Sep 1 - 800am TYO time is good for Australia, I will be attending
is there anything that i need to arrange at our end ??
3. After the successful roll-out of W for Japan & Oz thus qtr,
as discussed - we are ready to roll-out Korean W say in Mid October ???
Your email & presenatation thus arrived at a very good time.
4. Just some questions -
You may answer in the conference call or by email -- your choice
(a) why has W derivatives been singled out by FSC for potential review
when there is no regulation of eg LPG , or plastics swaps & fwds  ?  (pg 11
of presentation)
(b) How necessary are the meetings with ( pg 5 of presentation)
".. Bank of Korea (BOK)/ Ministry of Finance & Economy (MOFE) for
classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives.." ?
Is this meeting to meet
"...except for Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations (FETR) in case of
foreign currency trades
Classification of weather derivatives as commodity or financial derivatives
under FETR needs to be resolved..."(pg 15 of presentation)
Can we just do it first with Enron Korea as the counterparty ? If so , if
Korean coy transacts with Enron Korea,
there should be no problem in remitting funds wholly within Korea !
Also we intend to offer product in Won only so no FX involved at all .
(c)
pg 18 of presentation
'...All other EnronOnline products with the exception of bandwidth and
emission allowances are classified as commodity derivatives in Korea..."
Why is it bandwidth and emission are classified differently?
Will not Weather fall under same category ?
"...Commodity derivatives require a prior reporting to the Bank of Korea for
each trade .."
Is this only relevant if product is not in Won but foreign currency ?
5. pg 28 of presentation
Note that Dr Christian Werner - Sydney office will be the person for
"Data system   For weather derivative products, arrange with a weather
forecasting company for the weather data feed - timing depends on the
location"
We will be able to assist with (if reqd, see points 4b & c above)
"...  For weather derivatives, arrange presentation meetings with BOK/MOFE
for classification of weather derivatives as commodity derivatives
_ May require longer time for their decision making
Korea Office, Mike Dahlke, EOL Weather specialist (?)"
