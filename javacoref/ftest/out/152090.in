transportation documents are signed. The PA states that Kern will tender the
transport agreement no later than 30 days prior to the date Kern files their

Kern will want to file this application ASAP - sometime in April.

I have a 9:30 meeting with Gerald to prepare the assignment documents - can
we conference then?
