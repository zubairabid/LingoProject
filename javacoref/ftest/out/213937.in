1  I have left voice messages for Alfredo, Paul Dawson, and Paul Hennemeyer
(but have not heard back from any of the three), and have spoken to Peter
Styles and Doug Wodd, so we can go with whatever is agreed.
2  I have made a change as we discussed about geographic responsibility,
given my conversation with you that I think it is a bit misleading to only
show these people (in many areas) being responsible for "Power", when in fact
they are responsible for "Gas", too.  Doug is really responsible for gas as
an adjunct to their local efforts, as well as a change to indicate, also as
we discussed, that these responsibilites are flexible, in response to
changing commercial priorities, as well as the need to support the other
Wholesale businesses.
