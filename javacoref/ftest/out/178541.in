Rick. Let's pause and reflect on this bullet. Do we want to argue for that?
This is going to start another Federal/State rights war!! and I do not
believe this is going to help much and would require legislation.
Federal siting and permitting authority must be expanded to allow for the
construction of new transmission and generation facilities.
Maybe in some less populated states, or for sitting facilities in the middle
of no-where this is not a problem, but my experience in Florida is that the
sitting process is very much intertwined with property rights and ROW
acquisition, ultimately relying on condemnation.  To get there, in Florida
there is a process  to establish that there was a "public need" that required
government action.   At FPL we relied on the process to obtain an eventual
outcome where there was the force-of- law [of the greater public good to be
able to obtain the ROW].  This was crucial for the  Transmission ROW for all
lines greater than 240 KV. (Many more individual owners and 100% needed to
complete the connection within the selected route).   The sitting process for
the generation site was not as controversial, because we acquired  (or held
rights to) sites which had been pre-screened to avoid controversy; but,
obviously a permit for a generation site is useless if you can't get the
power into the grid, thus you need the Transmission ROW.
Part of the process involved providing options/ and costs, community
involvement, etc.  - which ultimately resulted in a "choice"  determined to
have been "prudently" undertaken, ( Longer much costly line, part
underground, etc,)
In every case, there were "not in my back-yard" arguments, at times disguised
as an EMF issue. Also, in every case, the authorities knew that they had to
select one option, or make one on their own. Not selecting one meant that
there would be power shortages and they would have to answer to the people
impacted, the local voters.
Under the regulatory framework, where there will be concurrent filings for
competing projects, the determination of "public need" will be more difficult
to acertain. You may end up having an approval but not being able to use the
condemnation process to get the ROW. But, still, I have a hard time believing
that the Federal process would be an improvement over the State process
(except in California where they have truly lived-up to their reputation).
