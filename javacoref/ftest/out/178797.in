Jeff--you did such a good job that I don't have to type much.   I do have a
few other thoughts to share that may be helpful for the California folks.
The format, although somewhat informal, had a  court reporter present and
transcripts will be published. Each state was invited to have 2
representatives and one of the 2 had to be a Commission member.  Opening
comments were taken from each state and then specific topics were discussed.
Herzberg participated primarily in the opening discussion.
He came across as very sincere---indicated that they were working "around the
clock" to take care of their problems, but that they cannot do it alone.  He
asked for FERC to help get Califonia to "stabilization" and specifically
asked FERC for three actions:  an 18 month temporary price cap on
electricity,  an 18 month temporary price cap on natural gas prices and to
prohibit any withholding of pipeline capacity to California.
He was treated very respectfully (which was not as evident  in the comments
to Commissioner Brown), and I think he did his cause some good.  Much more so
that in other venues when I've seen other reps from Davis's office speak.
Breathitt came to California's defense at some point in the discussion.
Commissioner Brown did his share of ranting about EVERYBODY knowing that
market manipulation is taking place and that the bastards were going to pay
for their misdeeds (ok..he didn't use those words, but his message was clear)
Lastly, the Chair of the Montana was the most vocal and honest in his
comments to the California partcipants stating, in part,  "why should Montana
ratepayers be taking the hit because California didn't build power plants."
