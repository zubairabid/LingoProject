The following individuals have been identified for the training/knowledge sharing that was discussed at this week's meeting.

Randy Bryan, Mike Bodnar, Legale Black, Richard Hanagriff, Alice Johnson, Dennis Lee and Jim Studebaker

As discussed, the session will cover the following:
1.  Inventory of commonly used Universes and their data structure (4 hours)
2.  Description of the canned reports that currently exist and how they are being used.  (2 hours)
3.  Q&A and assistance in developing reports (2 hours).  This was not discussed but I think this would be a valuable use of time.

The GL directors agreed that along with notifying these individuals that they will receive further Business Objects training, they are to bring a list of needed reports from their respective areas to develop in the days (or weeks) immediately following the class.

Gas Logistics goal is to develop individuals that can create complex reports using Business Objects and reduce its reliance on IT and Don in developing such reports.

Please let us know when you think you will be able to hold the session.  Our expectation on timing is within the next six weeks.  Mike Bodnar will be the "lead" from Gas Logisitics so please rely on him for support.
