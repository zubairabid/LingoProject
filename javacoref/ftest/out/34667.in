Event  Profile

In this painstaking depiction of  Pittsburgh in the `70s, Wilson exposes the nobility and corruption of the human  spirit ravaged by racism, poverty, death, longing, even alcoholism. Five men  working for a car service struggle to realize their (sometimes unformed) dreams  and stumble upon revolutionary ire along the way.
While the central  conflict rests between the cab station's owner and his ex-convict son, Wilson's  egalitarian spirit ensures that every character has his piece to say.
Hip  but pointed dialogue alternates with soul-bearing and comic monologues. Whatever  the tone, these soliloquies are seized with gusto.
