Jeff and Kath:
Well, I did not fair too well this weekend in regard to fundraising for the
desk.  Here is the report:
Gail and Louis Adler declined saying that they loved the desk, think it is
important for the museum etc. but that they did not want to be part of a
group.  They said that if something arose in the furuture that was more
reasonable and that they could do alone that they might be interested in
helping.
Cyvia and Melvyn Wolff also declined.  Cyvia said that they were quite torn
because it made sense due to their furniture connections and how important
the desk is but ultimately they want their fund to grow into something and
if they dedicate it to the desk there will be nothing left.
I am still trying to reach Nina and Michael.
Margaret Skidmore is meeting with Susan Borches from Shell on the 28th so we
may get a sense there.  Maybe we should coordinate a pitch with Margaret
when she gets back.  Perhaps a call to Mr. Miller might be a good idea (?).
That is all for now.  If you have any reports or any new suggestions, please
let me know.
Thanks,
cindi
