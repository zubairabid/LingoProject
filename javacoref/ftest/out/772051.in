John,  I've rewritten the beginning of this notice to be more consistent with the posting we did for the Bushton shut down and receipt of C6+ gas in Jan etc.
"Northern has been notified by ElPaso that the nitrogen level being delivered at the Keystone Interconnect (POI 169) exceeded their tariff specification on October 11, 2001 and as a result gas was not confirmed for delivery to them at that point.  Northern has reviewed the gas composition for the receipts in the area, and gas received by Northern with a high nitrogen content in this area may not be confirmed for receipt or curtailed, if previously scheduled, in accordance with gas quality specifications in section 44 of Northern's tariff.  If this becomes necessary, the points listed below will be allocated or curtailed in the following order based on the gas stream compostion.    List"
Insert your list, but We don't understand how this relates to Spraberry Area and Hobbs Area, what are the points???
Please call if you have any questions.
