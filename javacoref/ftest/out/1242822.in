I have been working closely with OneOk Westex this month in order to balance their OBA at Reeves and to date we are still approximately 17,000 dth over delivered to them.

Gary Spraggins approved and OneOk agreed to NNG set the flow control to them at 2,000 dth less that their scheduled to make this up for rest of the month.

Roy Armitage in NNG Gas Control was contacted and has made the adjustments.

Any questions, please call.
