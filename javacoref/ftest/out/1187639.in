We have not decided "to prevent any regulated utility from completing any
financial transactions" online.  If we have already satisfactorily concluded
the necessary due diligence with respect to a particular utility, they will
be approved.  It is only with respect to those utilities which have not yet
been researched that we are withholding approval.  The due diligence required
involves asking the utility for certain information concerning their
organization and regulatory situation, hiring local counsel in the relevant
state and having research done into the laws and regulations in place there
and into any public utility commission orders respecting the particular
utility in question, and on occasion requesting an opinion letter from the
utility's counsel.  We usually begin that process only when a trader believes
there is a likelihood of a sufficient volume of trading with the utility to
justify the time and expense.  FYI, the due diligence process has in the past
revealed circumstances which prevented the utility from trading derivatives
or required actions to authorize such trading which had not been taken.

A recent count showed about 10 executed master agreements and another 30 to
40 in one stage or another of the due diligence/negotiation process.
