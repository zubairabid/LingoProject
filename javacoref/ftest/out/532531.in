PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.
