I understand that the decision was made to not comment due to customer
relations concerns.  This is probably wise.

My take on our deals with interruptible customers is that we priced deals
assuming that the customer would stay on an interruptible rate schedule and
abide by the terms of that schedule and all tariff rules for that schedule
through the expiration date of the schedule on March 31, 2002 (per PU Code
Section 743.1).  These interruptible programs are programs administered by
the local distribution company based on  decisions to interrupt from the
ISO.  As I understand, the decisions to interrupt is based on system
reliability issues, thereby justifying recovery of the cost of the program
from all customers whom benefit from system reliability.  The customers
decision to contract with the LDC to be on an interruptible schedule, and in
some cases contract with an ESP under the assumption that the customer
remains on the schedule, is primarily an issue between the customer and the
LDC.  If a customer elects to not abide by the terms of the rate schedule,
the customer should be responsible for the consequences.  Hopefully, are
contract language specifies that the customer must pay the penalties for
defaulting on rules for interruptible service.  I don't know how tight are
contract language is with respect to the expectation to stay on interruptible
service through March 31, 2002 and passing through penalties.  If one of
customers elect to leave the interruptible schedule before March 31, 2002, I
presume this would be grounds for nullifying the contract or renegotiating
the contract.

In addition to the system reliability reasons for curtailing, it looks like
the utilities, ISO, and CPUC, are looking for curtailment programs as
demand-responsiveness programs in order to mitigate purported supply-side
market power and reduce prices to California.  Under the current crisis, this
is a good thing.  The question is who pays for these programs.  I have heard
arguments that all loads should pay, since all loads benefit from the
externalities of lower prices from lower demands.  This is only true for
those loads be supplied by the spot market.  On the other hand, we have made
the argument that only those customers that directly benefit should pay for
the cost of the program.  In other words, a program for SO customers should
be funded by SO customers, because the cost of programs sponsored by ESPs for
DA customers are not recovered from SO customers.  I think that we need to
divide this issue into a 2001 solution and longer-term solution.  Arguable,
the 2001 and perhaps 2002 solutions are to benefit all load, including DA, so
long as the current rate freeze structure is maintained.  However, in a
post-freeze structure, the policy should probably be that only those who
directly benefit should pay.  Another long-term policy guideline should be
based on participation.  In other words, eligibility of participation should
also determine whether DA customers should also pay for the program.


Direct Benefits	Eligible to Participate	Who pays
LDC Administered Program to address System Reliability	All Customers	All Customers with the proper
metering and telemetry	All Customers
LDC Administered Program to address economic conditions under current market
conditions and current rate freeze structure	All Customers so long as the rate freeze
is maintained and prices are high?	SO customers with proper metering and telemetry	If all
Customers, must pay, then the program should accommodate participation by DA
customers as well
LDC in a default provider role administered program to address post-freeze
economic conditions	SO Customers	SO Customers	SO Customers
ESP Administered Program to address post-freeze economic conditions	DA Customer	DA Customer	DA Customer

It is important to make the distinction in what capacity is the LDC
administering interruptible programs, as seen above.  Also, it is important
to understand the role of SCs and the ISO.  SCs are just the vehicle by which
ESPs and wholesale marketers implement  DA curtailment programs and
participate in ISO and PX markets for energy and ancillary services.  The
ISO, like the utilities, wears two hats.  The ISO implements directions to
the LDCs to curtail based on a last resort need to curtail.  The ISO is also
trying to develop market solutions involving SCs and the LDC in their role as
a default provider, in order to avoid having to issue general directions to
utilities to curtail.  The utility similarly tries to first use interruptible
rate schedules, then as a last resort relies on rolling blackouts.  It may be
important to determine what category do new LDC programs fit into in the
shortrun and the longrun.

What are our plans to participate and help California clearly define these
issues?  Any thoughts?
