1:30pm sounds fine. Where do you sit?

Also, just to confirm, we are looking for:
1. Table/list of gas curves and their primary, secondary and parent relationships;
2. Volatility curve table/list for gas; methodology for system calculation of correlation
3. Volumetric poistion data by curve for gas as of 11/30/01

Thanks,
Mike
