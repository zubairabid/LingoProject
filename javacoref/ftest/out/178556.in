One obvious question that comes to mind is:  will the tax apply to the
"windfall" reaped by the utilities from their "retained" generation and will
it also include state and federal "public" power authorities (e.g., LADWP,
WAPA, etc.).  I don't think that the IOUs can absorb any more costs right
about now.
Do we have any information on whether the Ds intend to grandstand this bill
on the same dates that the "special" committee (Dunn?) will be holding its
investigative hearings into wholesale power prices?
