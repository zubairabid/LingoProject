I have not had time to really delve into the details of the plan but thought
I would let you know that the Market Stabilization Plan will have a big
impact on your business practices, just as 10-minute settlements did.  We
realize the pain 10 minute settlements brought, and continues to bring, and
we've expressed that any future changes needs to be done in a more pragmatic
manner.  I can only keep my fingers crossed.  Anyway, the implementation
date is June 1, so I thought I would send this out as a heads up.  I'm also
attached the filing.    Keep in mind that this is a detailed narrative and
the ISO believes that FERC will issue its order regarding market power
mitigation within the next 1-2 weeks, which would incorporate their review
of the narrative filing.  Specific tariff language would then be completed
and filed.
