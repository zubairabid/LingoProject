Gentlemen,

Per our conversation earlier this afternoon, attached are the following referenced materials:

1)  "Shapiro Update" -- prepared prior to today's conference call with latest contact and status info

2)  "JH Jose LNG" -- prepared and presented to Bollenger/Delahunt staffers last week for their trip to Caracas

3)  "LamedaLetter" -- prepared and sent to General Lameda after meeting with him, Vicenzo Paglione, and Nelson Nave in Caracas on July 6

4)  "JoseCriticalTimingMemo06-27" -- prepared and sent to Nelson Nava and others in PDVSA Gas prior to July 6 meeting with Lameda, et al

5)  "JoseChavezCallMemoJune25" -- prepared as briefing memo to Ken Lay in anticipation of arranging a call between him and President Chavez; attached to it as further background is an older project description memo

6)  "Jose LNG Background Chavez Call" -- a slightly earlier version of the Lay prep memo for the President Chavez call that shows some additional info and a slightly different approach to the pitch in the call;  I still think the later version is preferable, but thought you might find the contrast and additional info useful

You may also be interested to know that there is a CERA decision brief dated August 2001 discussing some of the political/project development issues we discussed with you today.  Please advise if you think this would be useful.

Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or require any further information.
