Having watched the whole string of e-mails on this issue, I fully agree with Andy's observations and those of others who have made similar statements. In response to Andy's(and Dave Perrino's) question as to whether we respond to the BS of NERC, absolutely..We should call them on this shameless use of an American tragedy...we should correct them on the facts and use this as an opportunity to highlight their inexcusable and baseless  manipulation of the WTC tragedy. NERC ought to be ashamed of itself.
