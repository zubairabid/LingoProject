significantly less on an annual basis, $2.66 B per annum vesus $4.2 B to
$4.4B per annum shown before.  This difference can largely be explained by
the fall-off in spot curves which explains $1.3 B per annum of the decrease.
All eyes will be on the utility's generation rate cases at CPUC on their
retained gen, QF and billaterals.
