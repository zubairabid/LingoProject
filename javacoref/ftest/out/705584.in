The answer to your question is that all emissions reported on the emissions
inventory should be included in the calculation of emissions fees. This leads
to another question-what emissions should be reported on the emissions
inventory?

I discussed this issue with a TNRCC emissions inventory team leader. He
informed me that that is no written guidance on how to report upset,
maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions on the emissions inventory, and
as a result be included in emission fees. He did indicate that at previous
emissions inventory workshops, attendees were verbally told to only include
"reportable" (emissions that exceed RQ) on their inventories, and not
"recordable" (non-reportable) emissions. He also mentioned that one ton/year
would also be an acceptable threshold for including emissions in the
inventory.

He is aware that  upset, maintenance, start-up, and shutdown emissions are an
important issue, now that they are included in fees. He indicated that TNRCC
will be putting out definitive information on this issue in future emissions
inventory workshops and guidance, in preparation for submittal of calendar
year 2001 inventories that will be due in 2002.
