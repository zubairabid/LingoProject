WE HAVE A DEAL!

Attached are the final communication materials.  The only changes are the addition of legend language at the end of the external Q&A, employee email, messages and talking points, and a change in one question in the external and internal Q&A (Q: When will the 10Q be filed? A: It is scheduled to be filed on November 14.)

Please forward these materials to your direct reports as briefing materials for floor/staff meetings.  We will run the ETV ad notifying employees to check their email for an important video message through the weekend and Monday morning.  Call me if you have any questions.

Thank you all for your assistance in communicating these messages with employees.
