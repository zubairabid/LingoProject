A PHC was held in San Diego yesterday on the investigation into markets.

Wood is the Assigned Commissioner in the Investigation.  He's held one
quasi-legislative hearing with hand-picked panelist in San Diego.  He intends
to hold 3 others.  Panelist will be invited to participate.  I understand
that the generators, who are not parties to the proceeding, have been
subpoened by the CPUC to provide their generating information, which was
supplied on Monday of this week.

This is shaping up in a very bad direction.  In addition to the "hand-picked"
panels, only Wood, the ALJ and other Commissioners can ask questions.  The
record could be developed to support the view point of roll-back to
regulation.  This also could be used by the legislature next session.

I will be getting the ALJ's ruling on the questions the Commission would like
to have answered.  We have not been contacted to participate in any panel, as
of yet.

We may need to turn up the heat (PR?) on the process issues in this
proceeding.  It is shaping up to be a sham investigation.

I will forward pertinent portions of the transcript when available.
