I agree with Teb.
In addition, under Section 11 (Sheet No.l22A), you get "Section 11 rights" (ability to shift entitlements between points) only if all of the points are under one contract.  That is not the case here.  Therefore, the Section 11 rights could not apply.  Further, the dpoa would not give Section 11 rights, as Chris seems to believe.
Now, the question arises "If we allow FPU to combine these two contracts, can they get Section 11 rights?"  First, the two contracts would have to be under the same rate schedule (either FTS-1 or FTS-2 for SFTS).  Second, the New Smyrna Point would have to qualify as a "division" (as Teb points out) or as a "plant" (as Section 11 provides).  Third, we would have to treat all shippers the same in allowing the combining of contracts.
With regard to the third point, I understand from Jim S. that we allowed Peoples to combine a West Florida contract (acquired through a permanent release) with their existing contract, so that Section 11 rights extended to the new point(s).
