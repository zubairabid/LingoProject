I understand from Smith Day that APX forwarded us today a format of contract relating to their potentially serving as QSE for UBS AG trading.  APX is apparently willing to contract on a month-to-month basis (thus allowing us to move to our own IT interface with ERCOT as soon as possible).

As to item two below, until UBS would have the IT capability (currently under development and projected to be roughly a month from completion) to become certified to act as its own QSE, it would not need to execute any 'market participant' agreement with ERCOT in order to be a power marketer within ERCOT.  As soon as UBS desired to trade Renewable Energy Credits ("RECs"), it would need to sign a standard-form agreement with ERCOT in order to maintain a REC account.

Trading conducted by UBS with any given counterparty within ERCOT would be pursuant to 'UBSWarburgEnergyOnline' GTCs or else subject to discrete negotiated wholesale power enabling agreements and/or ISDA master agreements. The ERCOT ISO would have no connection with such relationship documents supporting UBS AG trading activities.  On the other hand, as UBS's likely counterparties are entities with wholesale power trading activities of national scope, the timeline for trading in ERCOT is linked to the timeline for completing wholesale power/financial master enabling agreements approved by UBS.  Doug Gilbert-Smith this afternoon identified the following counterparties in decreasing order of of their priority as trading partners in ERCOT:

TXU Energy Trading
BP Energy Company
Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
Aquila Power Corporation
Morgan Stanley capitral Group
Constellation Power Source
FPL Energy Power Marketing, Inc.
American Electic Power Service Corporation
Mirant Americas Energy Marketing, LP
Calpine Energy Servicces LP
Dynegy Marketing & Trade
LCRA --Lower Colorado River Authority

along with a couple of incumbent utilities:

San Antonio City Public Service
Reliant HL&P

If you desire Doug Gilbert -Smith to sit in on this meeting, then it would have to be scheduled for Thursday.
