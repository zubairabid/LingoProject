FYI. Aquilla's plan is described below.
I talked with Martin Chavez at Kiodex and he confirmed as well.
I think the bigger issue is that other enterprises are starting to try to build businesses around their systems and operations.  I think we have a good head start with CommodityLogic and Kiodex but we have to run even faster now.
