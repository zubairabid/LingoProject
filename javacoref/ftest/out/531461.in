FROM KERRY STROUP AND ROY BOSTON

Roy Boston and I have been asked to coordinate communications regarding NARUC
activities and Enron Government Affairs staff.  Our goal is to foster an
effective presence at NARUC, and to facilitate direct communications of Enron
viewpoints when appropriate at committee and staff subcommittee meetings.

This memo is a reminder to all that the NARUC (National Association of
Regulatory Utility Commissioners) Summer Meeting is on the horizon.
Commissioners representing US states, federal agencies and international
members will be in attendance.

NARUC will hold its annual Summer Meeting in Seattle, Washington, from July
15-18.  Before June 22, registration fees are $400 for industry
representatives; thereafter they are $450.  An on-line registration form is
available at http://www.naruc.org. That site also provides information on
hotel accommodations and (in theory) on committee and sub-committee agendas.
Many of the committees have not yet developed their agendas, but some
preliminary information is available.  That information is  summarized below
and available at the same website address.  As we receive additional agenda
information, it will be disseminated to you.
