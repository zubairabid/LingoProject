Hello brothers,

Beaver football is amazing this year!  Next weekend is Homecoming and
presents a great opportunity for us all to visit the Teke house and all the
new members who we have not yet met.  The house has strong membership
numbers and is very present on campus.  We are definitely on the upswing!
What we can improve on is our Alumni support.  I know that going back and
not knowing anyone at the house is frustrating, but that is more the reason
to get over and learn their names and faces.  After talking with several
Tekes who graduated in the past few years, we decided that instead of
waiting for the house to ask us for support we would like to raise money
ourselves and purchase a new Big Screen TV for the Teke house basement.  The
old TV is just about dead and this is a great way to help out the house (not
to mention a good reason to go over to the house).  We are hoping to
surprise them THIS Saturday morning before the game.  We are asking for a
minimum donation of $50 dollars.  We would need about 30 people to make this
happen, so are you going to step up and support Your house?  I am personally
going to give $100 and I have two other members who have pledged the same.
Please help us make this happen.  You can write a check to ME or to TKE.  We
do not want the house knowing about this until we are sure that it is going
to happen.  So send the checks to me and please write back or call me to let
me know that you will supporting this before FRIDAY at NOON.  Thank you for
all you participate and those of you who do not, let me know how I can get
your support on future efforts!

Yours in the Bond,
