All -

I have attached my updated distribution list for our summer interns who received offers at the end of the summer.  Below is their current status:

Candidates Receiving Full Time Offers:
Cathy Wang - Accept
Kruti Patel - Accept
Vinay Adenwala - Accept
Daniel Payne - Decline (due to location)
Amy Mohan - Decline (plans to attend law school)

Please welcome Cathy, Kruti, and Vinay to Enron!

(Amy Mohan interned at Enron for 2 summers and has decided to attend law school upon graduation.  She was a great performer and we hope to see her back at Enron upon receiving her law degree!  Daniel Payne simply decided that he would rather work in the New York area.)

Candidates Receiving Offers for Summer 2002 Internships:
Vivek Shan - 11/1/01 deadline
Ainsley Gaddis - 11/1/01 deadline
Rachel Ravanzo - 11/1/01 deadline
Michelle Yee - 11/1/01 deadline

As you can see, the candidates receiving offers for repeat internships have yet to accept.  Your contact is extremely important at this stage!  Please make contact with them and SELL Enron!

Since we are at the closing stage with these candidates, please keep me informed and let me know when you contact them.

Let me know if I can provide any additional information.

Thanks!
