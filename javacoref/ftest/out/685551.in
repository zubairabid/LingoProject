In his email a few days ago dealing with the newly adopted WPTF principles for RTO formation, Gary Ackerman wrote that:

"Dan Douglass will utilize this document to review the WestConnect filing, and in combination with members' comments on the same, prepare a briefing to the Board in a special teleconference Board Meeting that we will hold on Wednesday morning, October 31 (Halloween) at 11 a.m."

So far, no members have sent me any of their comments on the filing.  It would be greatly appreciated should some of you do so before next week.  Thanks!

Dan
