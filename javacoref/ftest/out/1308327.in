The results of the PM's visit to Washington and, with it, the opportunity for a dialogue between the two governments on Dabhol were disappointing, to say the least.
As the PM was arriving White House lawyers made a determination that neither the President nor Larry Lindsey could speak to the Dabhol situation.  It was decided that Condi Rice would raise the issue with Mishra when they met on Thursday but she unfortunately did not.  The GOI apparently raised Dabhol in the Lindsey meeting but all he could do was hear them out and then explain that he could not discuss the issue.  Great impression!
The PMO Secretary refused to meet with me once he learned no one from Houston could come up.
OPIC is furious about the outcome.  OPIC leadership knows the project is about to be dropped in their lap.  We will be meeting in the next several days as they are travelling but I have already broached the idea that OPIC should approve a move to termination preemptively.  They understand where we are coming from but preliminarily are looking at a trip to India to meet with the GOI and explain what lies before them.  We also discussed their need to get clarification from the NSC as to where Dabhol stands in their list of priorities.  OPIC has to bring along the other parts of the Administration and it is unclear where they stand in light of the past week. Once Larson is back from Doha we will meet and sort out where State is on pressing the issue.
All in all a good opportunity lost. Standard fare for a terrible week.  ohn
