I was on a MAIN Planning Committee conference call this morning concerning Electric System Security.  This a technical group so I was probably overlooked as being a marketer.  Naturally the discussion revolved around potential targets and how to protect them from terrorist attacks.  The part that was disturbing was their desire to severely limit information that is currently in the public domain.  I relayed that I understood the need to protect critical grid components but limiting all information was equally damaging economically.  Some comments made implied that "you can't tell who has the information with marketers because they change jobs so much" and "you need to keep info from people with loose lips"  There was no direct comment linking marketers and loose lips, but the whole undertone was that information might not be as safe with marketers.  I have asked Andy to work with on a response to MAIN MIC and NERC.
