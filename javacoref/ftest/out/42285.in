This afternoon I called Mike Stoll at MRT to update him on Enron's progress in getting Creditor Committee approval for the permanent release of the EES and EEM transport contracts.  Mike said that after additional internal discussions, MRT had decided to file a Motion with the bankruptcy court on Monday just to make sure that they get in the queue to get a decision made.  The Motion will request that Enron be compelled to accept or reject the contracts by a specified date.  This is a change from MRT's earlier position.  It appears that MRT is following PGT (PGE-NW) strategy.

I asked whether the Motion would be filed in the morning or the afternoon.  He said he did not know.  I told him that if everything went well today with the approval process, Enron would probably be able to get the instruction letter to MRT on Monday.  He said he would pass the information to their upper management.  He did not know if this update would impact their decision of if or when MRT files.

II believe that if we can notify them that it has been approved by early on Monday, that we may be able to prevent the Motion being filed.

Any news yet?
