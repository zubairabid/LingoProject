I would like to take this opportunity to thank each of you for your
participation in the Stanford Associate interviews last week.  Our efforts
resulted in 6 summer associate offers and 1 full-time associate offer.
Althea Gordon will be e-mailing you the names of the individuals who will
receive offers.  We would like you to contact these individuals to
congratulate them and encourage their acceptance.  Althea will match you up
with the candidates you interviewed and provide you with contact information.

Althea has verbally contacted both the offers and the declines.  We will be
sending out both offer letters and decline letters by end of day Tuesday,
March 20.  In the meantime, should any of you be contacted by students who
did not receive an offer, I recommend the following verbal response:

"Our summer program is highly competitive, forcing us to choose a smaller
number of candidates from a highly qualified pool.  Our summer hiring this
year will be between 35-40 associates.  The full-time program typically hires
between 80-90 associates.  Given that you made it this far in our selection
process, I would strongly encourage you to apply in the fall for the
full-time associate program."

We will keep you informed via e-mail of our acceptance rate at Stanford.

Again, thank you for your support.  We look forward to working with you on
potential future Stanford recruiting events.

Regards,
Celeste Roberts
