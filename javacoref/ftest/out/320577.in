John:
The changes I suggested on the watercraft wording are still being reviewed
for completeness. I think what I gave you will work for most situations where
the watercraft is incidental to the work or is far removed from our being
involved [contractor to sub to sub contractor] but it does not address every
situation that we could be involved in. We may need to expand our wording
accordingly.

Likewise, your question on giving to the turbine venders the waiver of
subrogation and additional insured is an even bigger concern. You are asking
us to obligate ourselves in providing waiver and additional insured status to
GE which we cannot do.   As you know, we went many years with providing
turbine venders protection under the insurance because the market was soft
and underwriters agreed to it. Now they balk at giving it because of the
losses they have incurred and we cannot predict what they will agree to. It
does not matter if the machines are proto-type or not, there is a good chance
right now that they will not agree to insuring the vender. Everyone says it
only takes money and in many cases we could probably include venders on the
insurance but I cannot recommend committing to it in a long term contract )
we have to arrange the insurance at the time we need it in order to determine
if it is available.

If you need to have some language in the agreement, I would recommend that we
not give the waive and additional insured to GE or any vender. When we need
the insurance and begin placing it, we can then determine if the underwriter
will cover the vender and ask for a price reduction from GE to move their
risk to the underwriter.

I am sorry I cannot make this easier but that is the nature of the insurance
beast.
