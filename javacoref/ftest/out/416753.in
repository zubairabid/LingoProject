Carol,

1. We have set up the Master User from Aquila Risk under Utilicorp.  We do
not require any further paperwork from them, however, we do need them to set
up their sub-users.  I am going to follow up with Angela Webber at Utilicorp
tomorrow to make sure that sub users are set up.

2. I will notify you once sub-user accounts have been set up and then wait
for your instructions as to when we will shut Aquila Risk down for trading.

Thanks,
Stephanie x33465
