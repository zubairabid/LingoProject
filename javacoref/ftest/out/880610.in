At the CEC meeting today, the Commission did NOT adopt the Draft Final Report on Natural Gas Infrastructure Issues in order to give staff additional time to review further comments received from SoCal, Edison and others.  In the draft report distributed earlier this month you may recall that the report clearly indicates that the state utilties need to build additional intrastate capacity to provide take away capacity from the border and more closely match current and projected interstate pipeline capacity.  Lad Lorenz on behalf of  SoCal spoke at the meeting reiterating their viewpoint that they currently have sufficient backbone transmission facilities however he offered that the issue of getting customers to commit to long-term contracts should be added to the report as a basis for increasing capacity.  A spokeman for Edison stated that while the report mentions the possibility that market manipulation may have contributed towards the high gas prices during the last heating season, they would like to see the report reflect that market manipulation in fact did in part, cause higher prices and he went on to cite the El Paso FERC proceeding as substantiation for this position.  Given these comments, the adoption of the report was delayed until staff has had a chance to conduct further analysis.  Most likely it will be on the agenda in Sept.
