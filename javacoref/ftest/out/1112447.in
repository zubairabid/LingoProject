We have a call set up with the PwC auditors for Friday September 7 at 10:30 a.m.  The call-in number is (877) 661-1222 and the passcode number is 921065.

Richard, Mark, and Sue:  Any suggestions for increasing the likelihood that the auditors will pursue our questions?  I was thinking that we could get the names of the auditors and send them a confirming letter thanking them for meeting with us, reiterating our questions and concerns, and stating that we look forward to and relying on their review of these critical matters because so much money is at stake.  PwC will be less likely to blow us off with a letter like that in the file---if the ISO blows up, that letter would be Exhibit A in a negligent misrepresentation case against PwC.

Alan,

Would you like to meet on Thursday afternoon for a bit to outline and frame our questions?

Steve
