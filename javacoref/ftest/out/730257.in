MAPP has incorporated the EEI Master  Agreement as their membership tariff.  See attached.  They would  EEI and NEM's ok to do this since the tariff is derived from our document.   They have retained most of the core language from the EEI, but have added  various tariff related provisions and a new Schedule Q for MAPP related  products.  I'd be interested in folks feedback on this.
