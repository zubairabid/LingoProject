Here is the PG&E 10-K disclosure, which does not help much.
Under AB 1890, when the Utility has recovered its eligible transition
costs, the conditions for terminating the rate freeze and ending the
transition period will have been satisfied. At August 31, 2000, consistent
with transition period accounting mechanisms adopted by the CPUC, the Utility
credited its TCBA by $2.1 billion, the amount by which a negotiated $2.8
billion hydroelectric generation asset valuation exceeded the aggregate book
value of such assets. Based on this credit, the Utility believes it recovered
its eligible transition costs during August 2000. At August 31, 2000, there
was a balance of approximately $2.2 billion of undercollected wholesale power
costs recorded in the TRA. If the final valuation for the hydroelectric assets
is greater than $2.8 billion, as the Utility expects, the Utility believes it
will have recovered its transition costs possibly as early as May 2000. The
undercollected TRA balance as of the end of the earlier determined transition
period will be less than the $2.2 billion August 31, 2000 balance and could be
zero depending on the ultimate valuation of the hydroelectric assets and when
the transition period actually ends. Under current CPUC decisions and AB 1890,
the Utility's customers are responsible for wholesale power purchase costs
after the Utility has recovered its transition costs.
In one of its March 27, 2001 decisions, the CPUC adopted TURN's proposal to
transfer on a monthly basis the balance in each utility's TRA to the utility's
TCBA. The accounting changes are retroactive to January 1, 1998. The Utility
believes the CPUC is retroactively transforming the undercollected power
purchase costs in the TRA into transition costs in the TCBA. However, the CPUC
characterized the accounting changes as merely reducing the prior revenues
recorded in the TCBA, thereby affecting only the amount of transition cost
recovery achieved to date. The CPUC also ordered that the utilities restate
and record their generation memorandum accounts balances to the TRA on a
monthly basis before any transfer of generation revenues to the TCBA. The CPUC
found that based on the accounting changes, the conditions for meeting the end
of the rate freeze have not been met.
The Utility believes the adoption of TURN's proposed accounting changes
results in illegal retroactive ratemaking and constitutes an unconstitutional
taking of the Utility's property, and violates the federal filed rate
