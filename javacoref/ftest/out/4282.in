Energy Secretary Names Bonneville Head

WASHINGTON, DC -- Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced
today the appointment of Steve Wright as administrator of the Bonneville
Power Administration (BPA).  BPA is a federal agency that markets wholesale
electrical power, principally from federal dams in the Columbia Basin, and
operates high voltage transmission for the region.  It is based in Portland,
Oregon, and serves Washington, Idaho, Oregon, western Montana and small
parts of contiguous states.

"Bonneville is extremely important to maintaining a vital economy and
healthy environment in the Pacific Northwest, and I have confidence it will
continue to do so under Steve Wright's direction," said Secretary Abraham.
"Steve exerted outstanding leadership through some of the most turbulent
times for the electricity industry and has effectively worked with diverse
constituencies in the region," added Abraham.

Wright has been with the agency for 21 years, beginning in the agency's
conservation department.  He has served as acting administrator since
November 2000 following the departure of then-Administrator Judi Johansen.
Wright's tenure has spanned some of the region's biggest energy
challenges--including a West Coast energy crisis and the second worst
drought recorded in Pacific Northwest history.

Wright said he was particularly honored to have come through the ranks to
have the opportunity to lead an institution that is critical to meeting the
economic and environmental objectives of Northwest citizens.  "I'm committed
to operating BPA as a sound business enterprise, but one whose mission
starts with meeting our responsibilities to serve the public.  That means
striving for strong environmental stewardship, low rates, reliable service
and being open to the public's ideas about how best to use the assets that
provide so much value to the Northwest," Wright said.

Wright began his work at BPA in 1981 shortly after receiving his masters in
public affairs from the University of Oregon.  Following a stint in the
agency's energy conservation office, he moved to BPA's D.C. office in 1984.
In 1987, he began managing the agency's California office, then went back to
the D.C. office as manager in 1990.  In 1998, he returned to BPA
headquarters in Portland as Corporate senior vice president where he had
responsibility for public affairs; environment, fish and wildlife; finance
and budget; strategic planning; and human resources.  He became deputy
administrator in 2000, followed shortly by his appointment as acting
administrator.

He and his wife, Kathleen, and their three children live in Portland.  In
addition to his  masters, he holds an undergraduate bachelor of arts degree
in journalism from Central Michigan University.  He is 44 years old.
