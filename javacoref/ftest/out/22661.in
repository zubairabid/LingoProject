Ken and Jeff,
As I think you both know I have been active in recruiting at Cornell for the
Enron Associate program for several years now.  I also recently have become
involved with something called the Park Leadership Fellowship Board which
provides scholarships and forums to discuss business leadership issues.  They
are holding a pretty prominent event called Leadership week which will
include the business heads of Corning and American Express discussing their
company's strategies for defining leadership in business today.  I hate to
ask you guys to do things like this but it is a pretty big event and would
really highlight Enron's recognition of Cornell as being a "Core School" in
the MBA recruiting process.  The event as outlined below is scheduled for
March 28th.  I appreciate your consideration.
