Although yesterday's meeting was excellent, we do need to get a lot more detailed on the Re-start plans.  I would like everyone to have completed their re-start plans by the end of next week for mid/back office.  I realize you have all done a tremendous amount of work so far and this is what we really need to get in documentation form particularly as we may have a partner/buyer who we have not had as many detailed meetings with.

As you can see from the email below we are asking the commercial groups to do the same thing.

Let me know if there are any issues - we are planning for a Jan 20 restart.

Thanks

Louise
