The Research Group is conducting an access audit for its directory and subfolders.  I would appreciate receiving a list of access groups and their members for the O:\Research directory and subfolders.  If there were a way to list what kind of access each group has for each folder (or at least which groups have Modify access), it would be great.  I have already spoken with Sandra Hart who has begun the process.

Thank you for your assistance in our effort to maintain the integrity and security of our data.

Regards,
Martin Lin
