We need the Master Gas Agreement between Yazoo and ENA executed ASAP !!
In the last meeting, it was stated that for Clarksdale we would have the
third party supplier invoice
the Cities directly, however once the Yazoo rehab work was completed, ENA
would be supplying and
invoicing Yazoo.  Yazoo is near completion on the work, and has already
burned gas in their testing over
the past weekend. I currently have an imbalance with the pipe which  I need
to repay ASAP.  Also once the
Yazoo unit is completed, I have NO MECHANISM to deliver the gas until we
execute the Master Gas as
was discussed two weeks ago.
