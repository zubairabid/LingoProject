The inequities that I am referring to are:
SDG&E is charging a CTC charge to recover $115 million in CTCs for 2001 and
$115 million for 2002; wheras, their expectation is that there will be no
stranded costs in those years for SONGS and QF/PPs.  SDG&E plans to use these
overcollections to offset the undercollections from their cap for the subset
of small customers.
SDG&E has filed at FERC to apply RMR overcollections recovered from all
customers to the undercollections from their cap for the subset of small
customers.
SDG&E is applying the stranded benefits from SONGS and QF/PPs for which all
customers have paid for the stranded costs in the past to the
undercollections from their cap for the subset of small customers.
This is not necessarily a DA versus SO customers, since small DA and SO
customers are treated the same.  It is more of a subsidy issue between large
and small customers.  However, since most DA customers are large customers,
it becomes a DA and SO issue.
I don't believe SDG&E is hiding this fact, because they filed an application
at the CPUC on October 24, 2000, illuminating this issue.
We also need to keep our eyes open to spot any other transfer of
overcollections that should rightfully be used to reduce rates for all
customers.  What is motivating SDG&E is their perceived shareholder risks
with respect to the undercollections caused by the cap.  They want to reduce
their exposure.
We need to be sensitive to our TURN friends, but we want to illuminate the
shortcomings of this type of transition mechanism to prevent legislators and
regulators from switching to this mechanism in the shortrun.
