Westcoast, Coastal Split Engage Energy Assets

To prepare for El Paso Energy's looming takeover of Coastal Corp., Westcoast
Energy Inc. and Coastal are splitting up Engage Energy, their three-year-old
marketing venture, with each retaining a half interest in the Houston-based
gas marketer. The split should be completed by the end of the week.

Coastal, headquartered in Houston, will merge with El Paso Energy in a $16
billion deal by the end of the fourth quarter (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19), and
company officials said that several transactions needed to be completed
before the merger could be finalized, including dismantling the Engage
venture. Vancouver-based Westcoast and Coastal each own 50% interest in
Engage, which has 12 regional offices throughout North America and employs
300. One of the top North American gas marketers, it purchases natural gas
from every producing basin in North America, and trades electricity within
all NERC regions. Engage estimates it will add another 1 Bcf/d to its natural
gas deliverability by the end of this year.

NGI ranked Engage in 12th place in its 1999 North American power marketers
list, dropping from eighth place in 1998, losing about 15.2% in sales. Engage
reported a sales volume of 5.6 Bcf/d last year, compared with 6.6 Bcf/d the
previous year. It sold an estimated 2,100 Bcf of natural gas in 1999.

Westcoast and Coastal formed Engage in 1997 to offer a full spectrum of
energy services, including natural gas marketing and trading, electricity
trading and sales, energy management services, structured storage and
transportation-related services, structured power and management services and
energy risk management services. The companies said that those services would
continue as before. There is expected to be little impact on either company's
existing asset valuation.

Under the restructuring plan, Westcoast will retain the Engage Canadian
business entity and certain natural gas and power activities in the United
States. Westcoast also will retain the right to use the Engage Energy name
and will continue to conduct business from Calgary, Southfield, MI and other
U.S. locations. Coastal will retain the U.S. business entity, with
headquarters in Houston.

"By taking full ownership of our natural gas and electricity marketing and
trading functions, we can better capitalize on the knowledge, experience,
track record and infrastructure that we have built over the past three
years," said Michael Phelps, Westcoast CEO.

When Coastal merges with El Paso, it will be joining a company that already
has a strong gas marketing arm. NGI ranked El Paso seventh on its list of gas
marketers in 1999, noting that it traded 6.7 Bcf/d of natural gas last year.
It also was ranked seventh in 1998.
