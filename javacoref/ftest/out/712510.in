Andy, Christi Sarah and Lloyd

Please provide me your critical comments by Noon Monday, June 18.  The
Conference is June 19.

Andy Rodriquez is preparing a handout of a technical outline based on our
work with OATI on Electronic Scheduling.
MIT has requested to speak and I have been approached by one of their
students about a similar software approach.

Others cc: on this email are welcome to respond.
