Michelle -- As discussed, attached is a redlined and an execution copy of the
New Power QSE Agreement, for your review and transmission onwards to New
Power's Anoush Farhangi.  The document is being cc'd to the EPMI recipients
you had designated.  For their benefit I direct their attention to the
confidentiality obligations stated in Section 7.2:  in particular, EPMI will
be under obligations to keep New Power's scheduling and settlements
information confidential from EES and EES personnel.
Michelle, please note to New Power that: (1) New Power still needs to fill in
their contact/payments information on Schedule A. (2) the Enron Guarantee
format was not referenced in the document as Schedule E and Schedule E was
therefore eliminated.  Per the Credit Support Annex, each guarantee must be
in a format acceptable to the other party.  (3) The lengthy ERCOT Calendar
will be kept current on the MIS website, so it was not included as
'Attachment X' to the document.
Please call me with any questions or comments. --David
