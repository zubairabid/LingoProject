Dear Friends and Colleagues,

I have switched again my employment status between self-employment and
employment by joining the TXU Energy Trading on the capacity of their
Managing Director of Risk Management Operations.  Will commute home on
weekends, but otherwise, will be stationed in Dallas.  The new email
address is MJermak1@txu.edu, and the phone number is (214) 875-9603.

Regards,
Martin Jermakyan
