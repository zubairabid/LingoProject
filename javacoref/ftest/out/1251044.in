Apologies for the mass e-mail.

I know many of you are thinking that you received an e-mail message from me
to this effect not too long ago.  But, a good opportunity presented itself
and I've just started w/ Duke Energy in their Risk Management group.
Needless to say I hit the ground running and am starting my second week.
It's an exciting project - where we're working to develop a corporate wide
risk management system.

My new e-mail is relizondo1@duke-energy.com and you can also reach me at
713-627-4286.
