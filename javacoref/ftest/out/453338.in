This bill was supposed to be introduced today as the Senate Republican
Energy Message bill. (We don't have a bill number or verification that it was
actually introduced.)  However, we believe it will be held an introduced on
February 5-6th. This bill includes PUHCA repeal, PURPA repeal, Reliability
and Transmission eminent domain authority.

House Chairmen Tauzin and Barton announced their plans to travel to
California on a "fact finding" trip while they and other leaders meet today
at the White House along with Secretary Abraham to discuss policy responses
to the California situation.

The Senate Democrats do not plan to introduce their bill at all now while the
House members will wait to draft until after today's meetings.

The Feinstein legislation has bipartisan House cosponsors including
Congresswoman Bono and Congressman Hunter.

We will follow up with a more comprehensive memo as more details become known.
