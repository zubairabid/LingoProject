Bob, James, Roger,

Im having a hard time getting a response from the teams in the Midland Region
in completing the attached EOTT tank spreadsheet.  Ive heard from some of the
teams but nothing from others.  Im under the gun as to finding  out where the
MIdland Region is in term of permits and and environmental compliance and the
only way I can begin to make the evaluation is to have the field data inputed
onto the spreadsheet.  This is where the teams assistance is required.  I
have attached the latest version of the spreadsheet in the hope that you will
deliver it to the following teams for their valued input:

Monahans Team
Hamlin/Haskel Team
Lamesa Team
Big Lake Team
Midland Team
Eunice Team





Your assistance in this will be greatly appreciated.
