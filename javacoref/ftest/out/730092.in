I attended a very early GISB meeting where they were discussing this, and
at that point in time, the scope of their efforts appeared to be limited to
electronic commerce issues.  I think Jennifer Hein continued to attend the
meetings, or at least she was for a while.  I guess  I would like to get
some idea of where it's headed before I go.  What do the rest of you think?

Please see attached.  While I am not opposed to the formation of the
ESIB, I have several concerns based on preliminary indications that the
EISB will publish a "standardized" contract for wholesale power
transactions.  I'd like to avoid a third or even fourth (if you consider
ERCOT still to be a viable option) U.S. based wholesale power agreement.
As it appears that the formation of EISB is going forward, and has FERC
endorsement, it might be worthwhile to attend this workshop.  Please let me
know your thoughts.
