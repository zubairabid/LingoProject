Rod,
I hear you.  However, what's changed since the last time you and I spoke about this project is that our friend Bill Wise has been talking with the Chairman of Pemex about doing a similar (180 mile) expansion of El Paso's system from Waha to Samalayuca.  His proposal was to provide incremental firm service to Pemex at EPNG's currently effective "Texas" rates (low 20 cent range).  Pemex management is willing to recommend to its Board of Directors going with a slightly higher rate on TransPecos in order to get the benefits of supply diversity and leverage, but the TransPecos rate needs to be as close to EPNG's as possible to make the case compelling.
Therefore, what we're trying to accomplish here is to give Pemex a rate representing effectively a rate cap, with an "upside" that if the FERC rate is less than the cap (which it might well be), then Pemex gets the lower rate.  It's just going to be damned difficult to hit a McGwire home run here with El Paso breathing down our neck.  I truly believe this is the best we can negotiate for fear of Pemex going back to their comfort zone with EPNG.
Dan McCarty was with me in our last meeting in Mexico City and I think he was reading the tea leaves similarly.
