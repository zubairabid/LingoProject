Attached is a proposed test plan from HoustonStreet for tomorrow.  I have reserved conference room 2712 beginning at 2:30 tomorrow and will escort HoustonStreet onto our floor at 2:30 tomorrow.  They will be allowed to set up machines from 2:30 to 3:00.  At 3:00 we will allow HoustonStreet to discuss their plan prior to our review.

Enron has terminated the price posting agreement and has no obligation to do testing.  We have simply agreed to review their system.

During the review  anyone working with HoustonStreet should refrain from making any comments (positive or negative) concerning the performance of the system.  We will simply take the review under advisement.

All discussions with HoustonStreet should be handled by myself or Savita.

If you have any questions call me on 30397.
