Hi UT Team -
We're in a critical time in the recruiting process as offers have been
extended and we need to make sure they're accepted!  In order to ensure
cultivation of the UT candidates who received offers, we have assigned each
of you to a team of candidates to call at least once before the Holidays.
The teams are designed so there is an executive lead, an experienced Enron
representative, and/or an associate.  All members of the cultivation team
should contact each candidate assigned to their team each week.  If the
executive leads want to develop a more detailed strategy for their
cultivation team that is fine.  Each week the associate should report to me
about the candidates on their team, letting me know about any issues or
concerns.
The deadline for offer acceptance has been extended to January 2nd!  Please
communicate this to all candidates and make sure to let them know if the
paperwork is not in our office by January 2nd we will assume they are
declining.
If you have any questions or do not feel that you have the time to devote to
this, please let me know so we can replace you.  I really appreciate your
help!  Don't forget to call everyone at least once before the Holidays,
because they will be leaving campus for Christmas break soon!
