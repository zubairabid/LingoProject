Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on
dallasnews.com's Colleges site



CHIP SHOTS


Ricky Williams will be on hand Saturday to remind Longhorns fans what it was
like when UT could run the ball. Williams' No. 34 jersey will be retired just
prior to the Longhorns' entrance and the coin toss for Saturday's 11 a.m. Big
12 opening kickoff against Oklahoma State. Only one other UT jersey has been
retired and it belongs to the school's only other Heisman Trophy winner -
Earl Campbell's No. 20.

UT officials wanted to do this last year, but Texas didn't have a home game
when Williams' New Orleans Saints were off. This week, the Saints have a bye.

Just a refresher, Williams left Texas with 21 NCAA records and 46 UT
records. Among his 15 NCAA career records that still stand are his 7,206
all-purpose yards, 11,200-yard rushing games and 6.2 yards per carry. His
6,279 rushing yards, 72 rushing touchdowns and 75 total touchdowns rank
second on the NCAA all-time career lists.

Williams claimed the NCAA rushing titles in 1997 and 1998 and was the NCAA
scoring leader in 1997.

This came in from one of the readers this week:

Just wanted to let you know that a multimedia (CD-ROM) tribute to Ricky
Williams has been available for almost a year. It contains video showing
Ricky breaking about 10 records, a panoramic tour of the UT football
facilities, Ricky Williams personal scrapbooks, his rings and trophies in 3D,
and a few other notable features. Unfortunately the company that produced the
CD-ROM (called Run Ricky!) has gone out of business due to the fact the NCAA
would not allow the company to release the title during the summer. But the
CD-ROM is still available at the Texas co-op and Longhorns Ltd. at
DKR-Memorial.




Longhorn Q & A
Q: What is the start time for the Texas-Oklahoma game?
Sanford Gaines

BROWN:  The Texas OU-game is 11 a.m. Oct. 7 at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.

Ivan Williams

Q: Last year, the coaches raved about Ivan Williams and almost took off his
redshirt. Now, a year later, he hasn't gotten a sniff at real playing time at
tailback. What happened to tailback by committee? It seems like we could use
a bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).
Bob Nance



BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the
Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more
carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness
needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought he
was running tentatively.

Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut loose
this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three
games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week
is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to do
it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yards
per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,
yielding 47.0 ypg). I think it will be tough sledding for the UT RBs this
week. Should be a good passing game, though.



Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calling on
offense, and feel that Texas can never win a national championship with Greg
Davis as offensive coordinator. Any comments?
Reggie Reeves

BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the
nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT is
fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game
stinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback
rotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms from
peaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.

Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The
Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.
Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles
to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,
the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love
him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.

Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staff in
the near future for a head job or head coordinator job in the NFL, it's Greg
Davis.



Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited about
this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the
football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied
that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but
they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the season
with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it is
still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caught
up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.

Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT going
8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. They
are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against
really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient
this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my
days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em!
Larry, Dallas

BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's shown
this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third
possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two
guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to go
untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.

This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has been
sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected
cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman
Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play better
in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while
for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,
however, may be too late against a good team.

The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line to
have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that
appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory
Quye), two juniors (Antwan Kirk-Hughes, Matt Anderson) and a sophomore
(Derrick Dockery).



Q: How frustrated is Chris Simms with his lack of playing time? In the
off-season I kept hearing about how most of the players were really impressed
with the passing abilities of Simms. Are any of the players now questioning
why Chris is not playing more than he is?
Jeff Weaver, Dallas

BROWN:  Simms said this week that the rotation is difficult. But players
have not chosen sides. Simms says there are times when he makes a mistake and
would love to go back in and correct it, even though his rotation is up and
Major Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.

Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series before
Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep
pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,
he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.
Johnson, the safer choice. "It was the smarter thing to do," he said.

My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing time as
possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come
Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the
coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the
hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, will
Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coaches
have tended to lean on Applewhite whenever it's crunch time.

Major Applewhite

Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is
having to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alums
and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think what
is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.
A "Major" Longhorn fan from Dallas

BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is
constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing
time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring
everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.

According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be
allowed to

compete  for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whether
Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he
deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.

It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's a
breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent
completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB
rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 257
yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But
Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what
Simms can do.



Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?
Sara McFadden

BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability this
season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he
could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until he
lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this
offense. But it's almost impossible to know.

The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid. It
is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and
break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being "the
man" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked
onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play
QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.

I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive
coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for
more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decided
to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense through
three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has more
passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to 7
in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in
2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 to
1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.

I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were allowed
to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if he
got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their
production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this
rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about
this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks all
season long.



Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing
defenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the
offense too complex so that they don't know their assignments  or are they
simply being outplayed?
Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas

BROWN:  The offensive linemen, quarterbacks and coaches all say that they
have seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games. Coach Mack
Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive
schemes that they had shown in previous games.

Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating UT,
so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against
Stanford, UT wasn't good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to UT
personnel, the defenses have been new. Now that it's the fourth game of the
season, one would think there are only so many defenses the O-line hasn't
seen. The excuses are running out.

Ricky Brown

Q: It appears to me that Texas really misses the blocking of Ricky Brown,
both in the running game and in the blitz pick-up. Who is Texas recruiting to
replace him? I don't question Matt Trissel's effort, but he just doesn't seem
to be getting it done for Texas.
Bart Jacobs

BROWN:  The coaches are recruiting a fullback named James Buchanan of
Sarasota, Fla., Cardinal Mooney, who is also being pursued by Florida State
and Florida. But they are happy with Matt Trissel. They say he's young and
needs a little more time to get adjusted to the fullback position after
excelling at linebacker in high school. Mack Brown considers Trissel a leader
on the offense despite his status as a redshirt freshman. He's had some
botched blocking assignments, but so have all the other backs.



Q: Despite a visit from the nutritionist during the off-season, and a much
publicized weight loss, the offensive line still appears overweight and slow.
What is Jeff Madden doing the rectify this problem? If this problem
persists,

might Texas be looking to hire a new strength coach? I know Madden is a good
friend of Mack Brown's, but production has to be the bottom line, and right
now, it appears Madden isn't getting it done. I enjoy your newsletter. Thank
you for your time.
James Taglienti

BROWN:  Madden is someone I consider UT's secret weapon. He's much more than
a coach for this team. He works their bodies and minds and can be credited
with getting this team to believe that it could beat Nebraska back in 1998.
The players love and respect him even though he works them to the ground.
None of the breakdowns so far this season can be attributed to Madden.
Physically, the players are in good shape. Their problems are mental. Madden
is one of the most valued members of the staff.

Q: Are there any hopes for a national championship considering the loss to
Stanford?
Liddy Newsome

BROWN:  Anything is possible. Texas would need Nebraska to remain
undefeated, and then hope the other top 10 teams pick up a loss or two. If
Texas could go unbeaten the rest of the way and beat an undefeated and No. 1
Nebraska in the Big 12 title game, the Longhorns could possibly get lucky and
end up in the Orange Bowl. But that is about as long a shot as Ricky Williams
suiting up for UT this Saturday.



Q: I have heard a lot about how much talent Chance Mock has. How does his
talent compare to that of Chris Simms? If he wouldn't have redshirted, could
he have beat out Chris or possibly Major Applewhite as the main guy?
Brett Holmes

BROWN:  Not a chance. No pun intended. Mock asked to redshirt because he has
much to learn and wants to step in after Simms and Applewhite move on.



Q: I think Hodges Mitchell is a good kid, with a good pedigree ... and
there's the rub. Is Coach Brown too in love with this kid? Is he doing an old
friend a favor by keeping this kid in the game? He had a decent season last
year, especially coming out of the shadow of Ricky Williams, but I have seen
nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.

I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical "scat-back,"
Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a
quick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.
Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the
"vision" required of a good running back? I cannot believe that he is that
much better than the other running backs on the roster. Are the rest that
bad? There has to be more to the story.
Roy Cassas

BROWN:  Mitchell apparently needs to be pushed to the brink of losing his
job to really find traction. Last year, he was on the verge of losing his job
to Victor Ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to 1,300 yards
rushing and 300 yards receiving. He says he is ready to cut loose, again (in
the fourth game, just like last year).  The problem is, Texas is playing
Oklahoma State this week, who has the nation's No. 1 defense against the run.
Last year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149
yards. We'll see if he can shake the slump he's in. Otherwise, look for Ike
and Kenny Hayter to start getting more of the load.



Q: In your most recent "Inside UT Football" you mentioned that stations on
the UT football network are listed on the texassports.com Web site. I have
another suggestion for people such as me who live in other parts of the
country, or overseas. I have found that all (I think) NCAA top 25 broadcasts
are carried on http://sports.yahoo.com/. They carry all NFL radio broadcasts
as well. One of the beauties about this site is that if you don't like one
set of announcers you can usually switch over to those who carry the opposing
team. As my grandson would say, "And that's really cool." I enjoy your weekly
newsletter very much. Keep it up.
Bud Sloan, Reno, Nev.

BROWN:  Thanks for sharing, Bud. Hope this helps some other folks.



Q: Why does Coach Mack Brown reject criticism with cynicism, yet accept
praise with zeal? To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while
citing fans as "... being negative and openly critical ..." (i.e., four
losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB
controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,
Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites
the team's emotional psyche as "... being fragile," yet Coach Brown fueled
this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.

Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's
mental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown's tenure paralleling the turbulent
and volatile path taken by rival coach Jackie Sherrill at Texas A(no egos in
that one!) during the 1980s?
David Newburn

BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to help
his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very
sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds
them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone questions
the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negative
and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I
honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light
that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He
forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That
people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or
worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see
Stanford).

I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public
appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the tradition
to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his
team. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the
first to pick up the team when it's down. Not pile on.

But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, gets 10
penalties and gives up another blocked punt for a TD. There is no question he
is still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at Texas.
When his team loses a game it shouldn't and plays terribly in doing so, he
will always hear it from the fans and the press, whether his team is young or
not.



Q: Why do you suppose the Longhorns are throwing so few really long passes
this year? It seems to me doing so would open up the running game like it was
when Ricky Williams was playing.
Will Vernon

BROWN:  They need some more time. The young receivers need a little more
time to adjust. But I do think that with the athleticism of the young
receivers, you will see more short routes that turn into long gains. Once Roy
Williams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson develop some comfort in this offense,
I think you'll see more long pass plays.



Q: I just have two questions that have been frustrating for me this year.
The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting to
have an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes, but
why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why does
Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?

He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in the
kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but
his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a
gamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant
minutes, why not trust them with the return game?

Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?
Hampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your
All-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn't
they push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?
Jeff Wilson

BROWN:  Brown trusts Mitchell not to get tight and muff a punt return in
front of 80,000 people. That's not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I
would like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he
can do. Vasher has been fearless in everything I've seen him do. Mitchell
hasn't shown breakaway moves yet. If we don't see it soon, it might be time
to give someone else a shot.

They take Hampton out on nickel situations because they think that Shaun
Rogers is the better pass rusher from the tackle position. There has been no
talk about moving Rogers to end in pass-rush situations.



Q: Coach Mack Brown appeared to be auditioning for the head coach job at the
University of Oklahoma in the last minutes of the Houston game. Apparently
unsatisfied with a 40-0 lead and two minutes to go, the Horns unloaded a long
pass from the arm of Chris Simms who hadn't been able to do anything all
night. Just when everyone was ready to run the clock out,  Brown, or Simms
(whoever was in charge), elected to do whatever necessary to humiliate our
guests even more by rubbing their noses in it. I, for one, was not very proud
of being a Texas-ex for the last two minutes of that game. Texas football
traditions took a hard blow in that  Switzer-like move. Shame.
Jim Ball, Class of '57, Big Sandy, Texas

BROWN:  Mack Brown says he had Simms throwing late in the game to get
experience and live snaps because there could come a time in the future where
Texas needs to move the ball late in a game to win, as it needed to do
against Stanford.

The pass into the end zone to Sloan Thomas in the waning seconds was a
checkoff that Chris Simms made. Mack Brown said he wished that Simms hadn't
done that. But Simms actually made the right read. Simms said he bobbled the
snap or it would have been a touchdown.

There was a huge outpouring of criticism for having Simms pass the ball when
UT needs experience running the ball. What better time to work on running the
ball than at the end of the game? There is an argument to be made there. Mack
Brown said his team got criticized for not being able to hold onto the ball
and run out the clock after taking a lead at the end of the Stanford game.
Now, he says he's being criticized for moving the ball at the end of the
Houston game.

"We get hammered either way," Brown said. He added that he wasn't trying to
run it up on Houston for the chop block that led to Shaun Rogers' injury, and
he wasn't trying to pay back the Cougars for what John Jenkins used to do in
running it up. He said the team was just working to get better.



Q: What happened to Sneezy Beltran, the much-heralded running back out of
Abilene High?
Eddie Alvarado

BROWN:  Beltran has asked to redshirt this season.
