Dirk/Jay - thanks for the quick response.  I want to insure we have
accurately portrayed the situation to you both (the real duration of our
requests, and the real response time of the utilities).  Don't want anyone to
walk into a response of "..... we've only had that request for XX days....".
We do need help though if we want to achieve our aggressive schedule.
We are falling behind our target schedule due to a lack of pulse meter
contact installations.  How hard would it be to get informal org charts for
the metering side of SCE, SDGE, and PGE (just simple bob works for jim who
works for tom who reports to bill), and......, to identify who (within
Enron/CEC/ISO) has the relationship(s) with those groups?
The execution side of the boxter effort asked Jay who they could talk to to
insure we were working "smart" in California with respect to getting interval
meters modified to include pulse contacts.  The execution team wants to
insure that we aren't standing in the wrong long line.  We want to know who
we could/should call to express our "appreciation" for all their cooperation,
and to insure they knew our aggressive timetable.   How many times have
you/we heard "........ oh....., that's what you are doing....., if someone
had just called me........, I could have........".
The request for "contacts" (and to know the metering org chart inside each of
these three utilities) was so we could attempt to penetrate those three org's
(SCE, SDGE, PG&E) at the optimum level.  Additionally - if we have acct mgmt
folks that have relationships - we want to leverage those.
Tom - can you provide to those listed above the short exec summary of what we
have requested from SDGE, SCE, PGE, and...., what their response has been
(use the attached XLS chart).  Help charactarize when we officially made
request, so that we provide an accurate perception of the three utility's
responses.
Thx
