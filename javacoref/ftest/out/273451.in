Tom/Sally,
The Financial Settlements team performed one last test on the InvoiceLogic module today.  They feel very comfortable with the functionality of the module.  All of their major issues have been resolved.  I have confirmed this with Mechelle Stevens as well.  Therefore, I am comfortable giving my approval that InvoiceLogic is ready for release for Beta Testing.
