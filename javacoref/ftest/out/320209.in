It's been a while since the last e-mail, so thought I'd bring you up to
date.
Michael was back in the hospital for a week, starting Good Friday, with an
infection/flu.  He's pretty much recovered from that, but the net result was
that the bone marrow transplant has been delayed  because of his condition.
His white cells (the infection fighters) are down, so he needs a boost in
their count.  Once they're up to an acceptable level, and everything else is
OK, the transplant process will start.
The marrow was taken from the donor last Thursday, the 3rd.  The report is
that it's healthy marrow.  It's now in a freezer, waiting for Michael to be
able to receive it.
