Jeff:  I have followed up with other DOE politicals who advised they will
meet this Thursday with Bob Gee to finalize and approve his speech to NARUC
on Monday, July 24th.  It is looking positive that he may be positioned to
make the announcement Monday.  However, DOE will likely need to revisit some
folks on the current Blue Ribbon Reliability Panel in order to replace some
of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on
business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet  like
APX, Altra, and HoustonStreet.Com. (these are Steve Kean's suggestions.)
Too, I have been cautioned about referring to the Blue Ribbon Reliability
Panel as a model since their timeline was slow, but rather suggest the TVA
Blue Ribbon Panel model since they were able to issue a report after only
four meetings.  I have asked for this issue to be brought to Secretary
Richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week.  I have also
discussed this with John Anderson of ELCON who is supportive.
