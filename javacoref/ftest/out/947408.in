Hi again,

As, I stated is a prior emails, the contact details for the RiskCalc folks
are as follows:

1.  Marc Brammer
Director of Strategic Sales
tel:  800.523.2627, x5706
mbrammer@MoodysRMS.com

2. Neal Clark
Vice President
Tel:  800.523.2627, x5701
nclark@MoodysRMS.com

Neal said that he would be willing to set up a meeting between us and their
quants to better understand their model, the various inputs and whether or
not the model can be tweaked for less than the 17 specified inputs.

Let me know if you guys wish to have Neal set up a conference between
Moody's quants and Enron folks in Houston and London.


Ciao,
Iris
