SUMMARY OF FERC,S
ORDER ESTABLISHING PROSPECTIVE MITIGATION AND MONITORING PLAN FOR THE
CALIFORNIA WHOLESALE ELECTRIC MARKETS AND ESTABLISHING AN INVESTIGATION OF
PUBLIC UTILITY RATES IN WHOLESALE WESTERN ENERGY MARKETS
(Issued April 26, 2001)
Effective Date -- Price mitigation is effective May 29, 2001.  (ISO needs to
have its day-ahead proxy price ready on 5/28)
Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will
require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time to
the extent not scheduled in bilateral trade.  All California generators, even
those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the
ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate
transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (This
requirement to provide power is for all hours (24/7) for 1yr)
Price Mitigation - The plan will establish a single market clearing price
auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the
ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a
participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power
and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission
rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2/MWh for O&M.  The gas cost will
be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California;
emissions are to be based on Cantor Fitzgerald Environmental Brokerage
Services.  The ISO will publish by 8:00 am, the gas and emission figures to
be used for the next day in any hour where an emergency is declared. These
figures (for the next day) will be based on the prior day's Gas Daily and
Cantor Fitzgerald data. A single market clearing price is determined in real
time for all generators.  Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each
gas-fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO within 5 days, on a
confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit.  The
ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator,
including maintenance and operating costs.  Generators that submit bids at or
below the market clearing price will not be subject to refund liability.
(Although the following qualification is made: &However, all public utility
rates will be subject to refund for violations of the conditions imposed on
market-based rates, discussed infra.8  Presumably this has to do with
anomalous bidding behavior.)  In the event a generator submits a bid higher
than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 days of the end of each
month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC
explicitly acknowledges that some units may have gas costs that exceed the
&all delivery point8 index it has adopted. FERC has 60 days to review/act.
No opportunity costs in real time.  Marketers are not held to any generator
cost standard but must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on
specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost.
Underscheduling Penalites -- FERC acknowledges that the there is a pending
request to revoke the current underscheduling penalty but indicates that it
is still in place.  Thus, although it may be advantageous to wait to buy
power in R/T at capped prices, doing so may make the scheduling coordinator
subject to the currently effective $100/MWh penalty.  See p. 20 of the FERC
order.
New Generation --  New generation is NOT exempted from the Commission,s price
mitigation measures.
Demand Response -- Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving
entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load
to be curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to make the demand
curve more price responsive.  (This requirement is in effect for all hours
(24/7))
Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced
outages The ISO is required to make a tariff filing within 15 days of the
order proposing a mechanism for coordination and control of outages,
including periodic reports to the Commission.
Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.
RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1
or Order lapses with no further effect.  The RTO filing is to be consistent
with the characteristics and functions in Order No. 2000.
ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how
things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due
in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.
Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate
authority of all public utilities is conditioned on (1) no physical withhold
of capacity, and (2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate
bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the
generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit
behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be
inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited
(i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).  Other
prohibited bidding practices identified include: pricing a single unit much
higher than other units in a supplier portfolio and changes in bids due to
increased scarcity rather than changes in generator costs.
West-Wide Section 206 Investigation  ) Opens a section 206 investigation
concerning the J&R of wholesale power in the WSCC other than sales to the
CAISO market.    FERC requests comments on the scope and nature of price
mitigation.  However its proposal is that refund conditions apply only in
real time (markets for power less than 24 hours in advance of R/T) spot
markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7% within a
control area.    FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in
California.  Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  Although
it is still formulating its price mitigation plan for the non-California PNW,
the FERC sets the refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the
Order.
NOx Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is
prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines
does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part
of the price bid.  Also if NOx is limited, may seek to show that generation
would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.
Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on (1)
whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an
escrow account to pay past costs and (2) the effect this surcharge would have
on the PG&E bankruptcy filing.
Treatment of the CAISO,s Market Stabilization Plan (MSP). The FERC rejects
the CAISO,s MSP saying that FERC,s plan for market mitigation is sufficient.
It expressly rejects CAISO,s plan to create a day-ahead and hour-ahead energy
markets are expressly reject and tells CAISO to stop actions to implement
software changes to effectuate such markets.  Unfortunately, it does not
expressly reject CAISO,s plan to cut exports.  In general, no mention was
made as to issue of exports of power from California although the statement
that CAISO must become a real RTO would support the notion that CAISO must
honor firm schedules on its system..
