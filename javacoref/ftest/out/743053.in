I've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing.  Few questions.
Mike,
I understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of Questar.  Do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill?
What about the generators?  Have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)?
What about large customers?  They been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed SoCalGas (and the PUC) for not delivering it.
Do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill?  I'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem.
There doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state.
If that's true, wouldn't the PUC take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state?
Any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful.  Don't want Enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do.
Thanks again for the heads up.
Best,
Jeff
