Gentlemen,

With the company moving forward as Enron Transportation Services and the
Southwest Operations Area in place. The Southwest Environmental Team wants to
let you know they are ready to provide the same quality service and support
that they have in the past.  This should be a smooth transition but there are
still many details to workout with the addition of EOTT facilities and
boundary changes.  The team along with the rest of Environmental Health and
Safety will be meeting in the next few weeks to discuss the details of
assuring support to all customers.

Please contact any of the team members below for their normal efficient
service.
