The following details the reserve amounts being recorded on TW at 3/31/01

We are reserving the Sempra and Sid Richardson transport invoices above max. rate due to the FERC order making these negotiated rate amounts subject to refund.  Total Reserve $9,173,137.

We are reserving the 1st quarter UAF gains totaling $1,103,326, we have a verbal report from Gas Control and Market Services that CIG has disputed TW's measurement at their interconnect and until the matter is settled the gains reported in the 1st quarter need to be reserved.

In March '01 business TW is invoicing SoCal a PPA for an additional $2.2 million for billings that go back over 12 months.  Marketing feels that the contract should have been billed a higher rate than Max. Rates.  Marketing has requested that we  reserve the entire $2.2 million due to the uncertainty of collection.

If anyone does not concur with these entrys and would like to discuss these reserves please contact Dan Fancler or Debbie Moseley.

Thanks,  Dan
