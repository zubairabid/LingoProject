The rumors of my demise have been greatly exagerated!  Congrats to Maxfield
as we knew all along which conference was the stronger.  I will net out all
"outstanding" debts against Eric's schedule.  However, I refuse to pay out
any winnings until all accounts have been settled.  I will not get stuck
holding the empty bag; I understand now why Eric didn't want to have
anything to do with the money.  I trust everyone can read this e-mail and
deduce
how much you owe me.  I will give the "outstanding" franchises until Jan.
4th to contact me and arrange payment terms without being disgraced by
having
their names mentioned as being "outstanding" at this point of the season.  I
would prefer to not mention any names, GRASS, unless I have to!
