Hi Greg,

We are hosting a meeting from 9-11am on Friday 26th October for a number of people from your Military. They are coming to see us as a reference sight for TIBCO software, which they may want to use within their operations. Given the current state of the nation I thought this might be a good opportunity for Enron to help out. I also wanted to know if you or Mr Lay may want meet them. Let me know, they are on a very tight schedule and are visiting NASA directly after us.



These guys are Washington based employees.. Stratcom controls our nuclear

arsenal..
