As anticipated when the constraints of having  the "luck of the draw" taken out of the equation, I have moved into a first  place draw with Headley Jones in our newly formatted hockey pool. I never  once drew first pick in all previous Uncle Buzzy pools (remember him?) , so  this feels particularly sweet. With one game left, all I need is one point  from either Jason Arnott or Beretta Blake to stand alone. My only worry is a  Brodeur shut-out.
I offered Don Headley a split earlier when I was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. Charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which I explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. Discussions would have had to be held "in camera"  and 2. Others would have to be negatively impacted.  Neither of these criteria were met. I was simply being a good  capitalist.
Regardless, our American friends have yet to pony  in, nor has Galea ll, and I want my clams immediately! McConvey ( in  perhaps the orangiest, sweetest moment of all), please send the $20 owing  to my employer's address below, I do not want you having  access to my home address.
On as totally separate note, I'm beginning to now  look past when my son Yanic arrives and hold true in my very public decree that  having a child will not totally change my life. As such, we should open up  discussions on a second annual road trip, perhaps in late September? I know  Glove is very interested this year, and I'm sure Lav could be pried away from  cooking his companies books for a long week-end. We could always do Tremblant  again, but I'm in Mack's corner (for the first time ever!) in stating that I  could care less if we golf!!! Perhaps we could do Vegas, visit Lav or Glove (  which their respective wives would love) or simply go to my cottage. It doesn't  really matter, as long as we're together for a few laughs!!!!!! Air Canada is  offering $235 flights to Norfolk and Charleston, but that would obviously mean  golf, which increasingly irritates me with all its gimmicky  bullshit!!
So the floor is open for discussion, and knowing us  , I hope you all have enough space in your hard drive for the written  diarrhea that you're about to be assaulted with over the next month, until we  can all agree on something! Are you ready Charles? (" If he's in, I'm OUT!)".  Hey McConvey, are you going live a little outside that Weston comfort zone of  yours and spend a few shillings elsewhere?
Let the witchypooing begin. I'll explain that to  you later Lav.
