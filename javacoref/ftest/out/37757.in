Each year we are subject to new Canada Pension Plan (CPP) and Employment Insurance (EI) rates.  Our new rates for 2002 are:

CPP is 4.70% with an annual maximum employee contribution of $1,673.20

EI is 2.20% with an annual maximum employee contribution of $858.00

Your net pay will reflect these two deductions at their new rate until you reach the annual maximum employee contribution.   Please give me a call if you have any questions.
