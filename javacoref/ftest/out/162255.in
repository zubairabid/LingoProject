PG&E is trying to rewrite history.  The following Advice Letter requests that
the CPUC value hydro at $2.8 billion versus $1 billion effective June 28,
2000.  The purpose of this maneuver is so that PG&E can claim the rate freeze
had ended at the end of June and that they can pass on the high cost of
energy beginning July to retail customers versus incurring the shareholder
risks.  What PG&E is doing is the equivalent of making a bet and trying to
change the point spread after the game is in the fourth quarter.  We need to
make sure that people understand how slimy this is and more importantly that
PG&E does not get its way.  PG&E was the one who delayed hydro valuation and
low-balled the value.  They are responsible for their predicament, not the
regulators or legislators.  Further, their roll-off matrices always showed
that the rate freeze could never end before 1/1/01.  It seems to me that they
have been frauding everybody.
