PG&E has changed the method of calculating the PX Credit recently.  Prior to
June they appeared to be using a market based price for power, but in June
the credit dropped to about $40/MWh which looks like utility-owned gen.

We want to make sure we are not missing a utility-levied charge in our
forward curves ( e.g. CTC charge that will be applied to DA) so we're trying
to verify the utilities' method of calculating PX credits.

I talked to the PG&E accounting person who said that their Regulatory group
has sent Enron's regulatory group information on the way the PX Credit is
calculated.  Can someone locate this information and forward it to me as soon
as possible?  Given that our customers are all switching to DA we don't want
to discover there's a charge we don't know about.

Thanks,
Tamara.

WSJ(1/14) UBS Emerges As Top Bidder For Enron Trading Unit
01/14/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright  2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
By Mitchell Pacelle and Rebecca Smith
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal
UBS AG, the giant Swiss financial firm, emerged the apparent victor to acquire Enron Corp.'s North American energy-trading operation. Enron hopes the deal will breathe new life into its dormant trading business, once the generator of 90% of the Houston company's profit.
But obstacles to resurrecting the business remain formidable, as indicated by the fact there were only two serious bidders -- UBS and Citigroup Inc. Enron wouldn't see any serious money from the UBS deal for at least a year, indicating how difficult it will be for the energy company's creditors to recover what they are owed. Enron filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-court protection on Dec. 2, the largest such filing ever, shielding the company from creditors as it seeks to reorganize.
Under the terms of the deal, which is subject to bankruptcy-court approval, Enron would transfer to UBS Warburg, the investment banking arm of UBS, its wholesale energy-trading operation, including a staff of roughly 800 people and computer systems and hardware that comprised its once-mighty EnronOnline Internet-based trading platform. UBS wouldn't be acquiring any of Enron's huge book of trading positions which gradually would be unwound. It also wouldn't provide any cash upfront to Enron.
Instead, UBS would pay royalties to Enron amounting to one-third of the energy-trading enterprise's pretax profit for a 10-year period, according to Enron. UBS would have an option to eliminate the royalty payments through the payment to Enron of money in years three, four and five. UBS would pay Enron 5.75 times Enron's prior-year payment for each one-third share of royalty eliminated. As such, it could completely eliminate Enron's royalty payments by the end of the fifth year.
As incentive to buy out Enron, UBS's royalty payments otherwise would increase by 10% from years five through 10, up to a maximum of 44% share of pretax profit.
Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey McMahon said yesterday that he felt it was a "grand-slam great deal" for creditors since new life is being breathed into a "perishable commodity." Enron's staff had been kept together largely on the basis of retention bonuses that expire at the end of February. The trading operation effectively suspended operations prior to Enron's Chapter 11 filing last month.
Enron had hoped to bring in a credit-worthy partner to take a 51% stake in a new trading joint venture, leaving the energy company with a 49% stake. But Mr. McMahon said no bidder was interested in that deal. There also were no bids for the trading operation from rival energy or energy-trading companies. One possible reason was that resuscitating Enron's vast trading business would require a top credit rating, lots of capital to back trading operations and an expert credit-risk department to keep track of what traders are doing and to constantly revalue the trading book.
Since the Enron debacle, other energy-trading firms have taken pains to show they are de-emphasizing commodity-like trading of electricity, which Enron pioneered, and are instead concentrating on selling their own output of energy products and entering into contracts to protect themselves against price volatility.
Mr. McMahon said he feels that "by virtue of a AA-plus bank purchasing this business, it changes the landscape of the energy-merchant business forever" by putting more clout in the hands of institutions with top credit ratings. UBS apparently hasn't committed to provide any set level of capital. There is no determination, yet, for how royalty payments would be divided among Enron's thousands of creditors.
The largest question, though, is whether the trading business can truly be revived. Although Enron's global wholesale division, which included as its biggest component the North American energy-trading operations, generated about $3 billion in pretax profit during the first nine months of 2001, it has been dormant now for more than a month. Martin Bienenstock, Enron's lead bankruptcy lawyer, characterized the deal as "the sale of something that was dead that we are trying to bring back to life."
Competitors say they think a certain amount of Enron's trades were conducted at very thin margins in order to build volume, and that such trading practice likely will disappear. "You'll see the churn going away," says Michael McNally, chief financial officer of TXU Corp., now the biggest electricity trader in Texas. He thinks EnronOnline has "significant value but there's only a limited number of people who would know how to use it." Scaled to transact trades on hundreds of types of contracts, the platform is oversized for most uses.
UBS Warburg, which bought PaineWebber in 2000, has looked to expand its U.S. market share, and the Enron deal would provide entry into energy trading. John Costas, chief executive of UBS Warburg, said Friday the Enron unit would be "a valuable extension of our world-wide trading activities."
The winner of the auction, held under the bankruptcy court's supervision, was announced shortly after noon Friday in a packed Manhattan courtroom, less than an hour after the two bidders had submitted final offers. Enron's advisers and its creditors committee, which endorsed the UBS deal, had negotiated nonstop for more than 24 hours. In addition to Citigroup, which Mr. McMahon said competed "neck and neck" with UBS, BP PLC, the British oil company, had submitted a $25 million bid for the computer settlement support system of the Enron unit.
The proposed UBS transaction is subject to approval by Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, who officially closed the auction to new bidders Friday. A hearing is set for Thursday at which creditors will have an opportunity to voice objections.
Separately Friday, Judge Gonzalez declined to transfer the bankruptcy case to Houston, denying motions from several creditors who had argued that Enron's headquarters city was a more suitable venue.

One of the most important credit tools available to help Enron Wholesale Services (EWS) manage counterparty credit risk is setoff rights.  This is particularly true as our trading business is expanding to include numerous commodity lines, including gas, power, coal, steel, pulp and paper, each of which may be traded under different masters with a single counterparty.  This complexity is further increased as a result of EWS using multiple affiliated entities to trade the various commodities.  Absent express contractual setoff rights, EWS may be unable to setoff exposures under different master contracts.

A team of EWS lawyers has been working to assemble setoff language that will substantially enhance EWS's credit position with counterparties with whom we trade multiple commodities.  This setoff language, which is set forth below, must be in all EWS trading form contracts.  Similarly, when negotiating on third party paper, we should request that this additional setoff language be added.


MANDATORY SETOFF LANGUAGE FOR
EWS TRADING CONTRACTS

(A) Upon the designation or deemed designation of an Early Termination Date, the Non-Defaulting Party ("X") may, at its option and in its discretion, setoff, against any amounts Owed to the Defaulting Party ("Y") by X or any Affiliate of X under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), any amounts Owed by Y to X or any of X's Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s).  The obligations of Y and X under this Agreement in respect of such amounts shall be deemed satisfied and discharged to the extent of any such setoff exercised by X and/or X's Affiliates.  X will give Y notice of any setoff effected under this section as soon as practicable after the setoff is effected provided that failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of the setoff.  For purposes of this Section __, "Owed" shall mean any amounts owed or otherwise accrued and payable (regardless of whether such amounts have been or could be invoiced) as of the Early Termination Date.

Amounts subject to the setoff permitted in this Section __ may be converted by X into any currency in which any obligation Owed is denominated at the rate of exchange at which X, acting in a reasonable manner and in good faith, would be able to purchase the relevant amount of the currency being converted. If an obligation is unascertained, X may in good faith estimate that obligation and setoff in respect of the estimate, subject to the relevant party accounting to the other when the obligation is ascertained.  Nothing in this Section __shall be effective to create a charge or other security interest except as may be provided under applicable law.   This setoff provision shall be without prejudice and in addition to any right of setoff, netting, off-set, combination of accounts, counterclaim, lien or other right to which any party is at any time otherwise entitled (whether by operation of law, contract or otherwise).  Each of the parties represent and acknowledge that the rights set forth in this Section __ are an integral part of the agreement between the parties and that without such rights the parties would not be willing to enter into Transactions.  The parties further acknowledge that each is executing this Agreement on behalf of itself as principal and, with respect to this Section ___, as agent on behalf of its Affiliates, which Affiliates shall receive the benefits of this Section __ and otherwise be bound as if such Affiliates had directly signed this Agreement as it relates to Section ___.

(B) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Non-Defaulting Party shall not be required to pay to the Defaulting Party any amount under Section __ until the Non-Defaulting Party receives confirmation satisfactory to it in its reasonable discretion (which may include an opinion of its counsel) that all other obligations of any kind whatsoever of the Defaulting Party to make any payments to the Non-Defaulting Party or any of its Affiliates under this Agreement or under any other agreement(s), instrument(s) or undertaking(s), which are Owed as of the Early Termination Date have been fully and finally satisfied.

This new setoff language will provide EWS the right to setoff amounts due and owing as of the Early Termination Date (but does not include future payments) between the counterparty and EWS and its affiliates (triangular setoff) after the designation of an Early Termination Date.  This language has been reviewed by U.S. bankruptcy counsel, and is appropriate under U.S. laws for commodity transactions with U.S.-based counterparties.  Each group will need to review this language with their local counsel in each jurisdiction in which EWS trades in order to ensure enforceability.   In addition, prior to introducing this language into your forms, changes will be required to terminology and/or to include terminations resulting from events other than Events of Default (e.g. "Affected Party" under ISDA).  Finally, when incorporating this setoff language into the EWS trading forms, please be aware that this language is not intended to override the payment netting terms (monthly netting of receivables) or the close-out netting procedures (applicable upon the designation of an Event of Default), both of which should remain in the trading forms.  Rather, this language is only intended to add setoff rights to all EWS trading forms.  When incorporating this setoff language into your trading forms, you will need to review the forms to determine if there are any references to setoff or other similar concepts that will need to be overridden and/or coordinated.  Finally, in order to assist all lawyers in negotiating these setoff provisions, we are in the process of preparing a brief explanation of how this setoff works and why it is mutually beneficial to EWS and our counterparties, which explanation you will be able to share with your counterparties. This explanation will be distributed shortly.

If you have any questions, please contact me at 713-853-6544 or Elizabeth Sager at 713-853-6349.

On May 22, 2001 HoustonStreet representatives (Frank Getman, John Wyman and David Cuadros) came to Enron to give us a demonstration of the gas interfaces.  HoustonStreet was allowed to load the required .cab files on the demonstration computers prior to the demonstration.  HoustonStreet provided us with a script to follow relative to the demonstration as well as a list of test and production mappings.  During the demonstration we experienced the following:
1 - 8 second delays between a price update on EnronOnline and a price update on HoustonStreet.  With just five products active we experienced a delay of up to 5 seconds.  Due to the delay in price updates, transaction attempts on the HoustonStreet platform resulted in a high percentage of failed transactions with Enron.
When we activated Product ID 16612 (US Gas Basis PEPL Jun-Oct01) the product showed up on EnronOnline but did not show up on HoustonStreet.  HoustonStreet provided us with a list of products which had been mapped in the test environment and this product was included on the list.  HoustonStreet indicated that they had verified the mapping of all the products on this list.  We reviewed the mapping of this product by Enron and confirmed that it was active and mapped.  Incorrect mapping of products has the potential of allowing transactions to occur with mismatched product types.
When we attempted to transact on Product ID 16600 (US Gas Basis NGI Chicago Jun-Oct01) we were unable to complete a transaction even when the bid and offer prices were not changing.  These transaction attempts should have resulted in successful transactions.  We also experience instances where the bid and/or offer price would disappear after a failed transaction attempt and not reappear even thought the price was still present on EnronOnline.  In many cases the price would disappear for up to 30 seconds or more.  Although we did not witness any incorrect transactions, general functionality failure may or may not result in incorrect transactions.  At a minimum this type of behavior would result in frustration on the part of the counterparty when a transaction attempt results in a failure with no subsequent price move or a disappearing price.
A review of the transactions we recorded versus the transactions indicated by HoustonStreet reveals some discrepancies.  In an email from John Wyman dated 5/23 (forwarded seperately), John Wyman indicated that they had cleaned their database just prior to 3:00 PM and gave us just the trade count beginning at 14:58 on 5/22.  Although there has not been a deal by deal reconciliation of the trades, we compared our total trade count beginning at 14:58.  If the deal counts do not match this would result in substantial financial exposure.  Below I have highlighted the HoustonStreet transactions by counterparty versus the EnronOnline transaction count:
HSE	EOL
Arizona		 12	 14
Avista		 03	 03
Adams		 17	 19
BP		 57	 58
Total		 89	 94
Based upon my review of the demonstration, I continue to believe there significant potential exposure associated with the HoustonStreet interfaces.

as provide them with up to date information on all the potential rotations in
ENA.  Additionally, we would like to provide the ENA AA's a forum for your
respective groups to promote your business unit as a viable alternative in
the rotation process.  I need your assistance for this endeavor and want your
respective business unit to participate in the process by delivering an
informal presentation to the AA group which should include the following:

Your business unit's current activities, purpose and interfaces with other
departments
Recent successes and current projects
Ideas on the horizon
Opportunities in your business unit for AA's
The benifits of rotation in your business unit
An open Q&A session

These presentations should be informal and it is not necessary to have
handouts.  The goal is to provide an open forum for the AA's and to have them
ask questions about each business unit.  Also, bringing one of your current
AA's with you to provide their insight might help stimulate discussion.  Ted
Bland will be contacting you to schedule your business unit for a
presentation.  The first "brownbag" will take place September 8 between
12:00pm and 1:00pm in Room 30 C1.

This reports on our meet and confer session with the AG's office today
regarding the subpoenas served upon Enron Energy Services. Mike Kirby and I
spoke with Deputy AGs Margaret Wrighter and Paul Stein for approximately two
hours.  These are the essential points we covered:
*	Non-waiver of objections:  They agreed that EES did not waive any
objections by attempting to negotiate compliance with the subpoena.  They
will agree that any interim production of  documents would not waive any of
EES's objections to the subpoena, except as to those documents actually
produced.
*	Territoriality:  We told them that EES would not produce documents
that resided outside the state.  Much of the conference was devoted to their
disagreement with this position.  Wrighter suggested that the AG may seek
prompt court relief on this issue or, in the alternative, file a lawsuit to
make EES a party in this litigation, then reach out of state documents
through ordinary discovery.  We are at an impasse on this issue.
*	Confidentiality:  The AG proposes a confidentiality order identical
to the order in place between Reliant and Dynegy in their litigation with
the AG in Los Angeles.  This order limits access to confidential documents
to less than 20 persons, but provides that persons outside the AG's office
at the PUC and other California governmental agencies may review produced
documents. The court in LA  has recently ruled that the confidentiality in
place with Reliant and Dynegy and Mirant may be amended to permit the
offices of the Attorneys General of Oregon and Washington to review produced
documents, subject to the confidentiality provisions of the agreement.
Reliant and Dynergy are challenging this provision of the order in the
appellate courts, but have not obtained an order staying their production
under this order.  The AG says they will not sign a different
confidentiality order with us.  We did not agree to these provisions.  We
are to give the AG a redlined confidentiality order on Monday that we would
accept in return for producing documents within California.
*	Production of electronic documents:  They insist that all documents
kept in electronic form be produced in  electronic form.  We discussed the
difficulties and burdens of doing this.  They say they will insist upon this
requirement.  We will consider compliance for electronic documents within
the state if it is not burdensome to do so.
*	Confidentiality of customer contracts:  They will agree to narrow
production to commercial customers. We explained that our commercial
contracts have confidentiality provisions with our customers.  We told them
most have approximately a ten day notice period which we will honor.  They
asked for an example of this provision, which I said we would provide. They
took the position that we should have been given notice to our customers
weeks ago and demanded production.  We told them we would not do so until,
at the earliest, July 30, after we had given appropriate notice.  They asked
that we begin to produce some documents before then.
*	Interim production: We told them that, subject to an acceptable
confidentiality order, we were prepared to produce documents which were
reasonably requested by their subpoena that reside within California
beginning July 30,  on the condition that it would not operate as a waiver
of any of our objections in later litigation. They said they would think
about this offer and call us back.  Wrighter called back this afternoon,
saying that they wish us to continue with the plans to make an interim
production. She did not promise not to file a lawsuit in the interim.
Accordingly, we intend to prepare an acceptable confidentiality
agreement sufficient to protect the  production of EES's California
documents, then send it to the AG with a letter that set forth the terms of
any interim production under that agreement. If they do not agree to the
confidentiality agreement, or the terms of the interim production, we will
not produce any documents. We will send this letter to the AG early next

It appears that the following email may not have been clear.  You have to copy all documents yourself.

This is my cheat sheet if it helps:

H Drives:
1.  Each person will have to move any data over personally from the old H drive (which is now Z:) drive to their new H drive.
2. The Z: drive (old H:) will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M  pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

Grigsby's SoCal book was transferred to Phillip Allen for liquidation.  Grigsby will be responsible for trading the gas daily book.

Lessons learned:
Grigsby doubled down at the top of the market, (see price graph below, light blue line).
The element of time.  While the fundamental analysis regarding storage looks correct, the timing of the trade appears to have been too early.
Core and non core SoCal customers
o	Core - The West desk fundamental analysis considered only the core users, who can't/wont forward hedge because their price risk is inherently tied to index.  This being the case, there is sentiment is that the trade will return,  however the time between today and then is too long, too risky.
o	Non Core - Analysis here did not truly recognize that the non core customer base can/will in fact forward hedge, or that their hedging would have a material impact on the curve.  It is my understanding that these non core customers are selling gas and buying power in the back of the curve, (note both NP-15 power prices and SoCal have dropped from mid-March) and in the front of the gas curve,  they are buying.
As an aside - as the political rhetoric heats up, the market place appears to be getting jittery --that while nothing will be done tomorrow, something may in fact be done in the long run, impacting prices.

I spoke with Grigsby regarding any other large counter parties that may be experiencing similar "pain" and he said that basically Enron is the only one, so it appears as if counterparty credit risks are minimal.

The East desk's No. 1 priority for RTOs is The Real Time Energy Market (no
day ahead balanced schedule requirement).  This means that the RTO should
post the supply and demand curve with real time prices (the best example at
this time is PJM's real time market).  A real time energy market is
fundamental for customers to get proper real time price signals upon which to
base their decisions to hedge or not on a forward basis.  It also provides
the proper price signals to the market on where generation and transmission
is needed.  Getting a real time energy market would advance Enron's ability
to provide more financial tools to customers.  This market can be nodal (or
zonal) in order to send location based price signals (for example, to NY
City), with the ability to aggregate from nodal to zone determined "proxy
buses."
While Kevin prefers the physical flowgate model with an option to collect
congestion revenues (rather than an obligation, similar to the PJM FTRs now),
the method of determining the congestion management is secondary to the
establishment of the real time energy market.  Regulatory people should use
their judgment (and talk with the desk) when determining how far to push
option-type flowgates, rather than obligation-type FTRs.  Such a physical
market transmission/congestion market can support a financial trading overlay.
If you do have an FTR type system, there should be an upfront allocation to
load.  Ideally, the load should have an "network" right from the generator to
their load (or from load to the "hubs") in order to have the ability to
manage the congestion risk in the forward market when serving end use
customers (EES) or for the ENA full requirements deals.  The nodes should be
grouped into logical "zones" and congestion within a zone should be uplifted.
This allocation to customers (or full blown auction of all rights) becomes
critical in Enron's ability to serve load and all requirements customers.
Without the proper allocation (not to incumbent utilties), the risk premium
to serve these customers becomes too high and can't be priced.
Finally, the market should have no price caps and preferably no icap market
like NEPOOL (prefer PJM's system where the load has to show the RTO that it
has contracted for enough reserves.)  We have urged the FERC in Florida to
adopt a reserve monitoring system, whereby customers are not penalized for
lack of icap unless they actually go under the reserve requirement, then they
are required to purchase icap for a certain amount of time until they
demonstrate continued compliance.
Bottom line -- "Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good."  Congestion
does not need to be perfectly allocated to each load if that mechanism is
done in a manner that precludes Enron and others from developing efficient
real time energy markets that send a locational hourly price signal to the
generation (supply) and the load (demand).  This type of market will provide
greater services to customers and allow Enron to grow its business.
Finally, as we work toward this goal, remember that in the absence of a
real-time energy market, we need to continue to focus our efforts on
non-discriminatory treatment with respect to transmission (no native load
exception) and parking and lending, scheduling flexibility, etc.

I have received preliminary information from D&B.  I think several
issues/questions have been raised that if explored, could result in a better
solution for the money.

Option 1
The update frequency for our current file can be improved from quarterly to
monthly for a cost of $87,000 (USD) through March, 2001.

Option 2
I wasn't sure what specific data in the file you might be interested in.  If
you are particularly interested in the Financial Stress Score and Credit
Score, for example, there are multiple alternatives :

2a) Keep quartlery refresh of base data (party name, etc) and refresh scores
that are added/changed on a monthly basis.  Cost - $1.17(USD) per
record.          Note that there are 575,000 records in the file currently
with financial and credit scores, making this potentially a very expensive
alternative
(575,000 X 1.17=$ 672,750).

2b) Batch or FTP updates of the financial and stress scores can only be
provided monthly.  D&B is working on a solution that would provide a
weekly         update to their customers in a batch or FTP manner, but has
not committed to when this will be ready.  Therefore, if more timely updates
than monthly                          are desired, it is also possible to
transactionally access records one at a time using D&B's software.  The cost
for this is extremely high at $10.52         (USD) per score.

Option 3
D&B Connect Product.
D&B Connect is a tool set of matching software, an externally validated
reference file, credit and marketing information, and D&B services that
enables the  most effective integration of customer information and
third-party information with D&B information.  Only this type of process and
information integration  capability can facilitate and ensure accurate
identification, linkage and maintenance of your customer's complete
relationship.   In addition, D&B Connect  assures organizations of
referential integrity by providing an automated and electronic link to D&B so
that the most recent D&B information is always  transmitted to your
organization and updated within your local D&B Connect Reference File.  D&B
Connect is scalable.

Cost Typically ranging from
* Customer Access Module (CAM) Batch- - $25,000
* CAM Online - $50,000
* Full Information Integrator - $350,000 + data

With more specifics as to your needs, this option should perhaps be pursued.


Questions/Issues

1) D&B had questions regarding the use of their data and whether Enron
customers would be offered this information for a fee or free.  I explained
that I  did not feel the data would be offered directly to Enron customers,
but that it would be used to support analysis that would be available
externally via web  site, etc.  All pricing above is based upon this
understanding.  If I have not portrayed the usage correctly, it will be
imperative to get a better understanding  before final pricing can be
negotiated.

2)  Are there specific data elements that you are interested in ?
Alternatives may vary by data element.  Financial Stress Score and Credit
Score reference  above were explored as an example.

3)  What is timeframe for needing a solution ?

4)  Financial Stress Score and Credit Score are only available on U.S.
companies.  A comparable measure - Global Failure Score (the liklihood of
default or  bankruptcy)  is available for international companies.  This
rating score however, is NOT currently available via a batch or FTP manner.
This could result  in additional cost if we wish to pursue obtaining this
score in a batch manner.

5)  Pricing also varies whether the information is to be used for credit
analysis or risk management decisions versus for marketing purposes.  This is
probably  negotiable as the data is the same.  The thought process is that if
the repository is used for credit or risk decisions, D&B will see decreased
usage and  revenue on a transactional basis by the credit departments.

DWR now has authorization to buy down load at market prices.
Press Release
OFFICE OF THE GOVERNOR
PR01: 285
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
06/10/2001
GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE
Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans
LOS ANGELES
Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary,
emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large
businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power
emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating
customers.
"Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor
Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even
avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources
to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they
voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."
The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent
load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent
System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned
Utilities.
The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer
2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be
determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the
amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated
to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of
customers who sign up.

Chevron and Texaco Agree to $100 Billion Merger

Chevron Corp. and Texaco Inc. announced plans to merge and ChevronTexaco
Corp.

In the merger, Texaco shareholders will receive 0.77 shares of Chevron
common stock for each share of Texaco common stock they own, and Chevron
shareholders will retain their existing shares.  The exchange ratio
represents approximately $64.87 per Texaco share based on Chevron's closing
stock price of $84.25 on October 13.  The exchange ratio represents an 18%
premium based upon Texaco's closing share price on October 13, and a 25%
premium based upon the two companies' average relative share prices during
the 30-day period through October 13.  As a result of the merger, Chevron
shareholders will own approximately 61% of the combined equity, and Texaco
shareholders will own about 39%.  The combined company would have an
enterprise value of more than $100 billion.

The new company will have reserves of 11.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent
(BOE), daily production of 2.7 million BOE, assets of $77 billion, and
operations throughout the world.  In the U.S.,  ChevronTexaco would be the
nation's third largest producer of oil and gas, with production of 1.1
million BOE per day, and hold the nation's third largest reserve position,
with 4.2 billion BOE of proved reserves.

The Enron Management Conference will be held Wednesday through Friday, November 14-16, 2001, at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the business agenda is still being finalized, there is one thing that is certain ... we want to inject some humor into the event.  The past year has been eventful, and at times challenging, for Enron and its employees.  However, it's not in Enron's corporate fabric to focus on the past.  Instead, we want to look ahead, and even laugh at ourselves.  The Management Conference will provide a platform for just that.

We want to challenge each of the business units to develop and submit a humorous "Home Video" to be presented at the Management Conference.  The video can address any Enron-related topic that your business unit chooses.  However, there are a few rules to follow.
1.) The videos should be no more than five minutes long.
2.) Business units should spend as little as possible on the videos, and no more than $10,000.  Innovision Communications (Beth Stier) has agreed to work with any business unit to help them create an original, inexpensive video.  Innovision can be contacted at 713-446-4424.
3.) The videos should be fun, but not disparaging.  They should adhere to Enron's values of respect, integrity, communication and excellence.
4.)  By Monday, October 15, business units need to notify me of their intention to submit a video.  To avoid duplication, business units will also need to identify a topic they intend to address.
5.) To ensure inclusion in the Management Conference agenda, videos need to be submitted to me by Friday, November 9.
6.)  Awards will be given for creativity and humor.  The first annual, and soon-to-be-coveted, "Enny" will also be awarded for "Best Overall Video."

If you have any questions about the "Home Video" project, please contact myself or Mary Clark.

Davis insists on energy refunds
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published June 21, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gray Davis demanded Wednesday that power generators refund
California nearly $9 billion in electricity charges.
"It is unconscionable for the generators to profit from their egregious
overcharges," Davis told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
Davis' testimony highlighted a change in political tactics in the state's
power crisis after a Monday order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
expanding wholesale price relief for California and 10 other Western states.
And the governor got some support from two FERC members who said Wednesday
that they are prepared to order California's energy suppliers to make heavy
refunds because of overcharging.
But the two commissioners -- Pat Wood III and William Massey -- agreed with
their FERC colleagues that California officials and energy companies should
be given a chance to settle the multibillion-dollar refund dispute in the
next three weeks before the commission acts, the Washington Post reported.
During his testimony, Davis gave tepid praise to FERC, which he said "finally
took a positive step" in imposing the limits. But he continued to press the
independent agency to recover what he said were overcharges.
"The FERC has been on a sit-down strike ... because we haven't received a
dime," Davis said.
The commission's action on price controls has been well-received, diminishing
appeals among West Coast Democratic governors and lawmakers and a handful of
Republicans for congressionally mandated caps.
But the commission's order didn't quiet demands that generators be required
to pay back overcharges, and Davis led the charge Wednesday to exploit that
issue.
Davis said the California Independent System Operator, the Folsom-based
agency that manages the state's power grid, found the state was billed $8.9
billion more than the competitive market would have warranted for power
deliveries for the 13 months ending June 1.
Davis insisted that FERC move promptly to "order the energy companies to give
back the money," and that Congress should help pressure the agency to do so.
"I do believe that FERC should get a clear signal on refunds from this
committee," Davis told the Democrat-controlled panel during a hearing into
whether FERC has responded properly to the crisis.
The energy commission has ordered reviews of about $124 million in potential
overcharges in the past several months. But that amount is dwarfed by the
$8.9 billion that Davis is now seeking in refunds.
While the commission is continuing to review possible overcharges, it has yet
to order a single dollar in refunds. The power generators deny they have
overcharged California, saying market conditions and the utilities' shaky
credit ratings warranted high prices.
Wood and Massey, who talked to the Post after their testimony Wednesday
before the committee, said they are ready to require generators and marketers
to refund revenue that exceeded the price ceilings imposed by FERC on Monday.
"We should have given (the California parties) guidance on refunds," Massey
told the Post. "A good place to start was to take (Monday's) order and apply
it starting October 2000 and see what you get" in refunds.
Depending on the time period and whether private generators and municipal
utilities would be required to pay, the refunds could exceed $1 billion, some
energy attorneys calculated Wednesday.
In its Monday order, the commission said it wanted all the parties to sit
down with an administrative law judge to see if they could work out a refunds
settlement. The settlement conference begins Monday.
Commission Chairman Curt Hebert told the Senate panel at Wednesday's hearing
that if no deal is reached after three weeks, the commission would seek
advice from the judge on how it might order a resolution.
"The commission stands ready to act expeditiously," Hebert pledged.
While Davis took the offensive at Wednesday's hearing, Republicans didn't
give him a free ride. The Republican National Committee passed out hand fans
touted as "Gray Davis' solution for summer blackouts."
The fans were paid for by a small Sacramento Republican consulting firm, MB
Associates.
The questioning by the committee's chairman, Sen. Joe Lieberman of
Connecticut, and other Democrats was friendly. But Republicans tried to paint
Davis as the culprit in a crisis he could have solved a year ago.
"How did you let things get totally out of hand?" asked Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's senior Republican.
Davis said his administration began the push to build new generating plants
to meet the impending power shortage four months after he took office in
1999.
"I make no apologies for the aggressive actions we've taken," the governor
said.
Republican lawmakers warned that demanding refunds could actually add to
California's power woes if energy investors become spooked about sanctions
and take their business elsewhere -- resulting in a decreased electricity
supply.
Under pointed questioning from Thompson, Davis shot back.
"The people I represent are mad. They want us to fight back," Davis said.
"... Obviously, we want the state to be an attractive place for investment.
But we don't want companies walking all over our citizens."
Separately, the top Republican on the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources
Committee said it was unrealistic -- and perhaps unfair -- for Davis to
expect FERC to immediately order refunds.
"They're going to have to go back to court and prove these charges that,
indeed, there was manipulation in the marketing of power. And that's going to
be very difficult to do," said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
Even if a refund deal is reached, it's uncertain how much of an effect it
might have. Of the $8.9 billion identified by the ISO, roughly two-thirds of
that was incurred by California utilities that still owe generators billions
of dollars for past power deliveries.
Hebert also noted that ratepayers in other Western states would have to be
included in refund considerations.
Meanwhile, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said
Wednesday that because of FERC's action, they were pulling back their bill,
at least for now, to require that wholesale prices in the West be set at the
cost of production, plant by plant, plus a margin of profit.
However, House Democrats said that while they were happy the commission had
taken action, they still want a vote on a tougher price-cap proposal offered
by Democratic Reps. Jay Inslee of Washington and Nancy Pelosi of San
Francisco.

Energy Digest: State moves to tax plants


(Published June 21, 2001)
In a move aimed at squeezing more tax revenue from large in-state power
generators, the state Board of Equalization on Wednesday edged closer to
stripping local governments of their authority to tax power plants.
State Controller Kathleen Connell, a member of the board, proposed that the
state take over the assessments.
The amount local governments may assess power plants is limited by
Proposition 13, but the state is able to place higher values on the
properties.
Supporters of the move say the state could collect $70 million to $100
million more than local governments.
But the board's staff, while acknowledging that the state could extract more
from power plants than local governments during the current energy crisis,
said it is unclear what would happen to the price of power and value of power
plants in the future.
Local governments, worried that the new assessment system could shortchange
their revenues, opposed the move. But the board, which voted unanimously to
give the plan tentative approval, said the Legislature intends to distribute
the power plant money as though it were taxed locally.
Plants producing fewer than 50 megawatts and co-generation facilities would
be exempted from the rule change. The bill closely resembles AB 81 by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which has been approved by the
Assembly and awaits Senate action.

Davis demands nearly $9 billion for electricity overcharges



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 20, 2001
WASHINGTON ) California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund
nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal
regulators have "looked the other way while energy companies bilked our
state."
Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and 10 other
Western states was a step forward. "But its actions do nothing about the
overcharges" over the past year, he said.
The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans, who charge he
has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand.

Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis




Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up approval for new
power plants and strengthened conservation programs. He also said the state
has little control over price gouging by out-of-state power generators.
"The governor once said he could solve California's problems in 15 minutes.
... But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true
cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities,"
putting California taxpayers in jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.
Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities
not under FERC jurisdiction
Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee,
said the FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity sales, has been slow to
respond and "surprisingly reluctant" to assure that electricity prices are
just and reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.
The agency's response to the Western power problem "raises serious questions
about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy
markets" not only in the West but across the rest of the country.
The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in the day,
imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in California and 10 other
Western states from Washington to Arizona. The agency also ordered the
parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on
overcharges and other issues.
Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged overcharges by power
generators. The power companies have since challenged the agency's findings
and the matter remains in dispute.
"To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California,"
complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and the beginning of this
month power generators are believed to have overcharged California $8.9
billion.
"They must be required to give us back our money," said Davis. "It is
unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked
our state for up to $9 billion."
The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27 billion in 2000
and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this year, said Davis. "Power
generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market," he
said.
Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the
problem. He said newly approved power plants will provide 20,000 additional
megawatts of electricity by 2003, including 4,000 megawatts by the end of
this summer. "Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable
energy to California is being done ... except wholesale price relief," he
said.
"This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more months," said Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President Bush's repeated refusal to urge
the FERC to mitigate electricity prices. Bush has strongly opposed price
controls, although he indicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation
effort this week.
Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that
businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC press its
investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California
but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity prices have also skyrocketed.
Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on
the cost of generation at individual power plants.
"Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price
is laughable," said Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the committee's ranking
Republican. Hard price caps "don't work when supply is the problem. ... They
make a bad situation worse," he said.
After FERC issued its limited price control order this week, Senate Democrats
on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent
cost-based price caps on Western electricity sales.
Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to pursue a bill
requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.




Davis spars with GOP senators over electricity rates



By Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 20, 2001
WASHINGTON ) California Gov. Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans
Wednesday as he blamed federal regulators for averting their gaze from an
alleged $9 billion scheme to bilk the state's electricity consumers.
Testifying in front of the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Davis
demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order power
companies to refund the overcharges. But the governor also found himself
obliged to ward off GOP claims that Davis' own policies triggered the state's
energy crisis.
The partisan give-and-take reflected the mounting political stakes involved
in California's plight. With both parties preparing for next year's
congressional elections, the subtext of Davis' testimony appeared to involve
a recognition that the state's energy problems could affect the outcome of
several California races.
"How did you let things get so totally out of hand?" asked Sen. Fred Thompson
of Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, as he greeted Davis who
made a long-awaited appearance here after weeks of transcontinental sniping
over assigning responsibility for the state's energy woes.
Thompson's question could have been lifted from the script of a $1.5 million
GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that
attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis.
Davis' rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power
on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation.
"We've been working on this for a very long time, and to suggest otherwise
would be inaccurate," he told Thompson.
Saying that he is determined to hold "FERC's feet to the fire" on the refund
issue, Davis complained to the committee, "It is unconscionable that the
commission looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for
up to $9 billion."
Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground with
California voters since the electricity crisis hit, but Wednesday's round of
activities here found him on the offensive.
"Obviously, this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him,"
observed Norm Ornstein, a congressional affairs expert at the American
Enterprise Institute.
Several hours after Davis completed his testimony, the five FERC
commissioners appeared before the committee, but they largely ignored the
governor's accusations.
On Monday, FERC issued an order restricting energy prices in California and
much of the West for the next 15 months and setting up a procedure for
reviewing refund claims.
"The commission is not ducking these issues," said FERC Chairman Curtis L.
Hebert.
However, there remains a substantial gap between Davis' calculation of
electricity overcharges in California and the $124.5 million in refunds
assessed so far by FERC.
The struggle over refunds will enter a new phase on Monday when the review
procedure outlined by FERC will begin before FERC's chief administrative law
judge, Curtis L. Wagner Jr. Pairing off against the power companies will be
senior officials of the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
power grid.
Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the $9 billion
estimate of California's electricity overcharge.
"To date, not a single penny has been returned to Californians," Davis told
the committee. "It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep
these egregious overcharges."
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gouging,
and Davis said later he would anticipate "some strong action coming out of
his office before the end of the summer."
Davis expects to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bush's two new FERC GOP
appointees, Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell, about "natural gas discrepancies"
in California.
"California was paying two to three times more in natural gas, and the
president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed," Davis told a
press conference after meeting with the California congressional delegation.
Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, and Darrell Issa, R-Vista, were among the
Republicans who met with Davis.
"It was a good meeting with the governor," Hunter said, adding that FERC "has
taken steps to lock down prices, and the results speak for themselves. I
think we are all working together, and it's a good sense of common ground."
That was not the mood in the committee hearing, however.
Sparring with Davis, Thompson argued that there had been ample advance
warnings of the crisis, including a 1998 report foreseeing an imminent energy
shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of
economic growth spurred by the energy-intensive high-tech industry.
"Did you see those developments?" Thompson asked. "Did they cause you
concern?"
Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor, Gov. Pete Wilson,
and the State Legislature that designed an energy deregulation plan now
widely recognized as having been seriously flawed.
However, he said those problems did not become apparent until last year.
Thompson also criticized Davis' recent rhetoric castigating the power
companies for price gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by
dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the state's
power infrastructure.
"The people I represent are mad," replied Davis. "They want us to fight back
and that's what I'm doing."
He said he is determined that the state cease serving as "a cash cow to a lot
of energy companies."





Poway not proceeding on power plant proposal



Council worried about financial burden
By Brian E. Clark
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
POWAY -- Citing financial risks, the City Council has pulled the plug on a
proposed $40 million power plant in the South Poway Business Park.
Though there was no formal vote, Mayor Mickey Cafagna told City Manager Jim
Bowersox -- who was lukewarm at best to the proposed plant -- that his staff
should not spend any more time or money on the project.
So-called "peaker" plants are small, less-efficient plants that can produce
up to 50 megawatts of electricity. Usually they run only several hours a day,
when demand is greatest.
At the council meeting Tuesday night, Cafagna said he saw little reason to
invest in the plant, especially since there are no guarantees that Poway
could claim any of the power it produced.
Instead, he said the city should monitor a plan put forth by Rep. Duncan
Hunter, R-El Cajon, that would coordinate the use of diesel generators owned
by large businesses to help avoid the blackouts that are expected to plague
the state this summer.
If the council had chosen to proceed with the peaker-plant proposal -- an
idea it first explored in March -- it would have had to pay San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. up to $30,000 to go through the application process. An
additional $70,000 would have been authorized for a consultant.
Those two figures made City Council members blanch.
"I'm not willing to commit any of the public's money on this," said
Councilwoman Betty Rexford. "I think it would be better for the city to be
handing out energy-efficient light bulbs to save energy."




Campaign helps seniors bear summer



Program to use stickers identifying 'cool zones'
By Anne Krueger
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
During a heat wave or rolling blackout this summer, look to the polar bear
for relief.
The bear is on a decal that will be placed at the entrances of about 60
buildings around San Diego County that have been designated as "cool zones."
The program kicks off today, the first day of summer.
The cool zones were the idea of Supervisor Dianne Jacob. She was looking for
a way to offer relief to seniors and the disabled who are particularly
vulnerable to heat exhaustion and dehydration.
Jacob said she was concerned that many seniors might not use their air
conditioners this summer because of high electric bills. Or they would have
to suffer through a power outage during a rolling blackout.
She said she wants to avoid a disaster like the one in Chicago in 1995. More
than 500 residents, most of them elderly, died when the power went out during
a heat wave.
The buildings identified as cool zones include senior centers, libraries,
enclosed shopping malls, and even courthouses. Some of the cool zones, such
as senior centers or libraries, may have planned programs, but other
buildings will simply provide a place to get out of the heat.
"If people want to read on their own or knit or chat, at least there will be
places for them to cool off," said Denise Nelesen, spokeswoman for the county
Office of Aging and Independence Services, which is coordinating the program.
Many of the buildings designated as cool zones are popular spots already. At
Parkway Plaza in El Cajon, 79-year-old William Richards of North Park sat on
a bench sipping a soda. He said that although he lives closer to Fashion
Valley, an outdoor mall in Mission Valley, he prefers Parkway Plaza, in part,
because it's enclosed.
"It's more comfortable," Richards said. "It's just a nice place to walk
around."
The Lemon Grove Senior Center is getting a polar bear sticker, too. Even
without the air-conditioning turned on. Officials there are prudently waiting
for the heat to hit before flipping the switch.
A group of women played mah-jongg there Tuesday as a breeze came through the
open door. "We'll be glad to share our space, if it's cool," said Eve Butler.
Jacob said providing transportation to cool zones is still a problem that
hasn't been worked out. She said money may be available through the state
Public Utilities Commission.
Nelesen said the county also is helping shut-in seniors through its Project
Care program, in which the seniors receive a regular phone call to check on
their welfare. Mail carriers and utility workers are being trained to look
for signs that a senior may require assistance, Nelesen said.




Business leaders unite to back new SDG&E line



Coalition to lobby for transmission plan
By Jeff McDonald
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
A group of San Diego business leaders have formed a coalition to promote a
major improvement to the San Diego Gas & Electric transmission grid.
The utility is seeking approval for a 500,000-volt transmission line that
would run from southwest Riverside County to north San Diego County. SDG&E
hopes to have the so-called Valley Rainbow Interconnect in place by 2004.
San Diego business executives plan to lobby state energy regulators to
approve the 30-mile set of looming poles and high-voltage wires in order to
boost capacity along the SDG&E transmission network.
"The Valley Rainbow Interconnect will ensure a reliable delivery of power for
San Diegans for years to come," said Jessie Knight Jr. of the San Diego
Regional Chamber of Commerce.
The collection of business leaders includes chamber officials as well as
executives of the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council and the San Diego
Economic Development Corp.
Calling themselves the San Diego County Valley Rainbow Alliance, members plan
to testify at California Public Utilities Commission meetings on behalf of
the project.
Three community hearings have been scheduled by the CPUC to solicit input on
the proposal from residents of San Diego and Riverside counties. They were
scheduled in Pauma Valley and the Riverside County communities of Winchester
and Temecula.
No organized opposition to the network has surfaced in San Diego County.
But a group of Temecula Valley area residents have spent months fighting the
project. Among other things, they worry about the effect that the
long-planned series of 190-foot poles might have on their property values.
The CPUC held a hearing last night at the Pauma Valley Community Center.
Another hearing on the application will be held at 6:30 tonight at the
Temecula Community Recreation Center.

Governor adamant on refund at hearing



Davis, on Capitol Hill visit, deflects blame for shortages
Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 21, 2001
WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans yesterday as he
blamed federal regulators for ignoring what he said was a $9 billion scheme
by power companies to bilk Californians.
Testifying before the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Davis demanded
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order power companies to refund
the overcharges.
But the governor was forced to respond to Republican claims that his policies
turned a solveable problem into a full-blown energy crisis.
The partisan give-and-take reflected the mounting political stakes involved
in California's plight. The subtext of Davis' testimony involved a
recognition that the state's energy problems could affect the outcome of
several California House races next year, as well as the governor's own
re-election.
"How did you let things get so totally out of hand?" Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, asked Davis.
Thompson's question could have been lifted from the script of a $1.5 million
GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that
attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis. The campaign
follows weeks of criticism by Davis of federal regulators and of President
Bush for failing to address the energy problem.
Davis' rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power
on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation.
"We've been working on this for a very long time, and to suggest otherwise
would be inaccurate," he told Thompson.
The Democratic governor said he is determined to hold "FERC's feet to the
fire" on the refund issue.
"It is unconscionable that the commission looked the other way while energy
companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion," he said.
Davis' grievances received more attention here than they might have just
weeks ago, before Democrats took control of the Senate and its committees
after Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont bolted the Republican Party to become an
independent. A sympathetic committee chairman, Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman
of Connecticut, made Davis the star witness of yesterday's hearing.
Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground with
California voters since the electricity crisis hit, but Republicans have
acknowledged that Davis and Democrats in recent weeks have gained the upper
hand over the Bush administration in the energy debate.
Despite some GOP criticism yesterday, Davis was clearly on the offensive.
"Obviously, this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him,"
observed Norm Ornstein, a congressional affairs expert at the American
Enterprise Institute.
Several hours after Davis completed his testimony, the five FERC
commissioners appeared before the committee, but they largely ignored the
governor's accusations.
On Monday, FERC issued an order to control energy prices in California and
much of the West for the next 15 months and to set up a procedure for
reviewing refund claims.
"The commission is not ducking these issues," said FERC Chairman Curtis
Hebert.
However, there remains a substantial gap between Davis' calculation of
electricity overcharges in California and the $124.5 million in refunds
assessed so far by FERC, which have been contested by power generators.
The struggle over refunds enters a new phase Monday when the review procedure
outlined by FERC will begin before the commission's chief administrative law
judge, Curtis Wagner Jr. Facing off against the power companies will be
senior officials of the Independent System Operator, which runs the
California power grid.
Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the $9 billion
estimate of California's electricity overcharge.
"To date, not a single penny has been returned to Californians," Davis told
the committee. "It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep
these egregious overcharges."
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., yesterday introduced legislation to provide for
refunds.
The power companies, although acknowledging huge profits, have denied
allegations of price gouging or market manipulation.
"There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone," Mark
Stultz, a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association, told the
Associated Press.
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gouging,
and Davis said after the hearing he anticipated "some strong action" from
Lockyer in the next few months.
Davis said he plans to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bush's two new FERC
appointees, Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell, about "natural gas discrepancies"
in California. Davis said California has been paying up to three times more
for natural gas than elsewhere in the country.
"The president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed," Davis
told a reporters after meeting with the California congressional delegation.
Reps. Duncan Hunter of El Cajon and Darrell Issa of Vista were among the
Republicans who met with Davis.
"It was a good meeting with the governor," Hunter said, adding that FERC "has
taken steps to lock down prices, and the results speak for themselves. I
think we are all working together, and it's a good sense of common ground."
That was not the mood in the committee hearing, however.
Sparring with Davis, Thompson argued that there had been ample advance
warnings of the crisis. He noted a 1998 report forecasting an imminent energy
shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of
economic growth spurred by the energy-intensive high-tech industry.
"Did you see those developments?" Thompson asked. "Did they cause you
concern?"
Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson, and the state Legislature, which approved an energy deregulation plan
now widely recognized as seriously flawed.
However, he said those problems did not become apparent until last year.
Thompson also criticized Davis' recent rhetoric castigating the power
companies for price-gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by
dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the state's
power infrastructure.
"The people I represent are mad," replied Davis. "They want us to fight back
and that's what I'm doing."
He said he is determined that the state cease serving as "a cash cow to a lot
of energy companies."





Little-known transmission company has billion-dollar backers



By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 20, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Through an alliance with a little-known start-up company,
General Electric Co. is trying to enter California's transmission lines
business.
Although Trans-Elect, a two-year-old company based in Washington, has no
experience in the transmission business, it has the financial support of GE's
$66 billion financial arm, GE Capital. Trans-Elect's latest offer comes as
Gov. Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the
transmission lines of both San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California
Edison.
Any involvement by GE in the state's transmission grid could be a conflict of
interest, said a key lawmaker involved in the efforts to end California's
yearlong power crisis.
"You've got someone with generation and transmission systems, how do they
keep them separate and do they?" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder
Creek. "That's a concern for me. Would they have the ability to restrict
competitors' access to transmissions?"
Trans-Elect first made overtures to buy the transmission lines in February,
offering more than $5 billion for those owned by SDG&E, Edison and Pacific
Gas and Electric.
Although Davis has reached a deal with Edison to buy their lines for $2.76
billion and a $1 billion pact with SDG&E, Trans-Elect has said it will offer
Edison $1.8 billion and SDG&E $700 million.
Bob Mitchell, Trans-Elect's vice president, said the company made its offer
believing that the Legislature won't approve the deals to buy the two
utilities' lines.
GE joined forces with Trans-Elect March 14, when GE Capital Services
Structured Finances Group Inc. announced it had bought a minority stake in
the company. Neither company would reveal the size of the investment.
But a GE statement said its investment enables "GE Capital Global Energy to
co-invest with Trans-Elect as it acquires transmission assets throughout the
U.S."
Now, however, both GE and Trans-Elect are trying to downplay their
relationship.
Ken Koprowski, a GE spokesman, said the company made "a small financial
investment and we're not involved in the management of the company." He added
that the company invests in many other energy projects, including power
plants.
"There's no connection with what we're doing in California and GE," Mitchell
said.
What Koprowski and Mitchell call a low-profile arrangement has generated
lobbying activity. Several lawmakers said they had met with Mitchell about
Trans-Elect's offer.
GE Capital hired lobbyist Phillip Schott a week after investing in
Trans-Elect. Schott referred calls to GE's lobbyist, Kahl/Pownall Advocates,
one of California's biggest political lobbying firms. Fred Pownall,
Kahl/Pownall's head, referred all questions on the bill to GE Capital
headquarters.
In California, many hurdles remain for Trans-Elect. First, the Legislature
would have to kill the deals with SDG&E and Edison. Then the companies would
have to turn to Trans-Elect to buy their lines.
So far, utility leaders are skeptical. Edison CEO John Bryson rejected the
Trans-Elect offer Tuesday, calling it a "phony" bid by an unknown company.
"We don't know this company. I suppose nobody does," Bryson said at a town
hall meeting in Los Angeles. The reason the transmission lines are in the
deal "is that we consider it our responsibility to try to stay serving our
customers as a healthy utility."
Other than the governor's offer, the transmission system isn't for sale,
Bryson said.
Trans-Elect remains interested in investing in California, but has postponed
sending a letter offering $1.8 billion for Edison's lines, Mitchell said.
"I think it's potentially an attractive deal, when we can create the right
climate for it," Mitchell said. "From the perspective of the people of
California, it's one less financial obligation they have to take on."
The Memorandum of Understanding between Edison and the governor needs
legislative approval by August, and many lawmakers have balked at the plan.
Keeley said he isn't convinced that selling the assets to a private company
is the best long-term solution for the state.
"I'm not prepared at this stage to believe that we should sell something as
significant as the transmission system to an entity that is not regulated by
the state and where our ability to have anything to say about the
transmission system is in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's venue,"
he said.
Should the Davis plan fail, Mitchell says his offer would remain.
"It appears to me and many other people that the Legislature is not going to
allow the people of California to pay an excessively high price," he said.
The $1.8 billion offer is "a very strong price."
Mitchell said he doesn't blame the utilities for rejecting his initial
offers, since the governor has promised more. But he stressed that the
company has a future in the industry, and plans to go public eventually.
Formed in 1998, Trans-Elect is trying to be the country's first national
transmission company. As utilities deregulate, they are allowed to sell
assets, including the transmission lines.
The American Transmission Company, a private transmission company based in
Wisconsin, has a similar mission as Trans-Elect, but not the level of
financial backing, said ATC spokeswoman Maripat Blankenheim.
"They're out there out with a really big check book," she said.




Davis Asks for Energy Refund Help
Power: Governor urges U.S. Senate action to get "back the money that was
wrongly taken from us."

By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON--California Gov. Gray Davis, seeking to shift the focus of
the energy debate, urged Congress on Wednesday to turn up the political heat
on federal regulators to help California recover $9 billion in estimated
overcharges by power generators.
Davis told a Senate panel that the order issued Monday by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to limit Western electricity prices was "a step
in the right direction." But more aggressive action is needed, he said, to
"give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us."




Gov. Gray Davis wipes his brow outside the Capitol after discussing his
remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

Davis' remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee suggest that
the political warfare between Sacramento and Washington did not end with
FERC's decision to police wholesale electricity prices more aggressively.
By demanding federal intervention to recover money already paid to power
generators, Davis continued to insist that the Bush administration and
federal regulators must share responsibility for solving the state's energy
problems.
"Yes, they have provided some relief," Davis said of FERC's price
mitigation mandate. "But that's only half the job. The other half of the job
is give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us."
On his first trip to Capitol Hill since Democrats took control of the
Senate, Davis appeared before a Governmental Affairs Committee that displayed
more sympathy toward his administration than it did when Republicans ruled it.
One committee member, fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey,
bluntly warned FERC: "We are watching how the people of California are
treated, and we are watching very, very closely."
Davis noted that federal regulators have already determined that
wholesale power rates charged to California were "unjust and unreasonable."
Even so, he said, "not a single penny in refunds has been returned to
California."

Governor Calls Rates 'Egregious'
"It's unconscionable if generators are allowed to keep these egregious
overcharges," Davis said, imploring the committee to "hold FERC's feet to the
fire."
California's electricity grid operator has calculated that the state
paid about $9 billion more than a competitive market would warrant for
electricity from May 2000 to May 2001. So far, FERC has only identified about
$124 million in possible overcharges, which were confined to January and
February.
To some extent, FERC has already agreed to play a bigger role in seeking
refunds, although not necessarily the full $9 billion that Davis is seeking.
Next week, representatives of the state, electric utilities and power
generating companies are scheduled to begin talks in Washington on possible
refunds.




California Gov. Gray Davis testifies before a Senate committee. He implored
its members to "hold FERC's feet to the fire." AFP

The settlement conference, which begins Monday, is scheduled to run for
15 consecutive days, including weekends, which is unusual for a regulatory
proceeding.
Presiding over the conference will be Chief Administrative Law Judge
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., who admonished participants Wednesday to make sure that
they send representatives who have authority to approve any agreements
reached during the negotiations. Wagner can extend the conference if
necessary.
The purpose of the conference is to settle past accounts and structure
"new arrangements for California's energy future," Wagner said in a
scheduling order. To reach those goals, the parties must agree on how much of
the electricity load will be shifted away from the volatile spot market for
immediate delivery into stable, long-term contracts, refunds and
"credit-worthiness matters," the order said.
Edison General Counsel Stephen E. Pickett said the utility is pleased
that regulators set up the meeting with power generators to discuss refunds
to the utilities dating back to Oct. 2.
"Certainly, it is a positive step toward resolving many of these
issues," Pickett said in a conference call Tuesday with creditors.
San Diego Gas & Electric expressed similar muted optimism.
"SDG&E has been a supporter of customer refunds, and we're encouraged
that the FERC is working toward a settlement," SDG&E spokesman Art Larson
said.
But Reliant Energy spokeswoman Pat Hammond expressed skepticism about
the $9-billion overcharge figure cited by Davis. "That number sounds like the
price of all the power they've bought in the last year in California, and we
obviously don't feel that is owed" by Reliant and other power producers.
Donato Eassey, a Houston-based energy analyst for Merrill Lynch, said he
expects the FERC-mediated conference to produce a compromise in which all
parties--generators, utilities and consumers--get "a haircut." But that
outcome, he suggested, might beat the alternatives.
"You've got to put this problem behind you," he said, "because if you
don't, you'll have a problem of biblical proportions."

FERC Members Also Before Senate Panel
Adding to the pressure for refunds, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
introduced a bill Wednesday that would require FERC to order rebates if
federal regulators determine that prices charged were "unjust and
unreasonable."
The five members of FERC's governing board also appeared Wednesday
before the Senate panel but were scheduled later in the day to avoid a public
confrontation with Davis.
The governor met privately Wednesday with two new board members,
including Patrick H. Wood III, a Bush ally from Texas who, according to
Davis, has indicated a "more aggressive approach to refunds might be in
order."
Still, there was no shortage of partisanship at the committee hearing.
Republican aides passed out hand-held fans bearing the inscription:
"Gray Davis' solution for summer blackouts." Davis handed out a slick
177-page book detailing steps his administration has taken to ease the power
crunch. The Bush administration issued a Department of Energy study asserting
that California would face twice as many rolling blackouts if hard price caps
were imposed on wholesale electricity.
Davis did not escape a scolding from Republican senators for his
criticism of the Bush administration's refusal to impose firm price controls.
Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) pointedly asked Davis "how he let things
get totally out of hand" and excoriated the governor for assigning blame for
the state's problems to the Bush administration, federal regulators, former
Gov. Pete Wilson and various "corporate pirates." He also faulted Davis for
not acting sooner to pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers.
"If I passed on a 700% increase to the citizens of California, there
would be an outrage the likes of which you have never seen," Davis responded.
Republican senators also challenged Davis on how he hopes to stimulate
more power plant construction in California if state officials continue to
attack generating companies. They noted that the state attorney general even
suggested that the chairman of one power company deserved to be locked in a
cell with an amorous inmate named Spike.
"This is a rough business," Davis responded. "The people I represent are
mad."
He also told his Republican critics: "If you were in my shoes and facing
the extraordinary price increases, you would feel as I do. Our first
obligation is to fight back."
Davis urged the committee to keep pressure on FERC to rein in natural
gas prices, which until recently have been as much as eight times higher than
the national average.
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. assured the committee that his agency
is aggressively pursuing remedies to California's energy price spikes and
supply shortages. "We have been engaged," he said, citing more than 60 orders
issued by the agency to address the power crisis.
Commissioner William L. Massey, a Democrat who has urged stronger
federal intervention in the electricity markets, said he regrets the
commission did not act sooner.
"Businesses have closed down, putting thousands out of work and hurting
the Western economy, and all because of a broken electricity market," he
said. "By acting 10 months ago, we could have prevented much of the economic
carnage."
Despite the tensions, Davis elicited some sympathy from even his
Republican critics.
"I wouldn't wish your problems on my worst enemy," Thompson told Davis.

House Approves Utility Aid for Needy
Congress: Bill would add $300 million to program that helps families pay
their bills. Strict price caps are blocked.

By JANET HOOK, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON--In its first direct legislative response to the nation's
burgeoning energy crisis, the House on Wednesday approved legislation that
would provide an additional $300 million to help low-income families pay
their power bills.
The bill amounts to a midyear increase of 21% for the $1.4-billion
energy assistance program--twice as much as President Bush had proposed
adding to help the poor cope with increases in utility bills.
Before final action on the bill, House Republican leaders blocked
Democratic efforts to force votes on a broader response to the energy crisis
in the West: strict energy price caps that reach beyond the restraints
imposed Monday by federal regulators.
Republicans argued that price caps would not solve California's energy
problem, while Democrats accused the GOP of being cavalier about the crisis
faced by consumers.
"This says to the people of the West, 'Your emergency doesn't count to
us,' " said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).
But such assertions were countered by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas), who said: "Members should reject the siren song of price caps and
remember this: Government price controls will mean more blackouts."
The issue erupted during debate on a $6.5-billion midyear appropriation
bill to cover unanticipated costs and emergency expenditures, including $5.5
billion for the Defense Department and $116 million to help the Internal
Revenue Service pay the cost of sending out rebate checks authorized by the
recently enacted tax cut law.
The measure passed, 341 to 87.
In an earlier vote, Bush barely escaped an embarrassing slap when
Democrats moved to cut the proposed IRS increase by $29 million--the cost of
a letter the agency is sending to tell taxpayer of their impending tax rebate.
Democrats complained that the letter, which prominently mentions Bush,
reads like a piece of campaign literature. Republicans said it was needed to
save people from calling the IRS about their checks. The amendment failed,
216 to 212.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where Democrats are considering an even
bigger increase in energy aid for the poor.
Overall, the House bill would provide the $6.5 billion requested by
Bush. But it would change some spending priorities. For instance, Bush's
Office of Management and Budget objects strongly to provisions that would
rescind $389 million in money appropriated for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency--just as the disaster relief agency is facing big outlays
to cope with damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison.
That provision to rescind the money came under attack from Democrats and
Republicans, posing the debate's most serious challenge to the bill. But an
effort to send the bill back to the Appropriations Committee and restore the
money was defeated on a party line vote of 218 to 209.
The energy aid for the poor is provided through the Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Program, which helps the poor and elderly pay heating and
air-conditioning bills. In California, a family of four must earn less than
$33,125 to be eligible, and the average benefit is $326 a year.
Although Republicans and Democrats have been divided over broad
questions of energy policy, there has been a bipartisan consensus on more
help for needy consumers. So, despite pressure to hold down the cost of the
supplemental spending bill, House Republicans doubled Bush's request for $150
billion in additional energy aid. GOP leaders blocked, on procedural
technicalities, Democratic amendments to increase the funding even more.
Republican leaders also fought efforts by Democrats to turn debate on
the spending bill into Congress' first broad-gauged discussion on the
nation's energy crisis. Democrats wanted to offer major energy amendments,
including one to impose strict cost-based price caps on wholesale electricity
in California--stricter price restraints than the policy announced Monday by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Proponents of the stricter caps, echoing complaints by California Gov.
Gray Davis and others, said FERC's order did not go far enough to guarantee
relief for consumers against blackouts, shortages and price gouging.
Republicans argued that price caps would be counterproductive and that
California's problems will be solved only by increasing the energy supply.
Democrats lost a 222-205 procedural vote that blocked their amendments
from coming to a vote.It was an important victory for Republican leaders who
had feared mounting support for price caps even within their own party.
However, momentum flagged this week after the FERC decision.
The House bill also includes:
* $45 million for a Defense Department plan to make military bases in
California self-sufficient and get them off the state's power grid during
shortages.
* $1.5 million for planning and environmental studies for a proposed
upgrade in an electrical transmission line in Central California known as
Path 15.




Summer Starts, Power Doesn't Stop
Energy: Consumers show they can take the heat, with their conservation
helping to limit demand. But experts remain wary.

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer

As unwelcome as the killer bees, as hyped as "Pearl Harbor," the big,
bad summer of 2001 officially arrived today and--did someone forget to turn
out the lights?
After months of dread, the Blackout Summer began on a curiously bright
note. Despite several days of summer-like weather, there was barely a whisper
about blackouts. The state that couldn't plug in a night light in January
without tripping electrical shortage alarms managed to enter the summer with
electricity to spare.
For the moment, power supplies look healthy. Wholesale electricity
prices are a sliver of what they were just a month ago. Demand for power is
down, apparently the result of a successful conservation campaign. And
California officials appear to have won their months-long battle with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which imposed price and supply controls
on the Western electricity market beginning at midnight last night.
All in all, an auspicious beginning for what many have warned would be a
dreadful summer. So why aren't California energy officials blowing up
balloons for the big end-of-crisis party?
"We are not out of the woods," said Richard Sklar, the state's energy
supply czar. "We are not out of the woods on price, and we are not out of the
woods on availability."
His view is echoed by most of those who closely watch the state's
electrical market. So far, California's supply-demand balance is coming
closer to best-case predictions than to the worst. But it is a delicate
balance.
On Wednesday, with temperatures hovering around summer norms, operators
of the statewide power grid managed to maintain--if just barely--the 7% of
operating reserves they strive for. When reserves dip below that, the state
begins ascending the ladder of staged emergency declarations that eventually
lead to blackouts.
Total electricity use in the state peaked about 4 p.m. at 39,156
megawatts--a high for the year, but well below the state's all-time record of
45,884 megawatts, which was set on July 12, 1999.
State officials credit conservation with shaving off about 4,000
megawatts, an amount that easily means the difference between blackouts or no
blackouts on most days.
"There is no doubt in my mind that conservation . . . has led directly
to the situation that we're in now," said Mike Sloss, who tracks conservation
for the California Energy Commission.
Richard Roher, who crunches conservation numbers for the commission,
said consumers appear to be continuing to cut their electricity use by about
11%.
There also has been good news on the supply side of the equation. After
months in which power plant breakdowns and shutdowns were costing the state
as much as 15,000 megawatts of electricity at a time, most plants are now
online and outages were down to 4,300 megawatts Wednesday.
Most small, alternative energy suppliers finally reached agreement this
week in their epic contract battle with Southern California Edison, putting
that vital segment of the state's energy production back in business. And in
the next two weeks, the state's first two new major power plants in a decade
are scheduled to open, adding more than 1,000 megawatts to the power
stream--enough to serve about 750,000 typical homes.
State officials are also hoping that the FERC ruling, which limits
prices in the 11-state Western region and requires generators to sell
available power to California, will ease the situation further.
"Everyone is very interested to see how tomorrow unfolds, price-wise and
supply-wise," Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for California's grid
operator, said Wednesday.
For all the positive signs, no one is predicting that the state will
weather the summer without blackouts. No one knows how many power plants will
break down. Nor does anyone know the extent to which Californians' best
intentions to conserve will melt away in a sustained heat wave.
While the past few days have been hot, they haven't been searing. It was
81 in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, 94 in Riverside, 102 in Sacramento,
109 in Palm Springs--toasty, but far from the hottest weather any of those
places can expect this summer.
Nor was it unusually hot in surrounding states, whose ability to sell
power to California depends in part on their own energy needs. Electricity
use generally rises with the thermometer, because air conditioners use more
power than most other appliances.
"If it gets hot in California, and it's also hot in the Northwest . . .
and it's hot in Phoenix, we could run into some significant problems," said
Jan Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers
Assn., a trade group for power plant owners in California.
The state has benefited recently from imports of electricity from the
Northwest, where snow runoff is cascading through electrical turbines. But
those imports are expected to dry up later in the summer as stream flowswhich
have been kept high to assist salmon runs--are scaled back to levels that
reflect the region's winter drought.
So the summer of 2001 could still be interesting. And it may begin with
a blackout after all. For weeks now, an e-mail campaign has spread through
the Internet, calling on people to voluntarily cut off most or all of their
power between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. tonight.
The protest, called the "Roll Your Own Blackout," is the idea of a
Southern California artist who worked in tandem with a software engineer from
Berkeley. Their intention is to protest the energy policies recently
announced by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.
"When you hear Mr. Cheney, who drafted the energy plan, deriding
conservation as merely a personal virtue, it is as though he believes virtue
has no place in government policy, and that would be a very dangerous thing,"
said Dave Aragon, the software engineer.
The California crisis gave birth to their campaign, but Aragon said he
is hoping that the protest goes beyond the state's borders.
"Worldwide would be fine," he said.






Board Votes to Let State Tax Power Plants
Proposal: Levies on property currently are made by counties. The revenue
would increase, say proponents of change.

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--State tax collectors endorsed a proposal Wednesday that
could force power plant owners to pay tens of millions of dollars more in
taxes next year.
The five-member Board of Equalization voted unanimously to assert
jurisdiction over the property taxes paid by companies with power plants that
produce more than 50 megawatts. Under the board's proposal--which faces
public hearings before it takes effect--the state would seize from counties
the authority to tax these plants.
State control could potentially enrich government coffers, because the
state would tax the plants based on their fair market value, while counties
tax power plant owners based on the original value of the plants plus a 2%
annual inflation rate.
Consumer advocates argue that the value of private power plants has
skyrocketed in the past year, as the price of wholesale electricity soared in
the malfunctioning market created under California's 1998 deregulation plan.
Under deregulation, utilities sold 22 power plants to private companies,
many of them based out of state, for a total of $3.2 billion.
"They are making exorbitant profits," said Lenny Goldberg, executive
director of the California Tax Reform Assn., a nonprofit group largely funded
by unions. He called the power plants "vastly underassessed."
Board of Equalization Chairwoman and state Controller Kathleen Connell
said the move is necessary not only because it might bring in more tax
revenue, but because California itself could soon build power plants or own
power lines under plans pushed by Gov. Gray Davis.
"We may not be getting the best value through the current system," said
Connell, "especially if the state proceeds with plans to own plants in
California.
"It makes sense to act now to bring all generating facilities under the
same assessment system," she said.
For many decades, the Board of Equalization levied property taxes on
power plants because they were owned by utilities and regulated by the state.
But in 1999, after the launch of deregulation, the tax board voted to allow
counties to assess property taxes on power plants under a formula set by
Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that limits property taxes for
homeowners and businesses.
The board's vote Wednesday launches a process of public hearings that
could lead to a reversal of that 1999 decision.
Officials from several cities that are home to power plants urged the
Board of Equalization to take no action. Under the current system, cities
with power plants get a greater share of property tax revenue, which is
generally split among local governments and schools.
Long Beach got about $55,000 a year in property tax revenue when the
state was assessing taxes, said city Controller Barbara Hennessy, but now
gets nearly $1 million a year.
Shari L. Freidenrich, treasurer for Huntington Beach, said a reversal of
the board's tax method could cost the city--home to a major power plant--$1.5
million a year in property taxes.
A bill pending in the Legislature by Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San
Francisco) would protect those cities by guaranteeing that they get the same
proportion of property tax revenue even if the state reasserts control over
power plant assessments.
Goldberg, of the California Tax Reform Assn., argued that allowing the
state to tax plant owners based on market value would bring in more revenue
for the entire state.
As an example, he estimated that a big power plant on Monterey Bay owned
by Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy North America would have paid Monterey
County at least an additional $10 million in property taxes last year under
the proposed method of assessment. The plant, valued by the county at $362
million, is probably worth about $2 billion given market conditions, Goldberg
said.
The power industry argues that when California lifted state regulation
of power plants in 1998, those plants became businesses no different from a
department store or bakery in terms of property tax status.
"We would expect to be treated like any other business in California has
been treated since Prop. 13 went into place," said Duke spokesman Tom
Williams.



Davis' spinmeisters draw heat from watchdogs
State controller refuses to pay energy advisers

Gov. Gray Davis' decision to hire the "Masters of Disaster" -- two former
Clinton-Gore spin doctors -- has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group and a
refusal by the state controller to pay the two political strategists.
Since the energy crisis began, Davis has hired several nationally known
experts to advise him. But the recent contract for Chris Lehane and Mark
Fabiani has opened a political wound, in part because the two men are
considered fiercely partisan and politically ruthless.
State Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat who continually fights with
Davis, said yesterday that she will refuse to pay Lehane and Fabiani with
state funds. Their contract is worth $180,000 for six months.
Connell said it's hard for her to imagine that Lehane and Fabiani are working
on state policy, as required by law, and not politics.
"From my viewpoint, you're asking Californians to survive with fewer lights
on and you're asking them to assume the burden of $43 billion in long-term
debt for power," Connell said. "It's just another slap in the face to ask
them to pay for people to explain the situation away."
The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly
monitors legislation, filed a lawsuit last week alleging that Fabiani and
Lehane are violating the Political Reform Act because they also have done
work for Southern California Edison as consultants.
It's considered a conflict of interest for public officials to work on issues
that affect companies that pay them more than

Howdy.  The below was originally the (false) start of a short story, but
quickly metamorphisized into something close to autobiography.  Some of
the original atmospherics have lingered, and don't necessarily reflect
anything about yours truly.  Later.

At The Galata Tower Cafe

Cigarette smoke, ignoring the lazy sweep of an old ceiling fan, hangs in
the air above me.  It seems to mock my obsessive, rambling thoughts
about teaching and writing and learning Turkish and, of course, HER.
"Take it easy", it says with a smirk.  "Relax."  A phony look of concern
clouds it further.  "What about taking a deep breath?"  Surreptitiously
(I think), I take in the recommended breath, but the smoke has drifted
in closer, notices.  "There!  Isn't that better?"

"No", I say to myself.  (Don't worry, I am not so far gone as to take
this internal dialogue thing outside.)  I flick my hand through one
particularly annoying cloud of the stuff.  "Now get lost!"

Outside, at the base of the ancient Galata Tower, kids on their way home
from school set off an M-80.  I flinch at the explosion, which is
amplified by the tight dimensions of the square and the old stone walls
surrounding it.  The square itself, left in a premature dusk by the huge
tower's shadow, is temporarily emptied of the teenaged mob.  I stare out
the window into the gloom.  Though only the bottom few meters yards of
the tower are visible to me, I am aware of its tremendous bulk.  The
tower, first built by the Genoese in the 1300's, dominates my entire
neighborhood, the Kuledibi.  It should remind us all, I suppose, of the
durability of stone and dirt, and of the significantly less impressive
characteristics of flesh and blood.  Day and night (amused, perhaps, by
the slim activity of this generation's version of flesh and blood?), it
stands obdurate, unmoved, like the leg of a giant one dare not disturb.

Emboldened by the lack of any official response to the bombing,
one-by-one the would be terrorists (or freedom fighters; who's to say?)
drift back into the square.  I suspect the tower isn't nearly half as
bothered by these kid's budding pyromania as me, since it has no doubt
been subject to much more serious attacks during its 700 or so year
history.  Seeing that no adult has stormed into the square to
re-establish order, I brace myself for another blast.  Maybe I'm the
only one who really minds.  Every male in this country does have to
serve in the army for eighteen months.  Perhaps the noise doesn't bother
them, or maybe they see that this rather serious version of child's play
has a practical side to it, giving the kids a head start on basic
training.

I am surprised to discover that the waiter, Yusuf, is standing next to
me. He has his head thrown back slightly, a gesture that has become, for
my benefit, his version of the question "More tea?"  (He has given up on
words, as the ones he knows still don't much match the ones I know.)

"Evet, cay lutfen.  Bir az sutlu, lutfen. [Yes, tea please.  With a
little milk, please.]"  (Never would have guessed that, huh.  And yes, I
agree  [and have been told before] too many "lutfens".  There are
probably other mistakes too, but my words seem to get the job done.
I'll work on perfecting them, "sonra [later]".)

Yusuf nods, walks away.

I realize I have my head bent forward, a subconscious adjustment I must
have made to dodge some of the smoke.  I see a cat under one of the
tables looking up at me.  It opens its mouth for what I figure is the
beginning of a yawn.  But, instead, it emits a strange, high-pitched
wail, sounding more like a bird than a cat.  Embarrassed for the poor
thing, I look away.

For maybe the first time since I have been coming to this cafe, I take a
close look around.  (I must be getting more comfortable. "Dikkat! [Watch
out!]")  There are very few other people in the cafe, which is
surprising, given the amount of smoke.  They are all sitting alone,
their heads, like mine, bent forward.  I suspect that boredom, however
-- and not the smoke -- is the proximate cause.

Every table is covered with green felt table clothes, all of which are
seriously spotted with tea stains and cigarette burns.  In the middle of
each table, looking like a tiny shrunken crown, is a silver ashtray.

Above the kitchen, which is squeezed unnecessarily tight into a corner
of the otherwise spacious caf?, hangs a huge painting of a beach scene
from somewhere in the Pacific.  Once no doubt bright and evocative, it
has aged and has now almost completely blended into and disappeared
amongst the dull wood panels covering the top half of the room.  The
green of the palm trees lining the beach is now so dark it is
approaching black.  The sand, probably once pure white, is the color of
the mud in the streets outside and the sea close to the color of the tea
served here. There are several boats pictured, all pulled up onto the
sand, but they are now no more than ghosts and, indeed, look as if
someone may have tried to erase them.  The painting is as changed and
distorted as the dreams of those who sit below it absent-mindedly
stirring their tea, their feet crammed into shoes stiff from having
walked through too much winter rain, their fingernails having long ago
surrendered to the dirt now permanently built up under them, wearing
clothes that didn't smell so bad this morning they couldn't be worn just
one more day, drinking the cheap tea they can scarcely afford, dreaming
perhaps of little more than an early spring.

I sit up in my chair, let my head fall back, take in a deep breath and,
surprisingly, begin to relax.

Greg - Mark is correct that Terry no longer controls these budgets, this is a
carry-over from last year that we'll need to get corrected.  The majority of
the difference between the allocations for 2000 and 2001 is for the
Environmental Health & Safety group under Mike Terraso.  Mike is out of the
office this week, but I'll follow up with his direct reports to get a
description of the allocation for each of their cost centers.

As the Project Finance allocation is flat from year to year, I'm guessing
that it isn't the issue you're most concerned about.  Please let me know if
this is not the case.

I'll be forwarding more information to you shortly, as I receive it.

Please ignore the previous memo.  I had a wrong date in it.  Thanks. Lynn
The following is the procedure Gas Logistics and Marketing have agreed to beginning this weekend to
segregate the TW and NNG morning meeting.
1.  TW will have their morning meeting in EB1336 Mondy through Friday at 8:00 a.m. beginning, Monday, January 21, 2002. TW schedulers will attend this meeting.
2.  Gas Logistics will be sure either Steve January, Darrell Schoolcraft or Gary Spraggins is in attendance for Gas Control and either Lynn Blair, Terry Kowalke or John Buchanan is in attendance for scheduling discussions.
3.  On Fridays at 3:00 p.m., beginning Friday, January 18 , 2002, there will be a meeting in EB1336 to review any TW issues for the weekend.  Marketing and Gas Logistics will be in attendance.
4.  Beginning this weekend, Saturday, January 12, 2002,  on Saturday and Sunday, if there are any TW issues that need to be discuss, Gas Logistics will call the appropriate Marketing On Call person after the NNG 8:00 morning meeting.
5.  NNG will continue to have their Marketing/Gas Logistics morning meeting in EB42C2 Monday through Friday and the Conference call at 8:00 a.m. on Satruday and Sunday.
6.  The TW Schedulers will attend the meeting at EB1336 Monday through Friday.  On Saturday and Sunday, they will be in the NNG morning meeting conference call and stay on the line for the TW meeting if it is necessary to have one.  We are continuing to include the TW schedulers on the conference call due to discussions about system issues which impact both pipelines.
If anyone has any questions, or would like to discuss any changes, please let Kim Watson or I know and we can certainly look at other options.
I apologize this did not get started this last Friday, but I believe everyone has it on their calendars now.
Thanks for everyones help and support to come up with a solution that hopefully works for all.

Subject: FWD: Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

How true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Warning: Beer Contains Female Hormones

Yesterday, scientists for Health Canada suggested that
men should take a look at their beer consumption,
considering the results of a recent analysis that
revealed the presence of female hormones in beer. The
theory is that drinking beer makes men turn into
women.

To test the finding, 100 men were fed 6 pints of beer
each.  It was then observed that 100% of the men
gained weight, talked excessively without making
sense, became overly emotional, couldn't drive, failed
to think rationally, argued over nothing,
and refused to apologize when wrong.

No further testing is planned.

Attached is the latest draft of the Transport Option Program filing.  After
our discussion last week I made a couple of significant changes from the last
draft.

One is that we're no longer stating that the option fee is going to be
"market-based."   Instead I have tried to portray the option fee as a
built-in feature of the transport rate, which is simply being disaggregated
into a separate option fee.

The other significant change is that I've structured the tariff language and
the agreement so that every shipper, regardless of whether they currently use
transport on TW, will have to have a firm transportation agreement when they
buy an option.  In other words, a shipper that does not currently have a
service agreement will simply execute an agreement with a MAXDTQ of zero.  If
you don't think I've explained this clearly enough, let me know.

I'm meeting informally with the Commercial Group next week to discuss 1) some
examples of options to make sure the tariff provisions and contract work from
a logistical standpoint, 2) the bidding process, and how bids for options
will be evaluated, and 3) further comments received from shippers.  I'll
circulate our ideas on bidding and awarding options, and any other new ideas
or questions.

As I've discussed with some of you, our shippers are asking to see the filing
in its entirety before we file it, and would like to have a roundtable
meeting prior to filing to discuss their concerns.  I realize there is some
concern about showing them our filing.  What if we just show them our final
tariff language and form agreement, and offer to host a meeting to discuss
their questions?  Let me know what you think.

Our target filing date will depend on whether we have a customer meeting
first, and when FERC staff is available to talk.

Dick;
New Power has an issue with ENA on the TCO capacity that is released to us
each month by CPA.  I need to put this in an e-mail in order to get others
included in the topic.

During the purchase of the CES Retail business, we asked for a summary of all
capacity from CES.  CES could not produce contracts because ENA, as their
agent, possessed all pipeline contracts.  CES requested a summary of the
capacity applicable to Retail.  ENA, in response to the request, produced a
document representing the receipt and delivery points applicable to the
pipeline capacity.  The capacity allocated from CPA was clearly represented
as 100% Leach receipt point.  Corresponding, New Power has established all of
its curves based on this assumption.  We have now determined, as a result of
a pipeline cut, that we actually have Broadrun and AGG 6 receipt point
capacity.

Not only was the receipt point misrepresented on the summary that was
ultimately incorporated into the CES Purchase Agreement as a schedule, ENA
also recently executed new TCO capacity on our behalf from CPA and failed to
provide any notice to us that the allocations changed on receipt point
capacity giving us a much greater % of AGG 6 capacity.

This is a difficult situation.   We are significantly hurt from an economic
standpoint as a result.  The Agg 6 gas is as good as worthless since I can
not find gas here for winter.  It will probably be stranded.  This means I
have to find delivered gas for the majority of supply which trades at
exorbitant price.  I also have to pay premiums for Broadrun capacity.  I need
to get a reply from you as to what options ENA sees in addressing this
situation.  As our supply manager, we are looking to you for a economic make
whole.

response_text:
The following two tables are excerpted out of WP-02-E-BPA-77, page 9, lines
4-26.


Table Illustrating JCG Method










Table Illustrating BPA Method













Before beginning the comparison of the two tables, it should be pointed out
that the tables calculate gross augmentation costs.  We left out the step
that calculates the net augmentation costs.  As a result, the &Total8 line
dollar amounts ($6M and $6.2M in the JCG table, and $6M and $6M in the BPA
table) should all be reduced by the amount of augmentation resale revenue.
However, since this modification will not affect the comparison requested in
the data request, let us continue as if the &Total8 line dollar amounts are
already net of the augmentation revenue. See the attachment to the data
response.



















Another item that may be confusing is the item labeled &Pre-purchase ) 0 day
rule8.  This is the incremental cost associated with purchases made between
the 120-day cut-off and the 0-day cut-off.

Also, a crosswalk of each table showing how it corresponds to a variable or
equation in section f is not possible since section f reflects the BPA
method, not the JCG method.  Perhaps an overview of BPA,s perspective on the
difference between the JCG method and the BPA method will be helpful.

JCG calculated the augmentation costs using two different cost pools, one
cost pool for the Slice product (using the 120 day rule), and a second cost
pool for all other products (using the 0 day rule).  The products then
collected a portion of the augmentation costs associated with a specific
rule.  When these two cost pools yield different net augmentation costs
(which they usually will unless all of the augmentation is purchased under
the 120-day rule), the JCG method doesn,t collect the actual amount of either
of those pools from Slice or non-Slice.  Rather it collects a proportion of
each of the cost pools.

In contrast to the JCG method, the BPA method distributes the costs using the
120-day rule proportionally between the Slice and non-Slice products, and
then assesses all the incremental cost from using the 0-day rule rather than
the 120-day rule to the non-Slice products.  In contrast to JCG method, this
assures that all the actual incremental net augmentation costs calculated by
replacing the &120-day8 rule with the &0-day8 rule are recovered  from
purchasers of non-Slice power products.  In addition, this also assures that
purchasers of the Slice product do not bear any nearer term market prices
fluctuations.

Now for a short description of each line in the two tables, and a comparison
of the differences.  The example assumes that we don,t actually purchase all
of our augmentation, that some of it is served from BPA,s secondary, or is
bought in the spot market.

&Pre-purchase ) 120 day rule8 is the total cost of augmentation purchases
made at least 120 days prior to the month of delivery.  This amount is $2M in
both tables in both columns.  This amount represents the sum of DIURNALACA
for the six-month period.  This would have represented DIURNALACA(S) in the
GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case.

&Pre-purchase ) 0 day rule8 is the additional cost of pre-purchases made less
than 120 days prior to the month of delivery.  This amount is $1M in both
tables in the non-Slice column.  The 0-day rule pre-purchases are not
applicable to the Slice product, thus the N/A in the Slice column in both
tables.  If &Pre-purchase ) 120 day rule8 and &Pre-purchase ) 0 day rule8
were summed the sum would represent DIURNALACA(NS) in the GRSPs proposed by
the customers.  Note that the Pre-purchase ) 0 day rule appears in a
different row in the BPA table since BPA has proposed that these incremental
cost enter the calculations at a different point.

Short position is the cost of the amount of AAMTA that is not pre-purchased.
This is the amount that is valued at PRICE in the GRSPs.  In the JCG, the
short position is different between the Slice and non-Slice columns.  This is
because the example has BPA purchasing some additional augmentation ($1M
worth) under the 0-day rule, and there is a corresponding reduction in the
value of BPA,s short position.  The change also reflects that the short
position is valued using different PRICEs for the 120 day rule and the 0 day
rule.  In the BPA example, Short position is $3M for both Slice and non-Slice
products, and the difference (-$0.8M) is found in the row &Short position 0
day rule8

&Buydown8 is the cost of all buydowns.  It is the same in both tables, for
both Slice and non-Slice products.  In the examples BPA spent $1M buying down
load.

&Total8 is the gross cost of augmentation.  As stated above, it should be
reduced by the augmentation resale revenue.  To continue on, let us assume
that &Total8 has been reduced by augmentation resale revenue, and represents
the net augmentation costs.  In the JCG  example, &Total8 is $6M for Slice
and $6.2M for non-Slice.  These would represent NACA(S) and NACA(NS) in the
GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case..  In the BPA example, Total
is $6M for both Slice and non-Slice.  This represents NACA in the BPA GRSPs.

&Percent of CRACable revenue8 is the same in both tables.  The example shows
that the Slice revenue is 30% of the total CRACable revenue, and the
non-Slice revenue is 70% of the total CRACable revenue.

&LB CRAC Costs8 only appears in the BPA example.  It is the NACA distributed
between Slice and non-Slice products in proportion to actual revenue.

&Pre-purchase 0 day rule8 and &Short position 0 day rule8 are the changes in
the valuation of pre-purchases ($1M) and Short position (-$0.8M) between the
120 day rule and the 0 day rule.  The net difference of $0.2M is equivalent
to the difference that is seen in &Total8 in the JCG example (the difference
between $6M and $6.2M).  This difference is also equivalent to NACDIFF in the
BPA GRSPs.

&Total LB CRAC Cost(s)8 is the cost that the Slice and non-Slice groups true
up to.  In the JCG example, the Slice product trues up to 30% of $6M, or
$1.8M while the non-Slice products true up to 70% of $6.2M for a total from
both groups of $6.14M.  In BPA,s example, the Slice product pays 30% of $6M
or $1.8M (the same as in the JCG example) while the non-Slice products pay
70% of $6M plus the net difference between valuation of net augmentation
costs using the 120 day rule and valuation using the 0 day rule.  The
non-Slice amount is $4.2M plus $0.2M or $4.4M.

Guys--

First of all, Louise, I understand we have a baby??  CONGRATULATIONS!! (details please, at your earliest chance)

Regarding the Wharton e-Business Initiative (see below for one of the many eMails I've received concerning Enron's participation--link to the referenced web site for specific agenda; also, I've received several voice messages from leaders of the effort).  The information below discusses one of the  forums (coming up 5/31-6/1) that comprise an on-going e-business initiative in which Enron has invested with Wharton.

The participants from Wharton include senior level professors; while there may be some student involvement, the intentional focus is high level discussion and research endeavors at the professorial level.
Other participants in WeBI are Corporate representatives.  The idea is for the professors to offer their latest research issues, promote discussions among the corporate participants to talk through the professors research and other research in the literature, as well as for the professors to listen for new areas for which commercial eBusinesses are seeking new research.

Again,  this is intentionally designed as a High Level Professor participation on the Wharton side, and high level e-Business Corporate executives on the other side. This is intentionally designed to create a high-level 'e-think-tank' environment for senior level professors and corporate executives.

O.K.....have I labored enough to describe what WeBI is all about??

As opposed to the several other efforts Enron University Affairs has to DIRECTLY increase Enron's favorability and familiarity on campus at levels above recruiting, but that ultimately trickle down to recruiting, this is intentionally a research/discussion effort. Clearly, the Enron Brand equity in dealing with professors is that the professors ultimately incorporate work from information from the participatory forums into their class teachings, references, course work, etc.

A few weeks ago, Louise and I breifly chatted about Enron's involvement in this effort.  Clearly, there is a HUGE interest by the Wharton professors and other corporate participants involved to have Enron attend and participate---they quite respectfully call me and eMail me very frequently.......All of this is very interesting to me and I have shepherded our minimal involvement-in-fact........ yet the question remains:  is there someone at Enron, directly involved in Enron's eBusiness initiatives, interested in jumping into this effort and participating?  Do those of you involved in these businesses think it worth your time and expense, or the time and expense of one of your senior (at least Director level) people to participate?  Would it be viewed, at least at this time,  simply as an "Enron brain drain" (I've received this realistic and possibly quite legitimate concern from more than one business person at Enron).

The bottom line is, I'd like to be able to respond intelligently and honestly to those at Wharton committed to this effort.  I feel more than comfortable telling Wharton that, at this time, Enron is satisfied to participate in the WeBI effort largely at the
financial level it has already invested--with the option to participate at other levels in the future, at Enron's discretion.

ALL comments solicited----

Many thanks!!

--Christie.

I have spoken this morning with Tom Ganucheau, Calpine's lawyer, and
confirmed that the depositions of Calpine witnesses are on for next week.
Tom is juggling schedules with the witnesses, and I told him we'd accomodate
their schedules, but I wanted him to give me a batting order by this Friday,
April 20, which he said he could do.

The following people are scheduled to be deposed: Carey Jordan, Steve Snow,
Paul Posoli, and Darryl Hayslip. Mr. Jordan will double as the CPSC
corporate rep, and I told Tom I had no problem taking his deposition once
and agreeing that it covered both his individual notice and the corporate
rep notice. Tom is still working on who will be named as the Calpine Corp.
corporate rep, and will advise us.

It will be very helpful if either Elizabeth or Ed can be present for at
least part of these depositions, especially Snow and Jordan.  At a minimum,
please jot down (or reply email) your thoughts as to any points you want to
be sure we cover with these witnesses.  Cross examination of an adverse
witness in circumstances like this is much more effective when the Enron rep
knowledgable about the transaction is in the room, both to deter
exaggeration from the witness, and to serve as a resource for following up
on incorrect or evasive answers.

The summary judgment reply is due this Friday and will be filed on time. A
current draft was circulated yesterday evening to Bonnie and to Andy, along
with the current draft affidavits for Sager, Baughman, Bradford and Vollmar.
Sager's affidavit is signed and has been returned to me. Baughman called
yesterday with revisions and Bradford called this morning; we are still
waiting on the damage information to fill in the last paragraph of
Baughman's affidavit.

Please let me know if any of you need current copies of the brief or any
affidavits, and please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or
comments.

Best regards,

Bill Ogden

ENW EBS IT -  Weekly Status Report  (as of 10/26/01)


Executive Summary :

EnFiber:   Real Estate Book requirements gathering and documentation is 100% complete; obtained all approvals; development is 25% complete.  User acceptance testing for Scheduling Phase 1 is 85% complete; the implementation date has been changed to 10/26 per user's request.  Waiting for final signoff from Jim Terrell. Successfully implemented FACT Release 1.2 on 10/15.  Completed development of IP and Local Loop options for Valuation and began QA testing.

PPCS/TRPS:
TRP demo by Dorado is well accepted by Enron audience. The prototype is able to fix the biggest problem in the current EBS bandwidth trading process -- not able to show the actual hardware inventory of network elements in order to make accurate port striping and cross connect. Through their auto hardware discovery device driver, switch inventory will be presented clearly to the users in a nice graphical layout, so provisioners don't have to spend huge amount of time to maintain various IT systems to gather the knowledge of bandwidth capacity allocation.  TRPS will gather information for both TDM and IP.
Settlements (Saber):  Users are approximately 50% complete with User Acceptance Testing.  Users were successful in posting first invoices to SAP with no errors.  A demo of the GUI for the Flash to Actuals reconciliation process is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 29.  Production Implementation will be mid-to-late November,  a couple weeks ahead of original schedule.
Remedy:  Started discussions for release 2.0 of the EBS Change Management application.   Changes to include schedule maintenance notices and test & turnup.  These changes does not require mandatory approval. Added automatic reporting functionality to the EBS Trouble Ticketing system.  Continued web development on the MSN document routing and approval system.   Functionalities completed include submitting new request, approvals and comments.
Livelink thespotlight: is currently providing storage for 24606 documents. Currently work is in progress to incorporate Engineering and Operations documents into the system, as well as migrate the system into the Corp domain. Below is a more detailed description of this week's activities and next week's deliverables.
EBS Application Infrastructure:  Provide oversight and project management activities of the EBS application infrastructure with ENW.

EBS Database Technologies:   Provide on-going production and development database support for both external and internal EBS database systems.

Utopia: The proof of concept was completed Sept. 21st. A demo has now been given to Rick Paiste, Inja Chun, Rick Fehl, Paul Racicot and Sue Klinke, all reactions were favorable. The next steps will be to refine the presentation and re-present to upper management for further approval. Al Nahas will be demoed the product next week. We have identified issues with several of the dBs and this would require additional work to correct these data problems between the systems, this will not be an insignificant task.

Voice Minutes Trading:  USTeleNet has agreed to accept Enron routing data via an automated exchange (XML format) as opposed to the current labor-intensive process..  This will require USTeleNet to develop an interface to their TMS system.  We are also working with Nortel to interface with their Nortel switch via software (i.e. API).  Nortel has a proprietary DMS 250/300 operating system which requires manual input every time a route is changed;  we will continue to investigate the feasibility of interfacing internally-developed software to improve efficiencies & accuracies.  Many suppliers' rates have been downloaded to our environment for purpose of finding least-cost supplier's rates for our traders and creation of rate sheets for confirmation.  New Product Management and Supplier Rate Management modules have been developed and are now being tested by users.  Trader Ratesheet development should be completed & available for testing within the week.     We have scheduled 11/8 & 11/9 for the 4tel / Telesciences software demo.
Deal Prospects / Contact Tracking:  Reviewed options including existing solutions such as EnGAGE, Siebel (off-the-shelf) and an internally developed web-based tool.  Goal is to provide a simple, cost-effective tool that can be used by commercial teams (starting with Mid-Market, DRAM, Minutes ) to track prospects & contacts.
Enron  kicked off an enterprise-wide CRM initiative with the goal of recommending a CRM strategy (including Sales Force Automation) to senior Enron management by October 25.   EBS will only be participating in the assessment / evaluation stage.
Media Services / Strata:  Developed a Tactical Deal Capture product ; in process of completing Sales Invoice functionality for Tactical Settlements, including the ability to generate Sales Invoices on the basis of Physical Spots, Survey-Based GRPs, Overnight-Based GRPs, or PreBill (prior to actual spot airing).  Tactical Deal + Settlements are integrated, using Strata core data coupled with Tactical Deal data.   Continued systematic daily processing of Nielsen Overnight TV & Cable Ratings data (nearly 100,000 lines/day), along with systematic aggregation of Quarter Hour data for each TV program.   Created Buy Statistics & Market Statistics UI against existing Strata data.
EBS Contracts (tactical): Continued development of v5.2.  This release includes enhancements to add attributes for Minutes contracts.  The scheduled release date is 11/06.
EBS Contracts (strategic): Completed updating project plans and will provide to business next week.  Completed database modeling for tasks and reminders.  Began development of client-side (browser) validation for commercial contracts.
EBS Facilities:  Continued development of v3.3.  This release will include the ability to query key systems for their dependency on Facilities and automation of the short description.
Global Counterparty/Common Codes:  Corrected problems with wire information and address roles that were identified during Saber/Globals testing.

Project Name: PPCS/TRPS

Accomplishment - this week
Implement a new project plan to expedite the development effort of removing Xconnect from PPCS.
Connectivity between Pleasanton switch lab and Enron Ardmore/Greenspoint is rebuilt. Lucent 2.5 G test switch now is reachable for acceptance test.
Identify a Lucent 10 G test switch in Portland for acceptance test.
Identify a Lucent 4608 switch can be used for acceptance test. Since the switch is also in production. Extreme caution will be measured for port assignment. Additional coordination with Global Network Management group is required..
Dorado provides TRP prototype demo for provisioning, capacity management, TOC, NOC, GNM and IT. The demo goes very well and receives high remarks from attendants.
Furnish additional requirement to Dorado for TRP development.
All switches are reachable from PPCS in the whole week.
Test contracts running on Portland lab do not collect PM successfully. Investigation is under way. (Eric Liu)
Implement a code check in/out process in a joint development environment without direct network connectivity

Deliverables Scheduled for next week
Finish development to remove xconnect and disconnect from PPCS.
Coordinate with network engineering, network security, provisioning groups and NOC to determine when PPCS network security setting will be upgraded again.
Prepare db migration and production freeze.
Enron continues to furnish up to date business requirement of PPCS replacement product to Dorado.
Coordinate with GNM to identify available port assignment in the San Jose production switch for acceptant test.
Dorado deliver Red Cell API documents to Enron.

Key Date
Dorado delivers TRP prototype 1.0 date is 10-31-2001
Ardmore server goes into production date is 11-19-2001

Issue
Need to work with GNM to reset network security for PPCS before 1.1.2 goes into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to make sure current PPCS 1.0 contract will not send out disconnect commands after the network security setting is upgraded and before 1.1.2 goes into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to implement and communicate the new operation procedure to filed engineer and provisioning. So physical cross connect from SNMS will occur before PPCS PM collection time and physical disconnect from SNMS will occur after PPCS stops collecting PM. (David Workman)
Follow up with Terry Hoop's to find out whether the Luent 2.5 G test switch will be available in Shepherd. (Eric Liu)
Dorado needs to provide a complete set of final source code of PPCS 1.1.2 to Enron. (Dorado)
PPCS access level has been downgraded to prevent cross and disconnect commands sent to the switches. Because of the change, PPCS stop collecting PM data for newly entered contracts 'cause PM initialization requires the same level of access right as cross & disconnect. So security level for PPCS needs to be upgraded before George Babaz's team can continue to enter missing contracts to the system. But the timing is very tricky otherwise there maybe a possibility some existing contracts on version 1.0 will be terminated by PPCS. (Eric Liu)
Dorado needs to start deliver TRP related documents to Enron. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to package PPCS 1.1.2 delivery CDs with all the fix. (Dorado)
Installation documents from Dorado needs to be further flushed out. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to produce timeline and cost estimate for new requirement. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to provide TRP architecture. (Dorado)
Sylvix manager installation (Dorado and Rick Paiste)
Hardware support for outages needs to defined (David Wicks)
Final versions of 1.1.2 documents need to be updated in spotlight document management system (Eric Liu)

Project Name: Utopia

Accomplishment - DB
ECOMS has completed their view in Development and Production. Nothing more is needed of them at this time.
ENFIBER has completed their view in Development and Production. Nothing more is needed of them at this time.
IP ALLOC - A flat file is taken from Dennis Boylan (contains IP address ECOMS number) and put the data into an Oracle table in Utopia... The data will be static, but should be sufficient for the proof of concept.
DEAL LAUNCH has now received their required for supplying the SLA information that is required for the central dB
PPCS has to wait for the completion of their Oracle conversion top be able to supply their view in Development, this will be available sometime next week.
IPN PROD some analysis still needs to be done to get the IPN PROD details into the UTOPIA schema
FACILITIES has completed their view in Development (but it pulls in data from Production). Nothing more is needed of them at this time
dB has now been created and tested on robin.enron.com

Accomplishment - Application
Firewall - The PO has been received by the vendor. The Greenspoint units should arrive at Enron by 09/20.
Impact - The application has been configured on server jfkdev.
Omnibus - The application has been configured on server jfkdev.
Webtop - The application has been configured on server jfkdev.
Clients - The client software has been loaded on all developer PCs.

Deliverables Scheduled
Continue to work with security and network engineering groups to finalize firewall diagram.
Create examples to showcase what Utopia can accomplish.

Key Dates
Southern View consultants come to Enron to set up impact servers and train developers: 9-17-01 to 9-21-01
Present POC to EBS management 9-24-01 to 9-30-01.
Install Greenspoint firewall for IPsec tunnel 10-15-01

Issue
Network security - The possibility of an IPsec tunnel between the Greenspoint POP and the Ardmore DMZ has been revived. The tunnel is now dependant upon Mark Thibodeaux's approval of a revised EBS Change Management procedure. Ernest Hernandez is working to get the new CM process approved.
SLA data will not be available in EnFiber. We will get any data that we can from Deal Launch (Nick Patel). Any remaining data will be added to the Oracle tables by hand.
The Utopia developers have identified several bugs in the Impact v2.2 software. The bug list will be sent to Micromuse for immediate attention.

I attach a summary of the 11 outstanding ECC transactions under ECC's GTC:



In summary, the principal risks are:

Principal Risks:

1. Unexecuted Confirmation Letters on approx. 75,000 GJs per day
2. Receivables (approx. US $25MM pre-petition and approx. US $300K per day
post-petition)
3. MTM (aggregate negative MTM approx. US $1.9MM)

Please note:

1. I am trying to track down PG&E's back-up paper sent for each deal and will
update the chart to indicate the differences to their GTCs.  We have found
only one corresponding PG&E Confirmation Letter (for TAGG #N13588.1/2/3)
which refers to PG&E's form of unexecuted Master Agreement.  I have
summarized at the end of the chart the applicable provisions of PG&E's Master
Agreement form if it were to govern.

2. I have not been successful in tracking down Canadian insolvency counsel
over the weekend, but will keep trying.

Thought you might be interested in this survey.














Did you know that more Monopoly money is printed in a year than real money
printed throughout the world? Did you also know that we would greatly
appreciate your participation in our survey (see below)?






This report is available in PDF format (55.4k) at
http://www.gotoanalysts.com/piperpublic/goto/assets/pdfs/b2b/b2b12oct01.pdf



II. Survey Says







Thanks again to everyone that took the time to respond to our survey. We
will conduct similar surveys in the future in order to keep our fingers
ever closer to the pulse of e-business activity. We greatly appreciate your
input.


This survey's results were interesting, and provided us with quite a bit of
insight. At the same time, the responses to many questions were
conflicting, reflecting the current state of uncertainty within the sector
and the overall economy. The survey's participants came from a wide variety
of professions, though more than 50% came from consulting firms and
software companies. Please find an overview of the responses we received
for each of the questions, grouped by category, along with commentary
below.


Recovery?
Have we reached a "bottom" in terms of the decline of corporate spending on
e-business initiatives? Unsurprisingly, there was wide disagreement on this
topic, with 45% of respondents replying "probably," yet 43% countering with
"probably not."


45% Probably
43% Probably not
4% Definitely not
8% Not even close


When will we see a meaningful uptick in corporate spending on e-business
initiatives? There was also disagreement on this topic, though 90% expect
an uptick at some point during 2002. True bulls (the 8% who answered
"Q401") and true bears (the 2% that selected "2003 or later") were few in
number.


8% Q4 2001
47% Early 2002
43% Late 2002
2% 2003 or later


In our view, we may have reached a bottom during the September quarter, as
this quarter is seasonally weak in any year, and this year witnessed one of
the most challenging and paralyzing times that the United States has
encountered in years. However, we do not necessarily expect to see a
significant uptick during the next few quarters, as we expect the economy
and corporate earnings (which ultimately drive capital expenditure and IT
budgets) to weaken further during that time. The key question is when
corporate executives will sense a stabilization in their businesses, and
thus begin to feel more confident about investing.


IT Spending Priorities And Architecture
Please rank the following application categories, in terms of strategic
importance to the organization and likelihood of receiving IT budget
approval over the next 12 months. Of the categories available for
selection, supply-chain management ranked No. 1, closely followed by
customer relations management (CRM), e-procurement, and application
integration. Human capital management, product life cycle management, and
application server software were at the bottom of the list.


1 Supply-chain management
2 CRM
3 e-Procurement
4 Application integration
5 BI/Analytics
6 ERP
7 Application server software
8 Product life cycle management
9 Human capital management


How important a consideration is 100% Internet architecture when evaluating
e-business software products? The soft economy does not appear to have
tempered enthusiasm for new technology, as 45% answered "critical," with
another 45% responding "somewhat important." This was summed up by one
participant, who wrote, "the traditional software model is dead; the
importance of pure, Web-native architecture is critical to unleashing the
full potential of interenterprise e-business initiatives." Only 10%
responded "not very important" or "does not matter." In light of these
responses, it should come as no surprise that the vast majority of vendors
are now moving at breakneck speed to bring truly Web-based products to
market.


45% Critical
45% Somewhat important
9% Not very important
1% Does not matter


Marketplaces And Portals
Despite the spectacular rise and fall of public marketplaces, many
participants remain bullish on marketplace technology. Additionally, most
respondents envision portals emerging as a central part of the IT
ecosystem, though response here was less positive than for marketplaces.


Will the use of e-marketplaces (private, public, or other) eventually be an
important piece of a corporation's e-business initiatives?
More than 90% answered positively, with 50% saying "without a doubt;" 41%
responding "probably;" and only 1% saying "definitely not." As our readers
have seen us comment many times, we believe that the bulk of future
marketplace activity will be centered around private marketplaces.


50% Without a doubt
41% Probably
8% Probably not
1% Definitely not


Will corporate portals eventually constitute the main "window" through
which users are able to access multiple, heterogeneous software
applications, along with relevant content, analytic analysis? Slightly less
than 90% responded in the affirmative, with 34% saying "without a doubt;"
and 53% responding "probably." While we agree that portal technology is
important, we believe that the jury is still out on whether or not this
will prove to be a profitable, stand-alone product offering.


34% Without a doubt
53% Probably
12% Probably not
1% Definitely not


Suite Versus Best-Of-Breed
Respondents were by and large not in the suite camp, though they drew a
clear distinction between emerging and mature technologies.


Which approach will win over the long run, a best-of-breed approach or
buying an entire suite from a single vendor? Only 13% voted in favor of the
suite approach, though only 30% voted for best-of-breed. The majority (57%)
opted for the more neutral answer that "best-of-breed will win when dealing
with emerging technologies and the suite approach will win when dealing
with more mature technologies." The comments of one participant stressed
the difference between mission-critical and less-important functionality,
and offered hope for smaller vendors, particularly those with vertical
focus. He wrote, "corporations will opt for best-of-breed software where it
addresses part of their mission critical activities, but will opt for a
suite activities that are not central to their core business. As a result,
many niche vendors will emerge as very important, particularly those that
correctly and deeply solve specific problems in a given vertical."


30% Best of breed
13% Suite
57% Best-of-breed will win when dealing with emerging technologies and the
suite approach will win when dealing with more mature technologies


Obstacles To Adoption
Regarding obstacles to adoption there was little consensus among
respondents, though it was clear that many obstacles remain, and remain
challenging.


With respect to obstacles that inhibit broader adoption of e-business
software solutions, please rank the obstacles below. All obstacles listed
came in neck-and-neck for the lead, with "user adoption: challenges of
changing business process and behavior" topping the list. One person
commented, "success of implementation resides in a company's ability to
manage change and understand that this is not a system added or a plug-in,
but a new approach to the existing way their businesses is conducted."


Regarding "integration challenges with existing, internal applications,"
one participant wrote, "integration of applications in a timely and
cost-effective manner continues to be the single most important challenge
facing e-business adoption." The challenges involved with data mapping was
also cited as another key obstacle by one respondent.


1 User adoption: challenges of changing business process and behavior
2 Integration challenges with existing, internal applications
3 High cost and lengthy time of implementation
4 Questionable or insufficient ROI
5 Integration challenges with external business partners


Market leadership
Who will be the most important e-business software vendor in five years? On
this front participants ranked Microsoft No. 1, followed closely by Oracle,
SAP, and IBM. Sun also appeared as a write-in candidate. However, stressing
the ever-entrepreneurial nature of the e-business software sector, one
respondent commented, "it is very possible that the most important
e-business software vendor will be a start up who is not on anybody's radar
screen yet."

I received advice today from our outside law firm in Tokyo regarding their
final conclusions on the Japanese tax issues relating to the non-Japanese
trading offices trading with Japanese counterparties. The following is a
summary of their advice:
A. Cash Settled Derivatives Transactions
1. Swap, Options and Other Financial Derivative Transactions
Based on the current practice of the Japanese tax authorities, standard
swaps, options and similar financial transactions with symmetrical payment
flows should not be subject to withholding tax. However, to the extent that
Enron transactions involve asymmetrical payments, concern exists that imputed
interest from the imbedded loan could be subject to interest withholding tax.
2. Consumption Tax (VAT) and Excise Taxes
Although Japan imposes a 5% consumption tax (VAT), financial transactions are
generally not subject to the consumption tax, so cash settled derivative
transactions should generally not be subject to consumption tax.  Japan
imposes various excise taxes, some of which apply to commodities that are the
subject to Enron Online transactions, such as petroleum excise tax.  Such
excise taxes generally apply to physical importation and domestic sale and
delivery of covered products and should generally not apply to purely
financial derivatives transactions which reference commodity prices.
3. Collateral for Derivatives Transactions
If Enron entities will take collateral from Japan-based customers in
connection with derivative transactions, depending upon the specific
arrangements, withholding tax liability might arise.  For example, if an
Enron trading entity takes cash collateral from a Japan-based customer and
pays interest on it, such interest payments could be subject to local
withholding tax when paid to the Japanese resident customer.
B. Physically Settled Transactions
1. Consumption Tax
Japan imposes consumption tax (VAT) on the importation of tangible goods and
on domestic transfers of tangible goods. Consumption tax should be applicable
to imports of all physical commodities indicated at the Enron Online website,
including natural gas, LNG, petroleum and derivatives, coal and pulp and
paper.  Consequently, commodity contracts for physical settlement should
provide that ownership of the commodity will pass outside Japan to the
Japan-based customer.  As owner of the products upon import, the Japan-based
customer would act as importer for consumption tax purposes and in that
capacity would handle formalities upon import, pay import consumption tax and
then credit or seek a refund for the resulting input consumption tax.
If, instead, the title to the commodities is transferred after such
commodities enter Japan, each Enron entity that sells to Japan would be
required to register as a taxpayer for consumption tax purposes, pay
consumption tax upon import and file consumption tax returns.  While such an
arrangement is feasible, in practice, other industries have encountered
resistance from customs authorities (who administer the import consumption
tax system) to the designation of a non-resident entity as formal importer.
2. Excise Tax
Japan imposes an excise tax on the importation and transfer of various
commodities, including natural gas, LNG, crude oil, and refined petroleum
products.  Petrochemicals may also be subject to excise tax depending upon
the specific product. Other commodities listed at the website, including
coal, plastics (except if a specific product were characterized as a
petrochemical subject to excise tax), and pulp and paper, are not subject to
excise tax.  Again, Enron entities should transfer ownership of commodities
before they reach Japan so that the Japan-based customer acts as importer and
has responsibility for payment of excise taxes.
C. Tax Representations
The trading offices considered were those located in the US, the UK,
Singapore, Australia, Canada, Spain and Norway. Japan has tax treaties in
force with all of these countries.  Consequently, with respect to GTCs
entered into with these trading offices, the tax payor and payee
representations may provide that:
(1) the counterparty agree and represent that withholding tax will not apply
and will not be deducted from payments it makes to Enron entities, and
(2) with respect to payments the counterparty will receive from Enron
entities, it is eligible to claim relief under the business profits article
of an applicable tax treaty and does not have a permanent establishment in
the paying Enron entity,s jurisdiction.
Please let me know if you have any questions, need any additional information
or would like me to forward our outside advisor,s memo on this subject to you.

Since our meeting on Tuesday, we completed additional research on the invoices from the pipeline.  I have attached a spreadsheet that provides summaries of the invoiced amounts and details of the cash out charges for gas and penalties.  Also attached is a few pages of the pipeline tariff that addresses the required process for the pipeline to collect demand/reservation fees from the Releasing Shippers, Boston Gas and NYSEG, if the Replacement Shippers, ENA and EES, do not make on-time payments.

SUMMARY

For the capacity release contracts, it appears that Tennessee  is using the bankruptcy filing to satisfy their tariff requirements of issuing non-payment notice, and termination notice due to non-payment that are required before the pipeline can bill the Releasing Shippers, Boston Gas and NYSEG, for the reservation charges that were not paid by ENA and EES.  I have not been able to find any other letters sent to Enron from Tennessee regarding non-payment.  See attached Sheet No. 337A, 338, 355, 356 and 405.
The Boston Gas capacity release deal appears to be the largest $ amount of Tennessee's claim.  For November and December, $374,500.00 of the claim is associated with the reservation fees of Boston Gas' contract.  For January, $373,660.00 is the reservation fee.  The remaining portion of the bills are commodity and commodity surcharge expenses.  For the months of February and March, ENA posted a capacity release transaction on the pipeline EBB.  Each month, the deal was posted at 100% maximum rate transaction with Boston Gas as the pre-arranged party.  Therefore there should not be a continuing for those months.  At Boston Gas' request, both postings specified that the releases were subject to bid.
Tennessee's listing of contracts in the bankruptcy filing excludes the five contracts designated as "ENA Agent-Nomination and Billing".  This makes sense in that ENA was just a middle-man and transportation charges were being passed through to the customer.  Tennessee must be billing the customers directly!
For the Cash Out and Level Charges (i.e. penalties), there are two summaries that describe the information that you requested.  I believe that it is important to distinguish between current and prior month.  Current month imbalance numbers are usually tracked by the pipeline and are available to shippers with a couple of day lag time.  Prior month imbalances are made by the pipeline when accounting problems and issues result in reallocations of shipper volumes.  For example, in the Dec 2001 invoice dated 1/14/2002 for ENA's K# 80045, current month imbalance was 34,266 Dth due the pipeline or $92,323.29.  Since gas was due the pipeline, a Level Charge or $38,997.33 was also due the pipeline.  Prior month cash outs of 134,869 Dth or $887,821.20 due ENA also appeared in the same bill.  This adjustment covered the months of Oct 2000 through April 2001.  Another prior period adjustment will probably be made by the pipeline for May 2001 through December 2001 time period.  Please note that the Average $/Unit price is a simple average and not what is shown as the cash out gas price on the invoice.
For ENA, the storage agreement was used post-petition so that the storage inventory could be withdrawn.  It is my understanding that ENA has not paid the invoices yet.  There may be an issue whether or not the discounted rate was in effect for the last month that withdrawals took place.  ENA is waiting to see what the billed rate is before a payment is made to the pipeline.
EES's LMSMA balancing agreement is tied to serving one of EES's former customers.  The pipeline has expressed an interest in retroactively transferring this agreement and obligations over to the new supplier.  We are still trying to get additional information on the timing from EES.
As you can tell from the summary, there is some miscellaneous charges that have popped up.  One is clearly designated as a Late Payment Charge.  The others could probably fall into a similar category.


We have tried to summarize the facts.  I will leave it up to you to decide whether the amounts are prepetition or post petition.

Travis:

Here  are my general comments on the May 1st draft of the TSH License Agreement  between Enron and Accenture.  I have not tried to provide detailed drafting  comments, but there are many, many problems with the draft.  I have limited  my comments to what I consider the bigger issues.  Some of my comments may  have already been addressed by Andy, but since I am starting fresh on this, I thought  that I would just comment on everything.  I look forward to talking with  you further about this.

1.    Which is the correct Enron entity?  I assume that this  should be an agreement with Enron Networks.  Does Accenture expect a parent  guaranty?  Does Accenture expect a broader exclusivity that binds Enron  Corp. and its affiliates?  I assume that we want to limit the scope of the  exclusivity to Enron Networks.

2.    The description of EnronOnline is much too broad "various  goods and raw materials".  This needs to be limited to certain  products.

3.    I don't understand why Accenture is licensing aggregate  data.  I thought the service to be established was to provide re-formatted  data to individual Enron customers.  That would require only  customer-specific data.

4.    Will Enron be receive "real time" data transfers?   Will this be true in the sense that it will be the same time as Enron transmits  information to the customer?  I assume that there may be a lag in time  between the completion of a transaction and the transmission of the transaction  data.

5.    In Section 2.1(a), the scope of the "exclusive" license  needs to be carefully thought through and narrowed as much as possible.   What is "post-transaction data", and why does Accenture need/want an exclusive  license on aggregate data?  Also regarding the exclusive license, we need  to consider all necessary exceptions to the exclusivity, such as Enron's  internal use, transmission to the customer, etc.  Also, all transmissions  of customer-specific data require the customer's prior consent; the exclusivity  should apply only if that consent is  obtained by Accenture, and only for  as long as that consent is valid.

6.    One key aspect of an exclusive license is how it is  terminated.  Normally there are increasing minimum royalties associated  with the licensee's continued exclusive rights.  Often the licensee has the  right not to pay the minimum royalties, in which case the license can convert to  a non-exclusive or the license can terminate.

7.    In Section 2.1(a), there is a reference to Accenture's  right to sublicense.  This right needs to be carefully narrowed and clearly  stated.  Can Accenture remarket the data to anyone other than the  customer?

8.    The term "Customer" is confusing.  In Section 2.1(b),  it would seem to relate only to EnronOnline customers, but later in that section  it speaks of "its [Accenture's] customers.  In the definition schedule, the  term is not limited to EnronOnline's customers.

9.    In Section 2.2, the same comments in points 5 apply to the  exclusive license of the software.

10.    There is a reference in Section 2.2 to "updates and  revisions."  Will Enron be responsible for these?  What continuing  services will Enron be obligated to offer for the software?  Will Enron be  entitled to receive and use any improvements or updates that Accenture may make  to the software?

11.    Should the scope of the license be limited  geographically?  Why is it worldwide?  If it is worldwide, what  happens if Accenture does not market in some countries?  Is Enron excluded  from using or licensing the data in those countries?

12.    In Section 2.3, I assume that Enron will dictate the  format of the data to be received, and that Enron may revised that format from  time to time.

13.    Section 2.3(a) has some language that says that Enron will  provide... the interface between Accenture and Enron?... and "any other software  developed by or on behalf of Enron necessary for Accenture to perform its  obligations to its Customers?  That is ridiculously broad.  What  obligations to Accenture's customers?  I can't imagine that Enron would  give Accenture additional software for "free", especially if Enron spent  considerable amounts developing it.  Additional software may require  additional license fees, etc.

14.    The concept of service levels and service level  credits (in Section 2.3) is typical in service agreements.  I wonder what  Accenture has in mind.  They certainly resist any meaningful service levels  or credits when they are providing service.

15.    Section 2.4 is truly amazing.  It is so broad that  Accenture could argue that anything Enron does adversely affects Accenture and  that Enron has to pay Accenture...  If Enron is willing to provide  Accenture with a non-compete in addition to the exclusive license, then these  provisions need to be harmonized and carefully limited.  Perhaps Accenture  thought that this provision was for the benefit of Enron, in that it enables  Enron to complete potentially competitive transactions without violating the  exclusivity license (although in my view the language of the license doesn't  really reach this point).  We need to discuss the business points that  Accenture is trying to address in this section and start again with the  drafting.

16.    Section 2.5 is yet another twist  on exclusivity.  This also needs to be tied into the scope of the  exclusivity provisions.  If an Enron Customer hates Accenture and refuses  to do business with them, then what happens?  Can Enron provide the service  to that customer?  If so, what is the effect of the exclusive right in  Section 2.5?

17.    Section 2.5 also contains a reference to "co-branding  marketing" activities, and requires Enron to support and assist Accenture.   This is much too broad.  Enron may or may not wish to engage in  "co-branding marketing" activities, and if so they need to be narrowly defined  at the time.

18.    The exception in Section 2.5 to Enron's provision of the  data services is very troubling, as it would appear that Accenture is trying to  limit Enron's discretion in establishing its own pricing.  If Accenture  really wants this type of protection, we need to review it with antitrust  counsel.

19.    The payment terms seem extraordinarily generous for  Accenture.  It would be highly unusual in my experience to have license  fees paid only once per year.

20.    Not that I would know, but the minimum payments seem very  low to me.  The minimum payments is the best way to establish whether  Accenture has met its obligations to market, etc., so that it can keep its  exclusive rights.  I would think that the minimum fees would be  significantly higher.  They could be indexed to the number of transactions,  customers or transaction value of EnronOnline, so that if EnronOnline grew  faster than expected, Accenture would have to keep pace or loose its  exclusivity.

21.    The use of "Gross TSH Revenues" as part of the formula for  royalties is typical, but it presents a very significant challenge because  Accenture will have other relationships with its customers and may under price  this service (e.g., as a loss leader), and try to make their money on consulting  services.    It would be better for Enron if we could come up  with a transaction fee, that Accenture would have to pay Enron for each  transaction/transmission of data to a customer (indexed appropriately), and then  let Accenture worry about how it makes money.

22.    We need to consider the tax issues further.  I think  that the fees paid to Enron for data transmission/resale and for the software  may be subject to state sales tax.  Accenture should be responsible for at  least the taxes related to the data transmission/resale.  If it is  reselling these services to its customers, it can provide Enron with a resale  exemption certificate.  The license of software is probably not subject to  the same exemption and may be taxable in any event.  That would require us  to split the revenue stream between the two types of services (data and  software), or run the risk that the whole stream is taxable regardless of the  resale certificate.  We need to consider these issues further with tax  counsel.

23.    [I'll skip commenting on the IP provisions of Article IV  for now.  Suffice it to say that they need work.  But we need to work  out the business deal before worrying too much about these provisions.  But  they will be critical to our agreement with Accenture.]

24.    The Term is another amazing provision.  First, five  years is a very long time in my view to have an exclusive license for this type  of new/evolving business.  Second, Accenture's proposal for a  unilateral option to extend it for five more years is a bold move.  But it  seems ridiculous to me that the minimum annual payments for those additional  years (of exclusive rights, I assume), would be fixed at $1 million.   Surely they jest.

25.    Enron needs a way to terminate this license early, either  through a buy-out right or a termination for convenience with a payment.   Also, if Accenture is violating the terms of the license or otherwise violating  "material" terms of this Agreement (which we may have to identify), Enron should  have the right to terminate.  I have often used the approach that the  licensor should not be permitted to terminate except in the event of a payment  default, but we should seek much more.  Especially if Enron only gets paid  once a year.

26.    I noticed that Accenture did not offer any  representations.  Some would be appropriate.

27.    The liability/indemnity section is interesting in that it  lacks any indemnity by Accenture to Enron's benefit.  I would think that  Accenture would indemnify Enron for all claims by customers relating to  Accenture's service (e.g., mapping errors, translation errors, etc.), except if  directly related to Enron's error.  We need to discuss this risk  model.  We have to assume that EnronOnline's customers would come after  both Accenture and EnronOnline, and we need to consider how these claims should  be handled.

28.    The limits of liability are interesting.  I wonder  what the story is behind the $25 million limit for us, and the $5 million limit  for them.

29.    We would not accept the exclusions to the consequential  damages as drafted; and we would want to exclude claims related to Accenture's  breach of Enron's IP rights from any consequential damage limitation.   [That will get their attention.]

30.    The "worldwide license" provisions of Section 9.1 require  some discussion.  I doubt that Enron intends to get consents for and make  all filings in countries where Accenture wants to sell these  services.

See  you on Monday at 9:30am.  Feel free to call me earlier on Monday or at home  tonight (713 661-3279).

Hi all,

We spoke to Rick Simpson in Hertzberg's office who related the
following:

The last meeting of Senate, Assembly, and Governor's staff was last
Wednesday.  The Senate staff has been advised that the Governor is not
interested in having a bill that could only pass the Senate.  He wants
one that can get 41 votes in the Assembly as well, which means direct
access would have to be included.  Rick spoke to Brian Kelly of Burton's
office on Friday.  Brian said they are working on securitizing the
interest costs.  They are looking at something like 50-60 kw for the
core/non-core number which would still be able to be financed even with
fewer customers, although the transaction costs would be higher with a
smaller customer base.  I asked Rick if they expect all of their members
to return and he said most of them would.  I suggested that it had
better be the right ones, or they'd have trouble getting to 41 votes.
He said he wasn't sure at this point if a compromise bill could be ready
by next Tuesday, but the Assembly is willing to try with the right bill.

I spoke to John Burton a few minutes ago who reiterated that he will not
look favorably upon including direct access although he understands that
some business democrats in the Assembly need it to vote for a
bailout.    He said he spoke to an Assembly leader this morning who told
him that even 78xx would get only 36 votes today if it came up for a
vote (it squeeked through on 41).  He is considering putting up 78xx for
a vote on Tuesday (it will fail) and continuing discussions with the
Governor's office after that.  He said to tell you all that the bailout
bill can't pass next week because it interferes with Scott and Gayle's
wedding on the 14th, and coincidentally that is the last day for the
Governor to sign or veto bills.

These transfers should be made effective July 1, 2001to effect a clean cut-off for accounting purposes.  I am sending these today to give you as much lead time as possible, but please do not make them effective any sooner.
Could each cost center lead please keep up with who is on their list today and, if employees are hired or terminated between now and July 1, 2001, make the appropriate adjustment with your respective HR representative to make sure they are transferred properly.
Rachel M., can you use this data to pull together a Q3 and Q4 plan for each cost center (working with the leads of each area).
Thanks

Later today we will receive the 2 plan proposals (one from the Grids and Entergy, etal. and one from Southern, Santee Cooper, GTC, etal).  Our response is due to the judge on Friday by 3:30.  We will have a meeting this week to discuss our response (our SE team -- (Joe, Luiz, and me) -- will prepare the response).

The judge has then scheduled the mediation "negotiations" for next Tues and Wed. in DC.  She is only allowing 3 parties from each sector to actually attend.  The power marketer sector reps are Enron, Williams and PSEG.  I will attend the negotiations for Enron.  The majority of IPP/trading entities chose to be in the IPP sector, which is represented by Calpine, Reliant and DENA.  Our views are very consistent in these two sectors.

The judge hopes to have a consensus reached during the negotiation phase*, but will make her own recommendation to FERC on what the SE RTO should look like absent a consensus.  She plans to report to the Commission the first week of Sept.



*No party is waiving any rights to protest her decision by participating in the negotiations, and clearly, those not attending retain their rights.  She simply wants to have a smaller group to facilitate the discussion next week.

The EPSA Leg. Affairs Committee is having a special meeting this afternoon (out of the normal biweekly cycle) to discuss how EPSA should respond to the Barton RTO discussion draft.  In addition to the e-mail yesterday morning, I spoke in person with Gene Peters of the EPSA staff to convey our strongly held view that mere "technical corrections" were not enough to fix the Barton RTO proposal, as the EPSA draft letter stated.  Gene came around because in a subsequent meeting we had with Rep. Chip Pickering (R-MS), a member of the House Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee, Gene said that silence would be better than what is in the Barton draft.

He did indicate to me (not to Pickering) that some EPSA members, without naming them, didn't want to come down too hard on Barton because in their view the draft could have been worse.  These unnamed companies (or company?) claim to have told of earlier versions not released that would have been more restrictive on FERC's discretion.  Some companies also think FERC could wiggle out of the strictures of the draft.  I told Gene that there is no way to wiggle out of the definitions of minimum size/scope that FERC would be forced to accept and the various procedural advantages for recalcitrant utilities.

While I am checking with counterparts at other EPSA members in advance of the afternoon meeting, you might want to do the same as you speak with contacts at other EPSA members.  I am confident we can get the EPSA letter to better reflect our position -- my suspicion is that the unnamed company Gene referred to is Reliant, but I can't prove it.

I believe there is a potential "anti-trust" issue brewing at BPA. I know BPA
is subject to different rules than most other entities, however, I have
sought to understand how they are acquiring power from customers, or allowing
some customers to install small scale generation and BPA buys that power,
without it hitting the federal transmission system.

It may not be an issue in as much as Enron, or other marketing entities, may
not want to compete with BPA to purchase power from these small generation
units.

However, if we were interested in buying this energy that's too bad because
we can't get access to it.

BPA's Power Business Line (PBL) is making arrangements with local utilities
and with those utilities industrial customers through which the customer
installs small generation units and the PBL is purchasing the output. In this
instance the customers load is not reduced. BPA is concerned that if the
customer reduces load they (BPA) will lose revenue, as will the host utility
(distribution costs). So the concept is that the generator simply continue to
buy "priority firm" energy through the host utility and they sell the output
of the small generator to BPA. But, because it takes so long to get through
BPA's Transmission Business Line's (TBL's) interconnection and system study
process, the PBL is simply going around that process. This treats the output
as though it is going to BPA's grid without reducing the host utilities load.
However, the PBL is not seeking to "interconnect" these loads with the
federal grid because it takes too long to do that.

If Enron wants to buy power from a small generator, either Enron or the host
utility or the industrial customer will have to go through BPA's extensive
analysis process.  In one instance I am aware of, the industrial customer
would like to get a market price for the output of their generator but BPA is
telling them they will only pay a price much lower than market ($90-110 MWhr)
for the next year. The generator feels they are held hostage to BPA's offer
because they are not able to get onto the federal transmission network.

Seems like anti-trust to me. Or, at a minimum, self-dealing which I believe
FERC has sought to avoid.

Jeff

On Wednesday, Sept. 13, we will be using the new version of EnronOnline
(website and Stack Manager) for all North American internal users.
Please log into the temporary website: http://Prod.EnronOnline.com (no www.)
This is a LIVE website and all trades are REAL.
Content of this Email
1. Introduction
2. Version 2.0 Launch Date
3. New Website Features
4. New Stack Manager Features
5. Your Participation
6. Contacts
1. Introduction
We are planning to launch version 2.0 of EnronOnline to customers within the
next few days.  In preparation for this launch, the new web site will be
released to internal users in North America on Wednesday, September 13th.
European internal users will be launched shortly after North America.
External customers will follow a few days later.
One of the purposes of the internal launch is to simulate the system load
which will be caused by the full customer launch.  Accordingly, we appreciate
your cooperation in helping us to simulate this load by logging into
http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.)  This is a live web site and all trades
are real.
New features (as per recent presentations and training sessions) include:
Price limit orders
Enhanced customization
Floating windows
Market news and quotes
Weather maps and tables
Industry-specific publications
Market-specific homepages
2. Version 2.0 Launch Date
EnronOnline Version 2.0 will be launched to the public a few days after our
internal launch. We  will be using the new version internally from Wednesday,
Sept. 13. This will provide an opportunity for you to become familiar with
using the new application in the production environment before our customers
start to use it.
3. New Website Feature Details
Price limit orders: Customers have the ability to set up orders that
automatically execute as soon as the price and volume requested become
available. The limit orders remain open in the system until they are
executed, cancelled by the user, or when they expire. All pending orders will
expire no later than 12 hours after being placed.
Pending Price Limit Orders will appear in a new window below the Quotes
screen in the website.
Product tabs: EnronOnline users can use enhanced filtering capabilities to
create separate page tabs for the products that interest them.  Users can
instantly access each page tab with a click of their mouse. Sort Ordering can
be changed by clicking on a column heading, with multiple sorts possible by
holding down the shift key while clicking.
Floating windows: Users have the ability to create multiple windows with
different products by right-clicking on the products in the main quotes
screen.
Market news: Website users can now access the latest headlines, sports and
industry news from Reuters. Furthermore, the information categories can be
customized according to personal interests. To customize a particular
category, users need to click the Edit button in the category heading.
All information categories can be collapsed to save space. To expand or
collapse a category, users need to click the arrow to the left of the
category heading.
Stock quotes: EnronOnline now offers stock quotes (20 min. delay) from major
exchanges around the world.
Weather insights: Customers can now access weather maps and temperature data
for specific cities and regions.  Weather forecasts, up to six days ahead,
and temperature differentials from periodic averages are now available.
Industry publications: Website users can read a wide range of
industry-specific publications including Argus European Natural Gas, Argus
European Electricity, the news from NGI,s Daily Gas Price Index, Bandwidth
Desk, Coal Daily and more.
4. New Stack Manager Features
The Stack Manager has been updated to facilitate Price Limit Orders. You will
notice that there is a new button at the top of the Stack Manager, which will
open a window showing a summary of the best Price Limit Order bids and offers
against your managed products. You can click the "+" sign to the left of a
summary to show a list of all the Price Limit Orders which have been placed
against that product.
Under normal circumstances, the price shown on the website will be the same
as the price on your Stack Manager. However, the system will not allow you to
show a price which is better than an existing Price Limit Order. Instead, the
system will show a price on the website equivalent to the prevailing Price
Limit Order while it is being filled. Once the appropriate Price Limit Orders
are filled, then the website will again show your Stack Manager prices.
It is important that you complete the &Maximum Volume8 field in the Product
Properties window and that you select "Allow Price Limit Orders". Also, make
sure that the price tick window in the Stack Manager,s &Product Properties8
field is appropriate for the product. If you do not do this, your customers
will not be able to use Price Limit Orders for your products.
5. Your Participation
Please log in to http://prod.enrononline.com (no www.) on Wednesday. To
ensure EnronOnline Version 2.0 is a success, it is important that you have a
full understanding of the new features and help promote the system to your
customers.

On Monday, the Mediator in this case informed the parties that he planned to recommend to the FERC that it adopt a methodology for computing refunds that largely parallels the methodology that FERC adopted for prospective price ceilings in its June 19 order.  That methodology caps prices at a so-called competitive market price proxy equal to the operting cost of the last genertor dispatched in an hour, which will almost always be a single cycle gas plant with a relatively high heat rate.  The Mediator said that he would recommend that this measure be applied from October 2 forward; that it use the actual heat rate and NOx cost of the units dispatched; and that it include a 10 percent adder for credit risk.  Apparently, but not entirely clear, the Mediator will also recommend that two retroactive price caps actually be applied:  one for Northern California, using  the average price of gas at the PG&E citygate and Malin, and another for Southern California, using the SoCal Gas large package price for gas.  The Mediator finally informed the parties that he would recommend that FERC convene an evidentiary hearing to be concluded in 60 days for the purpose of taking testimony on, among other things, what were the actual operating costs of marginal generators in both the North and South.

The group of power marketers of which Enron is a part was obviously disappointed that the Mediator and his staff felt bound to use this methodology based in generator costs, even while acknowledging that it has little relevance to the cost or value of a marketer's supply portfolio.  The group also expressed interest in participating jointly and using a joint expert witness in the evidentiary hearing.   I have contacted Seabron Adamson who said he would have not conflict in serving as an expert witness for the group.

If (as appears likely) a hearing is convened in the very near term, it will be imperative to nail down selection of an expert immediatly so that he can begin preparing discovery to be sent out as soon as a procedural schedule is put in effect.  Thus it would be helpful if you could let me know as soon as possible how you wish to proceed.  Do you want to participate in the hearing individually or as part  of a group?  Do you want to sponsor an expert witness? and, if so, do you want to use Seabron or someone else.

As you consider this last question, you should be aware that  PowerEx has interests largely alligned with the marketer group.   PowerEx is going to sponsor Richard Tabors.  Tabors, in turn, recommended to me that the marketers use Seabron because he believes their strengths complement each other.

Further to my email of Nov. 29th, Tim has now signed off on the usage of this
list. Chris Foster ok'd it several weeks ago.

Tim has asked that both of you let me know of any objections/comments to this
list by the close of business today. Otherwise,  it will be used from
tomorrow onwards. As indicated previously, we only plan to send it to
counterparties who request to have something in writing which details the key
distinctions between the EEI and the WSPP.

Thanks,

Shari and Christian

___________

1. WSPP Section 10 - Definition of "Uncontrollable Force": This definition is
too broad.   It sets out a litany of events, any one of which may be
considered an Uncontrollable Force  by a Party seeking to avoid having to pay
liquidated damages in respect of a Firm Transaction under which it  has
committed to sell or deliver "firm" energy. For instance, it is hard to
imagine that a "drought" is a legitimate excuse to relieve a Party of its
obligation to deliver Firm Power. How can a drought cause power not to flow?
What is a "material shortage"? etc...  In contrast, EEI's definition of Force
Majeure does not include a lengthy list from which a party could pick and
choose to its advantage; rather the key to the EEI definition is that it
characterizes FM as an event that "prevents one Party from performing its
obligations".

Related to this critically important concept of firm deliverability, where
precise wording is very important,  is the puzzling existence of Section 25
of the WSPP Agreement:

"25. JUDGMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS:
Whenever it is provided in this Agreement that a Party shall be the sole
judge of whether, to what extent, or under what conditions it will provide a
given service, its exercise of its judgment shall be final and not subject to
challenge.  Whenever it is provided that (i) a service under a given
transaction may be curtailed under certain conditions or circumstances, the
existence of which are determined by or in the judgment of a Party, or ...
that Party's or the Executive Committee's determination or exercise of
judgment shall be final and not subject to challenge if it is made in good
faith and not made arbitrarily or capriciously."

Whatever the intent  of this wording may have been,   what is clear is that
it could only cause problems  in resolving a deliverability issue.

2.  WSPP Section 27- "Creditworthiness".  This clause is too subjective.  It
would allow one party, for potentially wrong reasons,  to unilaterally
question the other's financial viability and require it to post collateral in
an amount which is a "reasonable estimate of the damages" to the requesting
party.  If such collateral is not provided within the allotted time frame, an
Event of Default occurs. In contrast, the EEI provides for an objective test
in Section 8.1/8.2 (c) which is based on a set collateral threshold expressed
in $ and which is likely to be commensurate with the amount of unsecured
exposure that a party feels comfortable with.  In addition, Enron routinely
includes an objectively determinable  bilateral "material adverse change"
clause in the EEI Cover Sheet  as a Collateral Posting Event /additional
Event of Default which would be  triggered by a party's credit rating not
meeting investment grade criteria or certain financial covenants/ratios.  We
believe that this combination provides an objectively determinable level of
credit protection which both Parties can understand and agree to before
entering into any transactions under the agreement.

3. All of the following points related to early termination of an agreement
are very  important to any Non-Defaulting party in the precarious
circumstances surrounding the termination of a complex trading relationship.
This is the area where the Agreement is going to have the most potential
legal significance  to the Parties, and this is an area where the WSPP comes
up short of the EEI in some fairly substantial ways.

Events of Default and Early Termination.   The list of events which can
become Events of Default is too short.  The absence of important events
creates significant legal risk.  For instance, Section 22.1(b) speaks to a
failure by a party to have made accurate representations and warranties as
required by Section 36.  Section 36 is the Trade Option Exemption. This begs
the question as to what happens in the event of a breach of Section 37?
Section 37 is where the parties represent that they have the authority to
enter into these types of transactions, have all necessary regulatory
authorizations, etc..  With no Event of Default relating to a breach of these
Section 37  rep's and warranties, what would one's remedy be in the event of
a breach of Section 37?  In contrast, the EEI has a clear Event of Default
based on a breach of rep's and warranties.  And, consider this example:
the WSPP Agreement does not make it an Event of Default if a Party breaches a
material covenant of the Agreement.   This basic legal point which appears in
the EEI agreement is entirely missing.

In addition to those listed in the WSPP Agreement, the EEI contains the
following additional Events of Default : Merger without Assumption, Cross
Default, Default by a Party's Guarantor (breach of rep., failure to pay,
bankruptcy, expiry of guarantee while transactions are outstanding,
repudiation of guaranty).

Calculation of Early Termination Payment: In order to calculate the value of
any prematurely terminated transactions occasioned by an Early Termination
Event, the WSPP requires a party to use a "market quotation comparison"
method and go out into the market and obtain the present value of the
affected transactions. Any related hedges that the Non-Defaulting Party has
in place and now no longer needs cannot be included in the calculations. In
contrast, the EEI,  as supplemented in our proposed Cover Sheet,  would allow
the Non-Defaulting Party the flexibility to calculate a good faith estimate
of its Loss by using quotes or internal calculations. The NDP would also be
allowed to take into account any hedges or breakage costs associated with
having had to terminate the transactions early as a result of the other
party's default.

Another problematic point in the WSPP is in Section 22.2 where it requires
the Non-Defaulting Party to exercise its right of termination within 30 days
of learning about an Event of Default. (An event does not become an "Event of
Default" until notice and failure to cure has occurred.) Where  an event has
been established as an Event of Default,   if the Non-Defaulting Party does
not call a termination within this timeframe (and, if no extension is granted
by mutual agreement ), the Non-Defaulting Party forfeits its right to
terminate.  This unnecessary time restriction can only cause trouble in the
already difficult circumstances that will exist in a potential termination
situation.   In contrast, under the EEI, at any time so long as an Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, the Non-Defaulting Party has the
right to designate an Early Termination Date and terminate all transactions.

4. Governing Law- The WSPP provides for Utah law to govern the agreement in
most situations. Most physical power counterparties are not located in Utah
and so are not familiar with this law. We would prefer to have a more
developed state law govern a power trading contract. The EEI provides for NY
law which is well suited to handling trading related disputes.  It is
generally recognized that New York commercial law, expecially in the
important trading related areas of oral trading and bankruptcy is superior to
the law of most other states.  The ISDA, for example, uses New York law for
these reasons.

5. Dispute Resolution.   The WSPP Agreement invokes arbitration and the EEI
agreement does not.  We prefer arbitration, however, the WSPP version of it
is unnecessarily complex.   First, it is not clear under the WSPP Agreement
that all claims or disputes arising under it are able to be arbitrated.  Some
disputes can be arbitrated, some cannot.    Our preferred approach would be
to use arbitration for all claims or disputes.  Then, assuming that a
permissible dispute is being arbitrated, the WSPP has a complicated mandatory
"informal" and then "formal" dispute resolution procedure which requires the
constant involvement of the WSPP Chair and the Chair's pre-chosen list of
mediators.  We think it would be better to have each party select an
arbitrator, and then have these two arbitrators select a third independent
arbitrator with at least 8 years experience in the electricity markets. We
also think it would be fairer for the dispute to be settled using the
arbitration methods set forth by the American Arbitration Association.

6. Payment Netting and Closeout  Netting/Set-off.    A good master trading
agreement should clearly address both  payment netting and close out netting
and set-off in separate, explicit paragraphs of the agreement.  They are
separate topics.    The EEI does this.  Section 6.4 deals with payment
netting  and  Sections 5.3 and  5.6 deal with settlement netting and closeout
setoffs.     These unambiguous paragraphs provide very explicit terms under
which these important concepts are addressed and thus provide  a valuable
credit management tool on which the parties can rely.   The WSPP Agreement,
on the other hand, fails to clearly distinguish between payment netting and
closeout netting/setoff.  Section 28.1 seems to be dealing with payment
netting and the reference to set off is incomplete and ambiguous as to
whether or not it applies to closeout setoff.  Furthermore, Section 28.2
provides that a party that elects to use payment netting must post this
information on the WSPP homepage "(once the WSPP Homepage possesses the
necessary capability)."   What can be posted can be unposted.  This whole
system of confirming netting seems unnecessarily complicated.

7. Invoicing- Section 9.5 of the WSPP allows a party to send an invoice
within two (2) years from the date on which the invoice should have been
delivered.   In contrast, Section 6.1 of the EEI has no such time frame and
the parties are encouraged to send out invoices as soon as possible after the
end of each month.

9. Contested Amounts: Section 6.2 of the EEI provides that in the event of a
dispute, the owing party pays only the uncontested amount and then tries to
resolve the discrepancy. On the other hand, Section 9.4 of the WSPP requires
the contesting party to pay the entire disputed amount upfront and then try
to resolve the discrepancy.

10. Breadth of Agreement: The EEI  is  a nationwide document, drafted
recently, by participants from all parts of the country,  during the most
recent phase of wholesale deregulation, when a number of typically difficult
legal issues had already been painfully experienced by companies.        It
includes definitions for East power products as well as West power products
(including products transacted for a California Delivery Point as well as any
other Delivery Point in the WSCC).   The WSPP Agreement on the other hand
began in the west during the regulated era, and   still contains many
vestiges of  its origins that are no longer necessary, and, therefore, it
cannot yet claim the same national scope as the EEI.  For example,  it still
contemplates the regional  notion of "Membership," in the Western System
Power Pool.  What does this mean?  Why is this kind of membership necessary?
What legal value does it have?  Why should a power trading master agreement
need to have sections such as sections 8  dealing with Organization and
Administration of various committees?   No other master agreement dealing
with any other commodity, including the ISDA agreement, contains these
notions of membership and committee structures and duties in their texts.

By now, most of you have heard about the FirstEnergy Settlement, underwhich
FE will recover as best we can ascertain at this time, all of its stranded
costs.  Key components of the setllement include:
1. FE makes 1120 mw of power available at a price that varies by customer
class and increases gradually over the 5 years.  (The price does not include
line losses which the Company agreed to throw in if another marketer signs on
- none did),  The market price is also the shopping credit.  The  shopping
incentive is then added to the credit . The shopping credit for residential
and commercial customers is low but could possibly work pending analysis from
structuring.  The industrial credit is very low.
2. Customers on special contracts (approximately 800 of them), can during the
first year either opt to cancel their contract or extend it through the RTC
recovery period, which is unlawful in my view, although that observation did
not slow anyone down.
3.  The settlement creates an implicit cap on shopping of 20% since the
Company will seek to have the incentive removed once the 20% is reached.  The
agreement states that if the incentive is not removed, then customers will
pay for the incentive as a deferral which will extend the recovery period.
This too is also unlawful because it allows the recovery of generation
related costs beyond the market development period.
4.  Barring extension of the shopping incentive and other caveats, the RTC
rolls off on December 31, 2006 for Ohio Edison, June 30th, 2007 for Toledo
Edison and December 31, 2008 for Cleveland Electric Illuminating Company.
5.  Distribution rates are frozen until 2007.
6. There is a 5% residential rate cut.
7. FE absorbs the pancaking charges for power coming through PJM and MISO
until the RTO is up and running.
This settlement is basically political.  Over the past several weeks, FE has
cut a host of sidebar deals with each of the intervenors and customers who
signed on to this travesty.  When the parties were assembled for settlement
talks, they lasted 2 days before parties surrendered their litigation
positions.  The hearing schedule is equally aggregious.  Coincidentally, the
hearing examiners had a schedule in mind that was extremely similar to FE.
Our testimony is due on April 24 with no further discovery prior to its
filing.  The testimony of FE and defenders of the Stip is due on April 26.
We then have 3 days for depositions with supplemental or rebuttal testimony
being a big IF.  The hearing commences May 2.
The parties who thought it was fine to give FE $8.9 billion without
quantification or review are Consumers Counsel, Staff, Industrial Users,
Retail Merchants, Low income (some), Ohio Manufacturers, Shell Energy,
Kroger, AK Steel, Ohio Hospital Association.
Those fighting the stipulation are all the other marketers, the Cleveland
Growth Association, the City of Cleveland, Citizens Action, Citizens Power,
Safe Energy Communications Council.
By separate e-mail, Laurie Knight will send you the shopping credit and
shopping incentive numbers.  Also, if you would like a copy of the
settlement, please let Laurie know.
Two final points.  We are doing everything we can to try to improve or derail
acceptance of the settlement, although it appears to be a fait accompli.
Second, the stage has been set for similar type negotiations with the other
utilities
Please pass this memo along to anyone else who you think has an interest in
knowing this information.

Here are the basic elements of the hub concept.

NCL, Inc. at www.nationalcharityleague.org   will be the umbrella site.  Each  chapter that participates will have a web site under this umbrella.  The name will be www.nationalcharityleague/chaptername.org .  The chapters will be given a choice of 4  templates that will allow them to pick colors and graphics that they like.  Each chapter site will contain:
1.      A  front page:  a brief section about  their chapter that can be reached by anyone searching for National Charity  League.  This will be the only  public area.
2.      A  password entry area that will be based on the chapter database or list of  members that they want to have access to their site.  The password entry area will have an  area that members can update their information (change of address, e-mail,  etc.).
3.      The  password protected area will include:
a.        A member listing with address, phone numbers, etc.
b.       Philanthropies and schedules for activities
c.        Calendar
d.       Meeting Schedule (Patroness and Ticktocker)
e.        Newsletters
f.         Bylaws (searchable by keyword)
g.        Ticktocker Procedures (searchable by keyword)
h.        Standing Rules (searchable by keyword)
i.          Hours (this will be a database collection area that each chapter member  will be allowed to submit hours through.   The hours chair(s) will be able to ask for and get a report of all hours  submitted.  The individual members  will also be able to get a summary of their hours as well.
j.         And finally, a chat area for chapter members.

The cost:  A  one-time site set-up fee of approximately $500 (this could be slightly more due  to the uncertainty of additional information that chapters may want on their  site) and a $69.95 per month web hosting fee.

I will train the chapter designated person on how to load  their information onto the web area via a manual that I will prepare and at  convention and phone calls.  Our  service provider will handle technical support for non-NCL content related  problems.  Once the templates are  designed and tested, chapter sites could be ready for uploading within 2  weeks.  The template design and  testing will be done over the next several months if there is sufficient  commitment from chapters.  I'll pick  a date of January 1, 2002 for chapter sites to be ready.  It could be sooner but I have to make  sure that there are enough chapters interested before committing my time to this  project.

I can't think of anything else on this subject.

NCL, Inc. Secure Area
Each President will be given a set of user names and  passwords for her Board of Directors.   If they are not available for your meeting, I will send them to each  Board President via mail as soon as they are available.  I am meeting with our hosting company  next week and we will generate the ids and passwords then.  The NCL, Inc. Secure area will have a  directory, the National Reference Manual, NELLIE, Standard Form Bylaws and  Ticktocker Procedures, a Calendar with meeting places and phone numbers,  information on the chapters (including some names and numbers) and a variety of  forms.  There may be other things as  the need arises.    Target  date:  November 1, 2001.

Sixth Interstate Natural Gas Facility-Planning Seminar
"Presentation of Staff's Findings"
October 26, 2001
Washington, DC

Link to "Ideas" document:  http://www.ferc.gov/gas/stakeholder.pdf
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Comments due on pre-filing stakeholder "Ideas" document November 9
Overriding theme to all Action Ideas is "earlier is better"
Pre-filing process has a new docket prefix (PF) and is underway; explained in some detail
Staff seems to be looking for best practices, possibly even a vehicle for industry-wide (and public) sharing

Highlights

Though FERC's Office of Energy Projects intends to hold more public and industry outreach seminars, this sixth seminar was the last of this series; OEP presented their final draft of "Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement in the Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Planning Pre-Filing Process: Industry, Agencies, Citizens and FERC Staff."

Following this presentation, there is one last round of comments on the document due to the Outreach Team by November 9th.  The Outreach Team's goal is to release a final document by the end of this year.  Overall, the Team wants to know if they're findings are on target, and they have asked for comments that include edits, additions or omissions.  To note, however, is that "The Ideas" is seen as a "living document" by OEP, and it will be changed and updated on an ongoing basis as better practices and ideas emerge.  Again Rich Hoffmann stated that there is no intention for any of this to be included in a rulemaking or policy statement (I believed him this time).   Also, Rich clarified that "we recognize these ideas have to be customized for every project."  [This is, in fact, why the document was not issued as "guidelines" -- industry argued they would become de facto requirements.]

For comment on the document itself, we will look for ETS recommendations from interested groups (there is a link to the document above).  At the end of this memo, there is also a list of general questions from the Outreach Team.  Please send replies or comments on those questions, as well as the "Ideas" document, to me by November 7th for aggregation and inclusion in informal comments to go to the Outreach team (comments will not be filed with the Secretary).

FERC Staff Presentation

The Gas Outreach Team (Rich Hoffmann, Lauren O'Donnell, Jeff Shenot, Howard Wheeler) presented their findings of Action Options for the four major stakeholder sectors: Pipeline Industry, Agency (local, state and resource agencies), Citizen and FERC Staff.  There is a slide presentation that should be made available online soon.

There was some Q&A, but Staff was particularly eager to hear examples of how some of these ideas have been implemented successfully and if any "best practices" have emerged since the Outreach Team began these discussions.  One worry we have with Staff's preoccupation with best practices is that, at some point, they may want to formalize that idea though the publication of best practices.  They seem to be looking for a vehicle to collect and communicate best practices from pipeline company to pipeline company, and to the public.  Similar to the idea of publishing guidelines which then become de facto requirements, "best practices" can evolve into requirements as well, and such practices vary widely in use and effectiveness across different systems, projects and regions of the country.  Industry may want to protect the importance of variability and customization of approach based on what we know about certain regions and populations.

Some points of interest from the discussion include the emphasis by FERC Staff that pipeline companies appear to be most successful when they get full management support from the top at the very beginning of project development, there is a proactive company-wide philosophy, and the project team includes various parts of the company from the outset (i.e., include public affairs from the beginning as well as engineering, and have them communicate with each other regularly through the team).

NEPA Pre-Filing Process

Attesting to the emerging role of the NEPA Pre-filing Process, there is a new docket prefix, "PF," instituted to allow for public access to information on pre-filed projects.  This process is not an expedited approach that takes less time at FERC, but instead overlays the company's timeline with the FERC NEPA timeline in the development and assessment of the project.  This allows for a certificate sooner for the company in relation to their own project development process.  As an example, a NEPA Pre-Filing process could begin before the exact route has been determined, though the project must be well-defined -- while the company is holding public meetings and choosing the route, FERC could begin the scoping process.  According to OEP's assessment, this could shift the NEPA process back as much as seven months.  Under this scenario, once the company files for its certificate application, a final certificate could be issued in under ten months.

In order to use the pre-filing process, companies must meet certain qualifications.  First, a company should be prepared to fund a third party contractor to help FERC Staff prepare the certificate and NEPA requirements.  Also, there must be a real written commitment to identify and resolve issues.  And the company must be able to demonstrate that the other major NEPA organizations are prepared to cooperate on development of the NEPA assessment.  To qualify to use the NEPA pre-filing, the company files a formal request with the OEP Director answering any concerns FERC Staff may have about the project and the outlook for a successful pre-filing process.  Once accepted, that would trigger the PF docket assignment.  Currently, only the NiSource Greenbriar project is utilizing this process.


Follow-Up Questions from FERC

Along with any comments we may have on the "Ideas" document itself, FERC Staff distributed a set of three questions for consideration and/or comment from industry and the public.  The questions follow  -- note that Staff is particularly eager to collect positive anecdotes on how these ideas are already working on projects:

Part 1: Are we on target?  [Please let us know of any additions, omissions, or editorial changes you recommend for "Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement..."]
Part 2:  Ideas for implementation  [Please give us your good ideas about how to put the ideas discussed here today to work.  This can be for projects you are involved with or for other projects of which you are aware.]
Part 3: Examples of successful implementation [Please describe examples of how using these concepts helped make your experience or involvement with a project better.]

Per the broker statement received this morning the initial margin for Mann increased by only $6.1MM.  It does not appear that they have changed their margin calculation method from this.  I have contacted the Enron person responsible for confirming the amounts to be settled with Mann and instructed her to contact me if Mann requests any settlement that differs from the statement received this morning.  The preliminary number for Mann's initial margin and variation margin was a net inflow of $4.8MM.

I will let you know of any changes.  Thanks.

Hi Selena,

I received a phone call today from ITG indicating that their business persons
overlooked a step in the procedural/legal process of getting Quantex
installed.  As you know, I executed the NASDAQ, AMEX etc. agreements that
accompanied the Quantex agreement itself.  ITG indicated that they never
faxed to us one more of these such agreements that has to get done and that
they are going to fax it on Monday when the requisite operations person
returns.  Once this last statement is executed on Monday they will be able to
stall the equipment.

They further indicated that, in practical terms, there overnight should not
cause any further delay because they are just shipping the equipment today
for installation on Monday or Tuesday.  I will keep you posted.

Feel free to call me Monday afternoon for an update and to insure that we are
getting this last agreement executed.

Julie, if I have any business-IT questions, I will call you on Monday.  I
anticipate that in light of all the other agreements, everything will be
straight forward and I will get the agreement reviewed and executed pretty
quickly.

The Barton discussion draft says that FERC's hands would be tied and that they would have to approve a proposed RTO, as to size and scope, if the proposed RTO owns or has operational control over transmission facilities that serve at least 40,000 MW of load.  Southern's CEO testified in Congress recently that their load is over 35,000.  I assume the 40,000 MW minimum would permit the SeTrans proposal to meet the proposed statutory minimum since it is Southern plus a few munis, as I understand it.  Is this correct?
Who would know how many RTOs there would be if each were just over the 40,000 MW minimum?  I assume it is much more than 4-5 RTOs -- if so, this is a good contrast to use in our Hill efforts.
Thanks.

Gentlemen
I wanted to provide you an update on the status of the Refco private label platform deal.  We have had several meetings since I first presented the idea to you all.  Unfortunately, Refco's headquarters was in One World Financial Center which was severely damaged by debris from the World Trade Center collapse.  They suffered no human losses from the disaster, but their offices are off limits and all their computers and paper files are inaccessible for the time being.  They are up and running out of a Jersey City location with some back up capability.
To briefly summarize the discussion so far, ENW would build a Refco branded platform similar to EOL that would be accessed by Refco's customers.  Enron would provide transactable prices to the site with wider spreads and potentially smaller minimum volumes.  Refco customers would transact on the site with Refco as their counterparty and Refco would sleeve the transactions to Enron allowing us to consolidate our credit risk to a singular credit, Refco.   The products contemplated include various Nymex look-a-like products and other liquid swaps in oil, natural gas, and electricity.  Revenue would come to Enron in the form of license fees for the platform, transaction fees, and origination from the additional volume create by the wider margin products.  Revenue would come to Refco in the form of transaction fees.  Refco has a similar arrangement in place for FX with Dresner bank and have announced a similar platform for bonds and securities with Cantor Fitzgerald/E-speed.
All that being said, they are anxious to move the discussion forward and we have planned a visit for them to come to Houston in 2 weeks.  Attending will be Gary Weiss, SVP Refco Group Ltd. LLC and President & CEO of Refco F/X Ltd LLC, and Joe Murphy, CEO Refco Futures Ltd. LLC.  The purpose of this visit is for them to give us a presentation on the Refco Group of companies, discuss the products and estimations of revenue streams based on their current futures business, and discuss the possible structure of the deal.  The meeting is scheduled to begin at 2:30pm Thursday Oct 4 and expected to last the balance of the day and possibly into the next morning.  I will approach you all individually to get your feedback on how you would like to interact with them and when.  I realize there are significant issues to be addressed.
Refco currently has some 175,000 collateralized customer accounts ranging from Institutional Investors & locals down to individuals.  We have put these into 2 buckets which have different profiles.  Phase 1 would include the Top 2000 accounts which are largely substantial institutional investors, locals, and high net worth individuals.  If this proves successful, phase 2 would be rolled out with products designed to attract activity from the smaller investors.  The idea would be to automate the products as much as is practical.
Mark Tayor in Legal has already spoken with their counsel and is comfortable that they have reviewed all the legal angles thoroughly.  Refco advises that if the have accounts back up by collateral guaranteed by them, they become Eligible Contract Participants (ECPs) able to execute derivatives.  So, they believe that the majority of the 175,000 accounts they have could be ECPs for the purposes of this deal.  Credit is reviewing the Refco financials and we plan to discuss this thoroughly during their visit.
Please do not hesitate to contact me at x36413 if you have any questions or comments and I will be getting in touch with you early next week to get your feedback.
Regards

Hal, as per our discussion here are the Logistics people that will be
dedicated to the ENom development:

Key subject experts:

The Logistics managers for each of the various regions will be the key
subject expert and will pull in the added resources (individual pipeline
schedulers) for the really detailed work. As far as time dedicated we will
commit to as much time as needed with the understanding that these
individuals do have the responsibility for managing all of the scheduling
activity in their regions. Bottom line is during bid-week and when
emergencies develop they will be needed at their trading desks. All meetings
with these individuals should be scheduled for the afternoon.

Kathy Kelly - Northeast
Ed Terry - Southeast
Randy Gay - West
George Smith - Central
Darren Farmer - Texas


Project Steering Team:

Bob Superty
Randy Gay
George Smith

As discussed we might have to bring in others when the product starts to take
shape and is impacting other areas (Global for example)


I look forward to our next meeting, thanks - Bob x30957

Hi there,
I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.
Here are some questions/comments:
I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations.
I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what
rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role of
the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that
familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll work
on it.
I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially
similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.
Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.
I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.
I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by the
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audited
financials, but I didn't comment there.
I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to
own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added
"construct", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.
Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):
Except for as described in Section ___ [ next paragraph], neither Party shall
assign any or all of their duties or rights under this Contract without prior
written consent from the other Party; such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing:  (i) either Party [Agent, too?] may assign any
or all of its duties or rights to any Affiliate or subsidiary without the
other Party,s consent; (ii) Purchaser may assign any or all of its duties or
rights to any Affiliate of Enron Corp., without Seller,s consent, [provided
that such assignee shall construct, own or operate the [Units] for the
purpose of generating electric power for revenue], and (iii) Purchaser may
assign any or all of its rights and obligations without Seller,s consent
following [delivery/substantial completion?].  In each instance the
assignment shall be effective as of the time the assignor delivers notice to
the other party in accordance with [Section ]. [form to be agreed now?]
Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its consent if
the proposed assignee: (i) does not have [a credit rating of ___]
[substantially the same or better credit quality than Agent] unless (a) the
proposed assignee provides appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other
assurances of payment issued by an entity or person with [a credit rating of
___] [substantially the same or better credit quality than Agent], or (b) the
assignor agrees to remain liable for all liability under this Agreement until
[delivery/substantial completion], or (c) is a party participating in or
providing financing or financing structures, including, without limitation,
structures related to leasing arrangements and project financing, including a
special purpose vehicle receiving financing to develop and/or construct the
project for which Purchaser [or Agent] purchased the Equipment [add
requirement of  delivery of  &rep letter8 from Enron regarding financing
sufficiency], or (d) final payment (except for the retention amount) has been
made to Seller;  (ii) is a direct competitor of Seller in the turbine
manufacturing business, (iii) is an adverse party to Seller in any material
litigation, or (iv) if purchasing the Equipment, such assignee is not
purchasing such Equipment (or rights thereto) as part of a transaction in
which Purchaser, Agent or their Affiliates is providing related goods and/or
services to such assignee.
Purchaser or Agent shall have the right to assign or pledge, from time to
time, all or any portion of their respective right, title and interest in, to
and under the Agreement as collateral for financing of this Facility without
Seller,s consent.
In the instances where consent is required, the party requesting consent
shall request such consent in writing, including the following:
(a) the legal name and address and the form and place of incorporation or
organization of the proposed assignee;
(b) the current published annual report of the proposed assignee, or if no
such report is published three years of audited financial statements and a
description of the proposed assignee,s business, if available; and
(c) [a descriptive list of power generation projects completed by the
assignee during the preceding five years].
Seller shall respond to any request for consent within thirty (30) days
following its receipt of such request.   Seller,s consent if granted shall be
in the form of Appendix __ hereto.  Any failure to respond in writing within
the foregoing period shall be deemed to constitute consent.
When duly assigned in accordance with this Article, (including, following any
collateral assignment, upon foreclosure by any collateral assignee), (i) this
Agreement or the rights and/or obligations so assigned shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the assignee (and all rights and/or
obligations so assigned, including, without limitation, any and all warranty
rights, shall be assigned to the assignee as if such assignee were an
original party hereto), (ii) the assignor shall be irrevocably relieved of
and forever discharged from all liability under this Agreement so long as the
assignee executes an assumption of this Agreement and such liabilities and
obligations herein, and (iii) Seller shall look only to such assignee for the
performance of the obligations so assigned.  Any assignment other than as
permitted herein shall be void and without force or effect.

Rick and Lynn,
I just wanted to give you an official memo that the NNG Flowing Gas Documents are now online with both the Reservation, Commodity, Variance and Imbalance invoices and their supporting documents.  NNG Customers are able to view both the Aug and Sep 2001 accounting month reports.  The customer can also view the 5 original Flowing Gas documents (Contract Imbalance, Shipper Imbalance, Invoices (Reservation and Commodity only), Allocation, and Measurement Information) from May 2000 to Aug 2001 accounting months via a hyperlink to Actuate.
During the next couple of months, I will still be working with the NNG reps and customers on various issues regarding the Flowing Gas reports: for instance, researching why the customer cannot access certain documents.   I will also be meeting with Legale and IT weekly on enhancements to Flowing Gas that are needed.
See me if you have questions.

Last week, Sue and I, along with Phil O'Connor of New Energy met with Frank
Clark ( Senior V.P. Exelon - Government Affairs, etc) and Arlene Juracek
(V.P. Rates and Tariffs).  Sue and I also met with Commissioners Hurley and
Harvill.
Information Gleaned From the Meeting:
1.  Com Ed does not think price volatility will be acceptable to the
residential customers and wants to create a structured rate.  They are not
open to any alternative that causes them to lose money.
2.  They will file a rate case in 2004 to be effective in 2005.  They are not
sure the statute requires them to file an MVI plus 10% at the end of the PPO
period and need to study the statutory requirements.  Their preference is to
initiate performanced based ratemaking instead for bundled rates.
3.  Com Ed's view is that the energy situation is a  national problem.  Com
Ed wants to be protected through its commodity price.
4.  Com Ed does not want the obligation to serve industrial customers and on
a longer term basis, would like to shed its obligation to serve residential.
5.  Com Ed has arbitrarily defined mass market as 400kw or less and has
therefore lumped these commercial customers in with their residential,
however, they are open to separating them out.
6.  Com Ed does not want the legislation reopened which may provide us with
some leverage.
At the conclusion of the meeting it was decided to start an open forum
process to get ideas on the table.  Com Ed is shying away from any formal
process.  Their concern seems to be that they do not want to take the
political heat for high prices and volatility and would rather give up its
default customer service obligations.
Possible Deal Opportunities:
1.  Either through negotiations (preferred choice) or through competitive
bidding, become the default service provider for some or all of Com Ed's
industrial customers.  This would allow us to upsell additional products to
the industrial class.
2.  Segregate the commercial customers (100 - 400 Kw) customers from the
residential customers and negotiate to become the default service provider.
3.  Joint venture between ENA and New Power to be the default service
provider for portions of the residential class through an opt-out program
like municipal aggregation or some other format.
Next Steps:
1.  Mark Ulrich is to complete an analysis of the Com Ed proposal in terms of
its impact on our current book of business
2.   Develop a position boiled down to just a few key points that we can push
with regulators and Com Ed.  In a conference call with Harry, Mark, Roy, Sue
and me, we have tentatively distilled the list to the following:
a.  Default deal for industrial customers
b.  Negotiate for Com Ed to provide load following and balancing
c.  Default deal for commercial as opposed to PBR

Hello, everyone.  I'm hoping you know of someone who would be a good fit for an interesting opportunity in Market Risk Management in RAC:
We're looking for a director level accountant or risk management operations person who can join the Strategic Risk Management (SRM) group within Market Risk Management to work on the Asset/Liability piece of Enterprise Risk Management project as we team up with Vince Kaminski's Research group on this challenging new initiative.
The ideal candidate would have Enron experience and be a good project manager, accustomed to working in self-directed situations, able to work with and gain the team support of  mid and upper level management in  research, accounting, risk management operations, finance, treasury, RAC, the business units, etc..  They would need to be able to articulate for top support and commercial management any project issues and implementation challenges, and would be working with risk mgmt operations and the business units on the implementation efforts and process design.  Someone able to take full responsibility for this long term project from its infancy through completion, designing a plan of attack, and then leading the implementation effort.  This person might also act as a consultant for SRM's other initiatives that impact accounting.  Ideally, of course, this person would understand risk management (risk books, trading operations, etc.), but someone who understands the different types of risks inherent in our strategic assets and accrual accounting contracts might also be a good fit if they're self-motivated and willing to dig in and learn the risk management business.
I think it's a great opportunity for someone to broaden their resume and gain market risk management expertise.  We've met with top risk management consultants, and this is a cutting edge initiative that will put us head and shoulders above our peers.
If you want to forward this to potential candidates, below are some links to websites that may provide some overview information on asset-liability / EW risk management (I haven't reviewed the sites myself yet).  Also, Vince's outline on Enterprise Risk Management from early last year is attached below.
Please call me if you know of someone who might be interested.
Thanks for your help,
Cassandra.

Following are responses to your questions on the truck deliveries to the H.D. King Power plant location (Fort Pierce).  We have answers to all questions except the quality specifications of the fuel oil.  We expect an answer on the quality specs tomorrow from our engineers (they are determining whether the air permit or the turbine requirements will be the primary driver of our quality specs).  We will forward them as soon as we receive these from the engineers.

How long will it take to get a notional price on filling the 200,000 gallon order?

Charlie and I will call later today to confirm your receipt of this email and to review any additional questions.  Please call me at x36751 or Charlie at x57229 with any questions.

Thanks

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


1) Do the delivering trucks need to have their own pumps?

The delivering trucks will require pumps.

2) What size lines are the trucks pumping into? 3"?

The line is 3"


3) When connecting to our lines do the trucks need anything other than standard fittings?

Standard fittings may be used or 3 inch quick disconnect fittings.


4) Full spec sheet--especially sodium and potassium guarantees

The environmental specs are known but the specs on the turbine itself from Mitsubishi (MHI) are not known.  We cannot determine the final specs unitl the MHI requirements are known.

5) After the initial tank fill delivery availability 24 hours/day and weekends?

Someone is always on duty at plant so deliveries can technically be made on a 24/7 basis.  The plant manager did say he would like to avoid a long line of trucks out the plant in order to maintain good relationships with the neighbors.


6) Tank fill and beyond--why not the full 1MM gallons?

At this point we are only replacing the 200,000 gallons of oil we had Fort Pierce burn in order to empty their old tank and allow us to clear that location for our plant.  Additional oil may be purchased later (next year) after development plans are further along.


7) Dyed/non dyed fuel issue--tax evaluating

The plant requires non-Dyed fuel.


8) Identify previous diesel supplier to the plant

Coastal was the previous supplier to the plant.


9) Design a fuel resupply plan including pre-purchase of fuel, call on transportation, buy diesel calls for expected outage periods

Such a plan appears to be premature at this point but we will review the issues with you at a later date.

10) Buyer of record and credit issues with suppliers

Fort Pierce Utilities Authority is the buyer of record.

11) Tank fill price--fixed or floating? (Platt's, NYMEX, OPIS, rack price)

We are looking for a firm fixed price bid for filling the tank, unless you would recommend otherwise.

12) Commercial start date of plan

The tank will be finished and available for fill on 5/15/2001.

13) Any other issue to be discussed

None that we are aware of.

Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply
"to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ..."
I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to
either
1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act,
or
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer
classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing
requirements.
The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who
have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE
customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can
give you some specific language.)
Hedy or Scott - could you please call me when you get in - 713 853-5786.
Thanks.

California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks

California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for
Davis.
"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get
us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday.
"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach
a compromise.
"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told
reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I
may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy.
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility,
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn,
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for
all sides, is closed to the public and media.
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the
parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report
confirmed by sources close to the talks.
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said.
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have
to pay for energy under those deals.
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at
volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so
did the state's electricity bills.
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years.
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy
analysts say.
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count
as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress,"
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.
"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable"
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight
committee for the California grid.
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room
"billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend,
sources said.

Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes

Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run
around FERC's Order 637,
filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff
procedures to avoid the
more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer
protests.

Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories,
Indicated Shippers said. They include
imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality,
point allocations, curtailment
priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental
purchase and sale, capacity release,
unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous.

Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of
KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316),
saying "most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI
to implement elements of
Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity
for meaningful review and
comment by KMI's customers." Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and
comment on usually routine
tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted
30 days for comments on
Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to
make compliance filings June 15.

KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed
at changing its tariff to reflect "the
current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.." It
did acknowledge, "A number of the
changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's
goals in Order No. 637."

Indicated Shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding
negative storage imbalances
and end of season inventory swaps a matter of KMI's discretion without any
standards on how those decisions
would be made. The shippers also protested changes to the default methodology
for point allocations for billing
purposes, and the injection of KMI discretion into the formula for accepting
or rejecting predetermined allocation
agreements with upstream or downstream parties. In addition curtailment
provisions filed by KMI appear to be
contrary to Order 637-A's mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary
path should have primary rights.

The filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up
significant quantities of coal bed methane gas
in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on
nitrogen content, according to
Western Gas Resources. A key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality
specification of 3% by volume.
While KMI states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with
interconnecting pipelines, six of the
seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications. Only
KMI's affiliate, Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America, has similar rules, Western Gas said.

"KMI's proposed nitrogen specification would enable KMI to refuse to accept
coal bed methane production for
transportation, thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal
means of downstream pipeline egress
out of Powder River production areas," Western Gas added. Producers would
have to shut in production while
they construct costly nitrogen facilities. This could "create at least a
temporary gap in the downstream
movement of coal bed supplies to mid-continent and eastern markets, thus
frustrating consumer access to
these significant supplies."

Mary,
As in my email below to Daren, we are seeing some OA variances between flash to actual on the PLE contracts on PGEV for 10/00-12/00.  I have verified with Thu Nguyen of what the statements from PGEV show and that is also what we have booked in Unify and recorded to the G/L as an imbalance.  However, when looking in CPR (under CPR Pipeline Exchange), there was not anything flashed for those months, thus our OA variance.  I seem to remember that Stacy once said that although we may run an imbalance at the end of a month on occassion, in those few times that we do, 1)it should be relatively small and 2) in the following days of the next month, we should have worked the imbalance down to zero thus having no imbalance at the end of the month.  In a voice mail from Daren today, he seemed to think the same thing was happening or even that by the end of each month, we were balanced to zero.  Can you shed some light on these months and let me know if we should have had an imbalance and if we should have, why there would have not been anything flashed.  If we should not have had an imbalance, then we'll need your help to figure out what went wrong in that PGEV shows an imbalance on their statements.  Let me know what you think.........

Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San
Francisco.  He thought that one day would be more that adequate.  I need to
have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week.
Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end
with our legal contacting their legal?

Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was
the following:

PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the
gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a
customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry
of the unknown)

Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing

Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal

Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage
their PCBs

Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental
impacts have occurred

Murray,  Thanks for the info, and the ideas.  We will talk on Monday when you get into the office.

Terry, Evan and Mark,

I am trying to determine if EES customers have been invoiced in compliance with the contract anywhere there is language regarding consumption bands/ over/under takes.  There is at least one thought throughout the organization that penalties have never been invoiced if a customer's usage was outside of the contractual bands, such as 90/110.

Beth and I talked with CSC about this last week, and they told us the following.

Gas:
The Altra system handles the over-take (above 110) as another tier in the pricing to bill the penalties.  The invoice combines it into one line-item with the first tier so when it is booked to the general ledger it is not segregated.  They do provide the customer with a break-out independently.  For undertakes, the administration is manual.  Erich Evans, CSC Gas Supervisor, told us he was confident in that his staff is monitoring the bands and applying penalties as applicable.  He did tell us that in the past the Gas Desk has communicated to CSC that they did not want the penalties accessed for the undertakes.  He also said that customers have a tendancy to dispute the undertake penalties.

In the HP abd STAT systems, the efforts are also manual.  Once again, he is confident that his staff is administering the penalties.

The exception to this is two-fold.  First of all, when CSC acquired these systems and contracts (formerly the Enron Dublin/Access Energy deals) from EES in 1999, there was no review of the contracts to ensure the system had cpatured the terms correctly.  CSC simply continued to invoice as EES had.  For new deals entered into from their take-over in 1999, CSC actually received the contracts and interpreted them to capture the data in their systems.  This practice continued until 2001 when the "deal ticket" concept was introduced, pushing the burden to EES for the correct data capture.  The process was gradual, but CSC feels that by 5/01 that almost 100% of the deals were captured through the deal ticket process.  Therefore, there is exposure that the deal set-up within CSC's systems is not accurate and consequently, the bands are not being monitored for compliance.

Second, since the deal ticket process was effective, CSC's administration of bands is reliant on communications from EES through the deal ticket.

In either scenario, our deal clean-up team will reveal any inaccurate deals, and our historical clean-up team will be able to calculate the exposures.  CSC is providing a listing of billed penalties/disputed penalties by Friday, 8/10.

POWER:
CSC is aware of only one contract with this scenario.

We do not believe this to be true, and need to locate some power contracts to follow through their systems.  I need your help with this.

Terry,  Can someone on the Phoenix team provide me with a listing of any contracts that the team has looked at with this contractual implications?

Evan,  Can your service managers also provide examples of contracts that they know have the contract language?

Mark,  As we discussed on Friday, I need your team to review the GNO contracts/invoices and let me know if they are monitoring this.

Please let me know ASAP on Monday when I can expect this info.  I will assign someone tomorrow to bird-dog this for me.  I need an answer, and a plan (if it is not being monitored) by Tuesday to determine EES's exposure.

I appreciate your help.

I would have responded sooner, but I was on the 9:30 EWS conference call.
I am planning to go.  I'm pretty sure Jane Tholt, who trades El Paso on the West gas desk, will go.  Suzanne Calcagno has also indicated an interest so she may go as well.
Jane's major concern at this time is that El Paso doesn't mess with the pooling procedures.  Their proposal calls for increasing the number of pools on the system from the current six to twenty, which the Desk feels would impair liquidity.
I wouldn't look for a lot of progress at this conference.  The EOC full-requirements customers are going to be howling about having their flexibility restricted in any way, and the other firm customers who have CD limits are going to howl about the full requirements customers having a secondary priority superior to theirs.  This same proposal was on the table and they couldn't reach a compromise in six months of settlement conferences working with the chief FERC ADR person on the Amoco/Burlington complaint case.  Our preference is with the CD customers' position, but if the full requirements customers don't get some kind of accommodation, they will never settle.  Then if FERC rules against them, they will take it to the appeals court and maybe further.  This is a BIG issue for them.

Jerry, I received a copy of an email you addressed to Bill Brown regarding a conversation you had with Karen Choyce about who is responsible for Unclaimed Property Reporting to the States.  The Corporate Secretary Division centralized this function a few years ago and I am the person responsible for making sure that Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries stay in compliance.

I think Karen meant that it is the responsibility of each business unit to identify the unclaimed checks, move the funds to the Escheat Liability Account, communicate this information to the Corporate Secretary's Division, and reconcile the general ledger as it pertains to their business unit.

It is my responsibility to prepare the reports and remit the funds to the applicable state before the deadline.  Please forward any correspondence you receive from the States regarding this matter (including notices and forms) to my attention for further handling.  Thank you for your cooperation.

Just a reminder - timesheets need to be approved by 10:00 A.M. on Tuesday,
February 15.  This is necessary in order to meet the Payroll deadline of
exporting time to ETA (the Corporate payroll system), which is NOON on
Wednesday, February 16.  Any timesheets that are not approved by the 10:00
Tuesday deadline will automatically be approved by the Energy Operations
Timesheet Coordinator.

FYI - For the payroll period ending 1/31, there was only 1 timesheet
outstanding at the established deadline.  In the past, there have been as
many as 100 (which represents a little more than 25% of the Energy Operations
headcount).  Thanks for your help and support.  I know that the Assistants
all appreciate your help in meeting this deadline.

A lot of you may not be affected by Project Hurricane.  If you don't know
anything about it, then you probably aren't affected by it!  In any event, we
have set up 2 new E-work orders in the Org Database for Project Hurricane.
They are as follows:

E-HURR (should be used to capture all time spent on the ongoing support for
Project Hurricane)
E-HSET (should be used to capture all set-up costs)

Both of these work orders are set up and can be used for the 2/15 pay
period.  However, the following steps must be taken for your employees to use
the ATES system and code their time to these work orders:

MANAGERS - Identify employees within your RC that will need to charge time to
either or both of these work orders.  Please let your Assistants know who
these employees are.
ASSISTANTS - Based on the information you receive from your managers, you
must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee's profile in the Org
Database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ATES.
ASSISTANTS - For each Time Site you are responsible for, you must be sure to
add this information to ETA.  If you aren't sure how to handle this, please
contact Kim Perkins ASAP at x3-5304.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in getting timesheets processed in
a timely manner.  Please be sure to share this information with your staff if
you haven't already done so.  If you have any questions on the timesheets or
the work orders, please contact me at x3-6343.

At our last meeting, we identified several impediments to participating in
the aggregation programs in Northeast Ohio.  They included the uncertainty of
the shopping credit and the requirement for load following on 500-600
megawatts of capacity in Cleveland and possibly 2000 megawatts in Norheast
Ohio, where we have no generating capacity and no pool exists.  At the
conclusion of the meeting, we decided to try and find out if there are other
serious non-Ohio affiliated bidders out there before we took more aggressive
measures on why municipal aggregation doesn't work.

I have spoken to George Pofok at Cleveland Public Power who stated that he
has spoken to 12 power marketers and 1 power broker.  He has received a
number of bids below the shopping credit from suppliers who are both
affiliates and nonaffiliates.  He said that about three or four of the
bidders have voiced concerns about getting firm transmission service into
FE.  (Once the power reaches FE, under the Ohio settlement, they will treat
it like their own native load).  An equal number of marketers have also
expressed concern about the load following issue. Pofok's view is that
without generation in the region, it will be difficult to play in this
market.  He noted that in 3-4 years, Orion will be a major player once the
buy-back is completed.  Further, he believes that the problem is not as much
one of insufficient generation as it is of insufficient transmission and that
"paper solutions" will not solve the problem.  Jeff and I will be meeting
with him to discuss transmission issues.  (Pofok is also Chairman of the
Board of Amp-Oh).

Our competitors who are proposing/building capacity in Ohio include:
Cogentrix, Dominion, DPL Energy, Dresden, Duke, Entergy, Ohio National Energy
and  PG&E National Energy Group.

With regard to aggregation in FE service territory, I see three options which
are as follows:

1.  Do not compete in that market for aggregated load
2.  Reconsider building generating capacity in the FE service territory
3.  Bid on aggregation and take the risk for balancing or sign a network
operating agreement

With respect to the third option, preliminarily, it appears that under FE's
regs, if you don't have power within a control area's control, you have to
sign a network agreement.  I am in the process of obtaining that agreement to
see if that gets us over the hurdle, since if we signed the network
agreement, we would not have to worry about load following, (depending of
course on the price).  Point to point is only available to retail customers
taking service at 69 kv and above.

The other point with regard to balancing is that under the FE settlement, as
long as the system is balanced within 88 MW, there is no penalty,  A payment
of the cost to the utility would be required if the system was out of balance
by more than 88MW (based on FE's L-sub 10 limit) and our contribution to the
system was in the same direction as the imbalance.  Cash out is at market
price  with no penalties.  Market price is calculated as the incremental cost
to FE to buy the power if we are short or the sale price if we are long.
Penalties attach if there is a pattern of frequently being out of balance.
Under the FE agreement, we would schedule a day ahead but could change that
schedule up to twenty minutes before each hour which should help manage the
risk of getting into an imbalance situation.  This is very close to how we
managed the deal we did behind Duquesne.

One other issue I am looking into is ancillary services.  It appears in the
Alliance RTO filing that the intention is to require suppliers to pay for
ancillary services associated with retail services whereas the utilities
would not.  In the FE supplier tariffs, it indicates we must pay for
transmission and ancillaries, but in the retail tariffs unbundling service,
the transmission and ancillary charges are broken out and appear to be
included in the cost the customer pays the utility (minus the shopping
credit).  I asked Rick Hornsby of Tabors and Associates to look at this to
see if there is a double counting or an argument that could be made to keep
suppliers and customers from paying the same charge twice.  He concurred that
there appears to be a double counting.  I have written up an argument on this
which is being included in a pleading we are filing today and am also talking
to staffers about it.  This would improve the economics of any aggregation
deal we might do.

As soon as I get the network agreement, I will let you know.  Please let me
know your thoughts about how we ought to proceed.

Federal price limits backfire
Some generators withhold power rather than abide by rate caps
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer
Wednesday, July 4, 2001

N186091.DTL
Officials in California and Nevada, after months of lobbying for federal
regulators to cap Western power prices, warned yesterday that the newly
imposed limits have had the unintended consequence of increasing a threat of
blackouts in the two states.
The warnings were issued as California came within minutes of rolling
blackouts yesterday afternoon, and one day after the first-ever rolling
blackouts in Las Vegas forced energy-hungry casinos to shut off fountains and
reduce air conditioning.
The two states are asking the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to take a
closer look at the so-called price mitigation plan and come up with revisions
that would deter power companies from withholding electricity during
shortages.
"We need some clarity to this order," said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the
California Department of Water Resources, which is spending billions of
dollars to keep the state's lights on.
"Generators need to be held accountable," he said.
The crux of the problem is that price limits kick in during shortages, yet
power companies say these caps force them to sell power at below-market rates
during periods of high demand.
Some companies have responded by holding back power rather than face the
expense of shipping electricity from state to state. Each mile that
electricity must be transmitted adds to the overall cost.
"No one's going to pay for transmission if the cost is near the caps," said
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, an
energy-industry association in Menlo Park.
Ackerman said several companies in his organization decided that there was no
economic advantage to offering power in regional markets when price controls
are in effect.
"This means individual regions like California or Las Vegas could end up not
having enough," Ackerman said. "It increases the threat of blackouts."
BLACKOUT ALERT CANCELED
California authorities issued a blackout alert at 1:45 p.m. yesterday when
power reserves dipped to dangerously low levels. They canceled the alert
about an hour later, after finding additional supplies.
"Everyone in the West is fighting for megawatts," said Stephanie McCorkle, a
spokeswoman for the California Independent System Operator, which oversees
the state's power network.
The Golden State's latest brush with lights-out conditions came a day after
Nevada experienced its own rolling blackouts for the first time, prompting
heavy power users such as the MGM Grand and Caesars Palace to dim their
lights.
Don Soderberg, chairman of the Nevada Public Utilities Commission, said that
the sudden power emergency took state authorities by surprise and that they
are investigating to see what role the federal price limits may have had in
exacerbating Monday's shortage.
"We're looking very closely at this," he said. "There seems to be a potential
for unintended consequences."
Specifically, Soderberg said Nevada is focusing on operators of older, less-
efficient plants who would find profit margins shrinking, if not vanishing,
under capped prices.
"We're going to see how the caps might have played into this," he said.
The federal ceiling in 10 Western states, excluding California, is about $92
per megawatt hour. In California, a 10 percent surcharge is added because of
the state's credit risk, bringing the price to just over $101.
Ackerman at the Western Power Trading Forum said regional price controls have
extended California's power crisis to neighboring states.
"California sneezed and the rest of the region caught the virus," he said.
'LAWYERS LOOKING FOR LOOPHOLES'
California and Nevada officials, however, said that they still have faith
that price limits can stabilize Western electricity markets but that federal
regulators may have to tweak the system so that power companies cannot
withhold output.
"The generators have banks of lawyers looking for loopholes (in the plan),"
said Hidalgo at the Department of Water Resources.
Unfortunately, it may take some time for the regulators to revisit an issue
that they took up only with the greatest reluctance. For months, federal
regulators refused to impose price controls, preferring instead to let supply
and demand determine costs.
Hidalgo said that when it appeared that power companies were throttling back
on output Monday, California officials immediately dialed the hot line number
provided by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in case of emergencies.
"No one answered," he said. "They were closed."
State officials tried again yesterday, and this time were told that the
commission would look into the matter. They were not given a time frame for
when the commission might come up with a response.

Out-of-state generators pull plug over uncertainty on price controls
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 3, 2001)
Confused by the federal government's new controls on electricity prices,
generators withheld so much power from California on Monday that the state
was nearly plunged into rolling blackouts, state officials said.
The confusion began when the state's electric grid operators declared a Stage
1 power alert in the early afternoon, triggering the price caps for the first
time since they went into effect June 21.
Out-of-state generators pulled about 1,500 megawatts of electricity off the
table at midafternoon, enough to power about 1.1 million homes, because of
uncertainty about how much they could charge under the new Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission pricing system, said Oscar Hidalgo, spokesperson for
the state Department of Water Resources. The department buys electricity for
the state's financially distressed utilities.
"They didn't understand what they were going to be paid; there was confusion
over the FERC order," Hidalgo said. "We saw 1,500 megawatts disappear."
The problem was exacerbated by a heat wave across the West, which forced
California to compete with other states for scarce electricity, he said.
Rolling blackouts hit southern Nevada.
Most California officials credit the FERC system, which is based on a
variable price cap, with reining in what had been a runaway wholesale power
market. But power generators have complained that the price caps, by limiting
profits, could discourage the production of critically needed electricity.
And as Monday's episode suggested, even the uncertainty about where the cap
will fall could lead to unexpected shortages.
"That's the risk that you run (with price controls)," said Arthur O'Donnell,
editor of the newsletter California Energy Markets. "People want any kind of
certainty at all."
Hidalgo said the state avoided blackouts only because of last-minute imports
from the Bonne'ville Power Administration, the federal agency that markets
government-produced hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest. The state
went into a Stage 2 power alert, the next-to-last level before blackouts are
ordered. The alert was canceled in late afternoon.
The blackouts would have been the first in California since May 8.
FERC imposed a round-the-clock ceiling on power throughout the West. The
price fluctuates and is tied to the production costs of the least-efficient
plant operating in California during a "power alert" declared by the
Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power-transmission grid.
When there's no alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the cap that was
established during the latest alert.
Until Monday, the maximum price held steady at about $101 a megawatt-hour in
California. But when the ISO declared a Stage 1 power alert in early
afternoon, signifying that reserve supplies had dwindled to less than 7
percent of demand, confusion set in, Hidalgo and others said.
Because of a steep drop in the price of natural gas, which fuels many
California power plants, suppliers knew the cap would fall. But no one knew
by how much until the price was posted by the ISO.
The ceiling for California fell to about $77 at 3 p.m. but was back up to $98
in two hours, according to the ISO. Those prices include the 10 percent
premium that sellers can charge California because FERC said there's a credit
risk in selling to the state.
O'Donnell said it's likely suppliers will pull back from the market every
time the ISO declares a power alert.
In-state generators have to operate their plants if summoned by the ISO. But
out-of-state suppliers can withhold supplies, and on Monday it was the
out-of-staters that were pulling back, Hidalgo said.

Power Sales Halted by New Pricing Curbs
Electricity: Confused suppliers, unsure what they will be paid, refuse to
sell to state, which asks FERC for a ruling but doesn't get it.
By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer
SACRAMENTO--Confusion over new federal price restrictions prompted
several electricity sellers to back away from sales to California on Monday
afternoon, pushing the state closer to blackouts, energy officials said.
The state lost sales that would have provided enough electricity to
supply more than 1 million homes, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the
California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying much of the
state's electricity since January.
At least five companies producing or marketing power "are telling us
that since they don't know what they're going to get paid, they're not going
to take the risk, and so they're not going to sell the energy," Hart said.
The electricity sales fell through after power consumption soared in
summer heat and grid operators were forced to declare a Stage 1 emergency,
meaning reserves had dipped below 7%. It was the first such emergency since
May 31.
Under a June 19 order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
intended to bring down wholesale electricity markets across the West, a power
emergency in California triggers the setting of a new price limit that
applies to power plant owners from Washington to Arizona.
The new price is supposed to be based upon whatever it costs to run the
most inefficient, expensive power plant selling electricity to California
grid operators during the first full hour of a Stage 1 emergency.
But much uncertainty remains about exactly how and when the new price is
supposed to be established under the commission's order, and that apparently
drove away sellers, Hart said.
Shortly after the state issued the Stage 1 alert at 1:30 p.m., putting
the old price limit of $90 per megawatt-hour in question, companies that had
committed to provide the state electricity hour by hour Monday afternoon
backed out, Hart said. The companies include TransAlta Energy Marketing of
Oregon, Constellation Power of Baltimore and Sempra Energy Trading, a unit of
the San Diego-based energy conglomerate.
Forced to dip even deeper into the state's power reserves and declare a
Stage 2 emergency, water agency officials called the federal energy
commission's hotline for clarification about what the new price should be and
when it should take effect. They got no answer.
Hart said commission officials reached at home promised to try to
clarify their order today. One outstanding question is what obligations power
suppliers have to deliver electricity to California in an emergency.
Both buyers and sellers in the market agree that the new price, when it
is set, will probably be lower than $90 per megawatt-hour because the price
of natural gas, the main fuel in California power plants, has dropped lately.
Temperatures soared several degrees higher Monday than grid operators
had anticipated. But they said they expected to avoid rolling blackouts in
part because the Bonneville Power Administration in Portland, Ore., had
agreed to provide several hundred megawatts of Pacific Northwest hydropower
each hour in exchange for a return of electricity from California later this
summer.
"Bonneville is giving us emergency power to get us through," Hart said.

Jeff:

I was the person who asked the question " What are your metrics for becoming the World's Leading Company" today in the EES floor meeting.
I appreciate your answer, and hope together we all can make it become a reality.

I also have been the Macerich Account Manager since contract inception-- and wanted to convey to you the  appreciation and thanks that their
senior managers expressed to me last week when I provided Macerich with a 6 month update of our  deal.

They asked me to tell you ( and Angela )  that your attendance at their conference was a "huge hit " with employees.  In addition. many of their employees have told them your presentation was  extremely compelling and that many of their employees have used the presentation you gave to think about new ways that they can "innovate" and "create value" for Macerich in their daily operations.

Thought you would like to know.

Uneven Progress
Asia Risk - November 2000
By Quentin Hills

The derivatives markets across Asia continue to develop in terms of maturity
and complexity.  However, as has been the case over the past five years,
this development has been neither homogeneous or consistent. Before
considering the future landscape, it is worth reviewing the various phases
of the market during the last few years.

During the early to mid 1990s, the main activity comprised currency and
interest rate transactions in the major currencies. The market was dominated
by a handful of foreign financial institutions, while local currency
business was limited and activity was for the most part evenly distributed
throughout the region. The regulatory environment was mixed and generally
not well defined or comprehensive.  Increasingly during this period, the
transactions became more speculative (in line with global trends)and the
inevitable occurred in the first quarter of 1994. As interest rates quickly
reversed (de, rose) in February 1994, there were several well-publicised
losses both in the region and globally. There were quick and adverse
consequences on the derivatives markets.

Activity abruptly slowed, speculative transactions ceased and financial
institutions that had been active pulled back - at least temporarily.
Globally, the focus turned towards discipline and control and there was a
flurry of new derivatives guidelines and regulations. Asian regulators
responded with new guidelines, which largely followed international
practice. During this period the industry, represented by the International
Swaps and Derivatives Association and regulators from all countries,
developed strong relationships.  These relationships continue to this day
and result in increasing industry comments during the drafting of new
regulations.

As derivatives markets began to recover, players returned and new entrants
emerged, local currency markets developed strongly and end-users focused on
risk management processes.  Nevertheless, despite the lack of highly
leveraged    structures, companies throughout the region continued to fund
long-term local currency investments with shorter term foreign currency
("cheaper") liabilities, both in the cash markets and synthetic derivatives.
When the Asian Crisis struck, the impact was severe and the toll heavy.
Apart from deals being unwound, activity ceased and liquidity disappeared.

Since the crisis, derivatives markets have recovered with a marked increase
in activity (although not to pre-crisis levels), the return of market makers
and the introduction of new products, such as credit derivatives.

Going forward, the market seems poised to resume strong growth as Asia
emerges from this difficult period.

Breadth and depth of participants

A consequence of the crisis was a sharp and significant fall in counterparty
creditworthiness across the region and the withdrawal of many market makers.
This was particularly acute during the height of the crisis, but is
reversing as foreign banks once again become more active and local banks
build their derivatives capabilities. Corporate credit quality is slowly
improving and a recent trend has been the increasing use of derivatives by
financial institutions - particularly local banks and fund managers. This is
expected to continue as more active portfolio management leads to a focus on
yield enhancement and credit risk management.

Additionally, there has been an ongoing mend among end-users of markedly
improved understanding and use of derivatives in risk management. Also
noticeable is the broader application of new products. For example, local
financial institutions are using credit derivatives to manage balance sheet
risk strategically, both for liabilities and assets. This reflects the
efficiencies available through the correct use of derivatives and increasing
sophistication of end-users.

Domestic bond markets

The emergence of domestic bond markets is having a positive impact on market
development, both directly and indirectly. There is a direct impact where
bond issues are swapped into a different currency (in the case of foreign
issuers accessing a market), or interest rate (where issuers wish to alter
the interest rate basis).  Additionally, the increased availability of
instruments in the market and greater demand for product from investors is
leading to new local currency products, such as options on domestic interest
rates and securities.

Regulatory convergence

Finally, derivatives regulation in the region has generally been somewhat
mixed, with some countries adopting a prescriptive approach and others a
risk-based approach. Prior to the Asian Crisis, there was a trend towards
convergence and harmonization with respect to regulation. During the crisis,
however, new  regulatory initiatives were put on hold as countries managed
larger and more pressing issues.

The response to the economic turmoil elicited different responses concerning
currency convertibility. Naturally, where currency controls were imposed
either in part or in full, there was a direct adverse impact on the local
derivatives market. However, in those countries where the response has been
to keep markets open, or even to restructure the local financial markets,
derivatives usage has rebounded quickly. This in turn requires further
regulatory consideration, which has generally been in line with
international standards. Going forward, it is reasonable to expect a mend
towards regulatory harmonization and increasing adoption of international
regulatory standards.

The derivatives markets in Asia have undergone dramatic changes over the
last few years. The markets themselves are far from homogeneous and
significant progress has been made from a low base. There has been continual
progress as the number of users increases, more products become available
and regulations put in place to allow healthy market development.
Development has not been uniform across the region, nor has it been
consistent over time as evidenced by the setbacks brought about by the Asian
Crisis. Nevertheless, the derivatives markets in Asia will continue to
develop and mature as end-users grow in number and sophistication, while the
range of products continues to expand.

German Derivatives Legislation: A Need For Change Now
Derivatives Week - November 26, 2000

In a global economy it is essential that each country establish a
transparent and efficient regulatory system for financial products. To
ensure market stability, governments must also instill a high degree of
confidence m the legal system. In   relation to over-the-counter derivatives
transactions, these goals have not yet been fully achieved in Germany. But
with the forthcoming Fourth Financial Markets Enhancement Act
(4.Finanzmarktf~rderungsgesetz) there might be light at the end of the
tunnel. In this context, it makes sense to look at a much-needed change in
the legal regulation of the so called Borsentermingeschaft.

ENFORCEABILITY
Generally, a party to a derivatives contract under German law could attempt
to challenge the validity of the agreement by raising a statutory defense:
the gaming or betting defense (sec. 762 of the Civil Code, Burgerliches
Gesetzbuch), the margin defense (sec. 764 of the Civil Code), or the futures
defense (sec. 52 of the Exchange Act, Borsengesetz).  However, there are two
ways to possibly avoid the threat of such defenses: (i) the contract in
question could qualify as a hedging transaction, or (ii) as a so called
exchange traded futures agreement (Borsentermingeschaft).

HEDGING
Under the hedging exception, a derivatives transaction is valid,
enforceable, and not subject to the gaming, betting or margin defense either
if it constitutes a hedge for both parties or if the transaction is a hedge
for one party and if this party believes, without negligence, that the
transaction constitutes a hedge for the other party as well. The term hedge
in this context covers micro-hedging strategies. Whether this exception is
also true with respect to macro-hedging strategies is not entirely dear.
Modern legal authors tend not to use the term "hedging exception" anymore,
but more broadly refer to economically justified transactions.

BORSENTERMINGESCHAFTE
According to the Exchange Act (sec. 53 pare. 1) Borsentermingeschafte are
binding on both parties if each
party is a merchant, and is either registered or not subject to registration
because he/it is a foreign resident or a public law  entity, or a
professional (defined as a person who, at the time of the transaction or
prior thereto, traded in futures commercially or professionally, or is
permanently admitted to engage in exchange-trading).

If only one party qualifies under the relevant provision of the Exchange
Act, a futures transaction is enforceable only if one party is subject to
statutory banking or exchange supervision, be it in Germany or abroad, and
informs the other party in writing of the risks inherent in the derivatives
transactions in question
(standardized information papers which, pursuant to German Supreme Court
(Bundesterichtshof ) case law, satisfy the requirements under the Exchange
Act and were created by the industry federations of the German banks). This
technique of entering a valid agreement is commonly referred to as the
"information model" and is subject to strict and ongoing form requirements.

In addition, the transaction in question must qualify as a
Borsentermingeschaft. Unfortunately, this term has never been statutorily
defined, but is intended to cover new types of transactions and has, thus,
to be interpreted in a broad sense.  Moreover, the Exchange Act was amended
in 1989 to extend the privilege of its sec. 53 to transactions with a
similar financial purpose as exchange-traded futures transactions.
Therefore, today most types of financial, commodity, energy and credit
derivatives, whether stock exchange traded or OTC products, are generally
eligible for falling under sec. 53 of the Exchange Act. Despite the vast
amount of case law (almost exclusively in the context of warrants) on this
matter, there is still some uncertainty as to whether certain OTC
derivatives qualify as Borsenter7ningeschdffe within the meaning of this
provision.

RELIEF: THE FOURTH FINANCIAL MARKETS ENHANCEMENT ACT
It is, however, widely expected-or at least hoped - that the forthcoming
Fourth Financial Markets  Enhancement Act will include the introduction of a
statutory definition of Borsentermingeschafte.
A legislative initiative to define Borsentermingeschafte in concrete terms
would be helpful, not least because the German Supreme Court seems in its
more recent judgments to have entirely given up the attempt to bring such
transactions within its own traditional definition attempts and now lays
emphasis only on the financial purpose necessary for qualification as a
Borsentermingeschafte.

The term also requires clarification in light of recent amendments to the
Securities Trading Act (Wertpapierhandelsgesetz) and the Banking Act
(Kreditwesengesetz), implementing into German law the EC Investment Services
Directive (ISD) and the EC Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD), which
introduced the distinguishable supervisory law term "derivative," narrowly
defined, into the two acts.

The term "Borsentermingeschaft" is not used internationally - it is specific
to Germany. Its conceptual scope is controvasial3 and the continuous
development of new types of transactions requires a provision which is as
comprehensive as possible. For this reason, it makes sense to find a legal
definition which includes existing derivatives and can accommodate new
developments.

Moreover, the essential point of a derivative is the dependence of its price
upon the development of its underlying(s). Securities,  money-market
instruments, currencies, units of account, interest rates or other yields as
well as commodities, power, and precious metals may all be assets underlying
derivatives transactions as defined in, for example, the Securities Trading
Act and the Banking Act. In addition, the inclusion of other underlyings
such as credit events, weather developments, traffic flows and environmental
emissions would be desirable in order to ensure that here too validity
defenses are essentially eliminated.

A broad definition of a Borsentermingeschafte would remedy the existing lack
of public confidence in the law - especially with regard to future
developments-and thus would enhance the status of Finanzplatz Deutschland.
The German banking associations and the International Swaps and Derivatives
Association should be supported by all market participants in air attempts
to convince the German legislator to make a broad definition of
Borsentermingeschafte a reality as soon as possible.

Rate Derivatives Is Top Performer
Australian Financial Review - November 28, 2000
By Bill McConnell

An explosion in the use of interest rate derivatives, particularly forward
rate agreements and swaps has been the standout feature of Australian
financial markets this year alongside strong growth in non-government debt
securities.

However, a slump in foreign exchange transactions resulted in an overall
decline in total financial markets turnover.

The Australian Financial Markets Association, in conjunction with the
Securities Industry Research Centre of Asia-Pacific  released the results of
its annual report on trading in  Australian financial instruments yesterday.
The report detailed statistical results of Australian over-the-counter, and
exchange traded market activity.

Traded contracts in Australian financial instruments totaled $38.3 trillion
with the bulk of trading taking place on over-the-counter markets which
contributed 72 per cent of total market turnover.

The two markets to show substantial declines in trading activity were
foreign exchange and options on futures, with yearly volumes down 16.7 per
cent in FX markets and 26.1 per cent in SFE traded options. The fall in
activity in currency trading the first since 1994-95 led to an overall
decline in market turnover of 1.5 per cent.

The total turnover on the Australian Stock Exchange options and direct
equities was $466 billion, or a little over 1 percent of total market
volume. But the meager contribution provided by equity markets masked an
impressive 28 per cent increase on volumes from levels last year, and a 14
per cent increase in exchange traded options.

Market capitalisation in the Australian sharemarket also increased by 20 per
cent to $682 billion.

The report identified not only a growth in share trading, but also a
changing investor profile.

``This growth in investor participation in the market does not mean larger
volumes. It also means there is a growing number of more experienced
investors, seeking a broader range of investment products. In addition, the
growth in superannuation funds in Australia is placing greater demand on
investment                  products. The challenge for exchanges is to meet
these growing demands.''

But the top performer in Australian financial markets this year was interest
rate derivatives . Use of forward rate agreements more than doubled during
the year to $1 trillion making it the fastest growing market segment for the
year.  Non-government debt securities, repurchase agreements and swaps
experienced growth in turnover between 36 and 50 percent.

Swap turnover has increased every year since data was first collected in
1992-93.

``Turnover in swap markets has increased each year for four years, and that
has been happening irrelevant of economic circumstances,'' said Mr. Gordon
Axford, chairman of the Swaps Committee.

``This has been a function of greater use of capital markets, and an
increased borrowing requirement by the corporate sector requiring the use of
swaps to hedge exposure.''

Mr. Ken Farrow, chief executive officer of AFMA, said it had been ``an
astonishing turnaround'' by interest rate markets after FRA markets appeared
to be in decline in 1994.

``The interest rate market was more volatile this year than last and that
means there was greater underlying customer demand for interest rate
hedging,'' said Mr. Farrow.

Trading in government debt securities fell for the fourth consecutive year,
and while the traded volumes fell by only 1.1 per cent, the trend suggests a
creeping supply gap between government and corporate markets.

``Corporate issuance has really come into its own,'' said Mr. Phil Coates,
AFMA debt capital markets committee chairman.

``The market has advanced considerably. People are very much in tune with
what is on offer and we have seen the expansion of the corporate floating
rate note market.''

But Mr. Brad Scott, vice-president, head of fixed income credit research at
Salomon Smith Barney, said while the corporate bond market was of equal size
to the semi-government sector, the liquidity of the government bond market
still far outstripped the corporate market by a factor of more than three.

``As funds inflow continues to outstrip demand, deal sizes particularly in
the triple B land will need to continue to increase to attract offshore
demand and encourage broad-based turnover growth.

``Similarly, greater issue diversity and liquidity provided by global credit
markets will continue to attract more interest from funds who have money to
place and can't wait for the market to grow.''

KEY POINTS

* Australian financial markets' turnover was $38.3 trillion for the
year.
* Turnover in forward rate agreements increased by 101 percent, the
fastest growing market segment.
* Foreign exchange trading fell 16.7 per cent, the first fall since
1994.
* Trading in government debt securities fell for the fourth
consecutive year, down 1 per cent.

Capital Concerns
Risk - November 2000
By Oliver Bennett

There are plenty of people who believed it would or should - never happen.
But early next year, regulators are expected to announce a tier one capital
charge for operational risk.  Bankers who have worked closely with the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision say it is likely to recommend three
different options for banking supervisors: basic indicators (that is, a
single proxy for the entire bank, such as trading volumes); a business line
approach using Committee-imposed capital ratio; or thirdly, internal
measurement using a bank's own loss data within a supervisory specified
framework. The implication is that further and more detailed work on the
internal measurement approach may result an the development of appropriate
models and a fourth regulatory option, based on internal modelling.

There has been intense criticism from banks about an operational risk
capital charge through industry groups such as the International Swaps and
Derivatives Association (ISDA) and the British Bankers Association (BBA).
However, the Committee's consistent position on a capital charge for "other
risks" is encouraging initiatives to develop methodologies and coiled data
related to managing operational risk. Standardisation is some way off,
although there is growing industry agreement on a core operational risk
definition, the collection and sharing of internal loss data and the
importance of qualitative criteria.

The proposal took banks by surprise the absence of a standard methodology
led to fears of an arbitrary operational risk charge, supplementary to
existing capital charges for credit and market risk, based on size and
volume. Allen Wheat, chief executive officer and chairman of Credit Suisse
First Boston, speaking at Risk's annual European congress in Paris last
April, described the proposal for an operational risk capital charge as "the
dopiest thing I've ever seen".  Other leading banks like JP Morgan also
expressed concern that an operational risk capital charge was premature when
the industry had not come to an agreement on how important the issue was, or
how to measure it.  A rule-of-thumb measurement would not accurately reflect
different levels of risk in various banks and could result in overcharging
some banks for risk and undercharging others. Similarly, operational risk
capital charges could penalise banks competing against non-banking
organisations not subject to the charge.

The principal message to regulators is that larger banks with good
operational risk measurement and management should achieve lower capital
charges. However, without a standardised methodology, proposed operational
risk capital charge criteria need to be progressive, flexible and include a
risk-based option. Joseph Sabitini, managing director in the corporate risk
management group at JP Morgan in New York, recognises that a new regulatory
framework for operational risk must accommodate banks at all levels of
sophistication in terms of risk measurement and management, but that it also
includes a risk-based option for "those with the appropriate capability".
Sabitini, who has been working closely with the Risk Management Group of the
Committee, goes on to say that to avoid the shortcomings of the previous
Accord, the capital rules must also be transparent, uniform and consistency
applied.

A recent report by Meridien Research, the Massachusetts-based technology and
advisory service, concludes that in two to three years only one-third of
financial institutions will have the technology to measure and manage their
operational risks.  The report examines how financial institutions measure
up in a four-stage progression of addressing and implementing an operational
risk management strategy. In  the first stage, firms concentrate on the
identification of key risk Indicators and data collection. Stage two
involves developing metrics and tracking for the identified risks from stage
one. Stages three and four move on to using technology for the measurement
and management of those risks within a firm. The report gods on to say that
most firms are working in stages one and two of the operational risk
management process.

With the regulatory option to focus on specific business lines such as
investment banking, retail banking or asset management, banks are
concentrating on internal definitions and management strategies. But how are
they preparing for a capital charge? For most banks this includes
loss-gathering initiatives, key indicator information, risk assessment and
in some cases calculation However, unlike market risk and credit risk, a
purely quantitative approach to measure operational risk is not the current
focus.  Chris Rachlin, head of group operational risk at Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS), details the main initiatives his group have been focusing
on: "We have been identifying and implementing tools and techniques to help
our businesses identify, manage and monitor operational risks better. As
part of this we have been collecting data on loss
events. We have also looked at a number of quantification techniques, but
believe their effectiveness will depend on the quality and quantity of the
data available."

The current challenge is to find a way around the lack of data on big loss
experiences. Due to the rarity of these large losses, banks lack extensive
data on operational catastrophes such as Nick Leeson-style fraud or a
complete systems breakdown. According to Tony Peccia, vice-president in the
operational risk management division at CIBC World Markets in Toronto, most
banks would want to be at the internal measurement stage of the proposed
capital charge when implemented - which is dependent on internal data. This
has led to the establishment of a number of operational loss databases - in
particular,
introduction consortia of internal loss data-bases. The two principal
consortia are the Multinational Operational Risk Exchange managed by
NetRisk, and the Global Operational Loss Database (Gold), managed by the
BBA, which both provide a mechanism to share loss data in a secure
environment. The consortium members supply operational loss data, business
and risk characteristics to the managing agents.  The data is sanitised,
secured and scaled then returned to the consortium members As well as
assisting banks to manage their operational risks, the data can be used to
compare their performance against their competitors and highlight vulnerable
areas.  The More consortium has agreed to begin sharing data from November 1
2000 and receive the first batch of scrubbed, anonymous data by the end of
the year.

There are a number of concerns regarding data standards. According to
Richard Metcalfe, ISDA Assistant Director of European Policy: "There is
concern that, while the proposed Basle Committee rules incentivise data
gathering, that is not the only issued if banks record their losses in
general categories when submitting internal data but do not associate losses
with enough contextual information, it we be difficult to understand the
finer gradations of risk later on - or indeed to reclassify the database to
an agreed industry or regulatory
standard. Matt Kimber, a director with Arthur Andersen's financial practice,
welcomes initiatives to collect internal loss data to increase the breadth
of information available.  However, he goes on to say that users of the
information "will have to be mindful of the parameters as to how the
information is "gathered and prepared." Similar criticisms are also levelled
at publicly disclosed external loss databases, where issues of caring and
cleansing must be considered.

Last month, ISDA issued a discussion paper, Operational Risk Regulatory
Approach Discussion, on operational risk capital charges.  The paper
highlights concerns that a purely quantitative approach could enable
institutions with poor operational risk management processes and controls,
but with access to internal loss event data, to achieve a lower capital
charge that institutions with stronger risk management processes but no
access to internal loss event data. The paper also highlights fears over the
method of calculation of operational risk capital for an institution that
has recently experienced serious loss, but
where management has reacted and strengthened the control environment in
that area, and consequently reduced the likelihood of reoccurrence.

The paper, produced with the active support of over 20 ISDA member firms and
facilitated by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, sets out a series of structured and
transparent qualitative assessment criteria - with particular reference to
quantitative criteria - to complement the operational risk data requirements
currency proposed by regulators. The paper argues blat there is strong
support in the industry for a regulatory capital assessment model that
allows institutions managing operational risk to effectively access a more
precise means of Calculating an operational risk capital charge -
institutions should benefit from more sophisticated controls and the
regulatory regime should establish incentives to improve risk management and
controls.  This is consistent with proposed quantative techniques once
internal loss data is
incorporated into the operational risk capital charge calculation, as any
institution with an effective control environment would normally expect to
have a lower loss experience, and thus a lower capital charge.

According to Arthur Andersen's Kimber, there is another option - insurance.
"Insurance and risk transfer will become an important and sophisticated
component in an operational risk manager's tool-box over the next few years.
"There are definitely challenges for insurance providers in offering
operational risk cover, but there has been some recent headway in the last
year or two" In fact, regulators have made it clear that, in principle,
mechanisms such as insurance might be an acceptable way for banks to
mitigate risk and reduce their capital charges. Depending on the stance of
regulators, the Committee might insist that policies that mitigate the
capital charge pay out immediately after any operational disaster, or that
these polices only cover certain classes of operational risk. It may also
stipulate a specified credit rating of the insurance company, or the
percentage of risk that the primary insurer can sell into the wider
insurance market.

Possibly the most well-known operational risk insurance product is Swiss
Re's Financial Institutions Operational Risk Insurance (Fiord). With
Fidelity Investments as the first client for the re-insurance firm's
product, it is designed for the top 400 financial institutions in the world.
FIORI would have covered most of the devastating losses that have hit the
headlines over the last few years - 68% of them according to the insurer's
own analysis.  Lars Schmidt-Ott, head of global banking practice at Swiss Re
New Markets, sees insurance as a good alternative to capital charges.
"Holding Capital on the balance sheet is not good for shareholder value - if
you can keep it off the balance sheet at an efficient price you only pay the
downside premium."

But according to RBS's Rachlin, there are a number of problems with the
insurance option - principally the speed of payment and potential lack of
capacity for meaningful levels of rover from financially secure insurers.
Although some products on the market will provide immediate liquidity to a
bank following a disaster, there may be certain arguments after the event.
Policies with catastrophe levels of cover would also need to be scheduled or
layered, and it is not always possible to secure acceptance for finely
worded polices from differed underwriters.  Rachlin also highlights
reputational issues: "While insurance may cover the short-term financial
impact for some events the longer term reputation impact can be of greater
concern."  Although Schmidt-Ott does not agree that there are any
reputational issues using insurance products, he recognises that it may be
some time before gaining relief from operational risk charges becomes a real
incentive to take out insurance.  "Insurance will play a role as an
instrument for managing operational risk, but not in its current form....we
are waiting for the regulators."

Insurance aside, the Basle Committee's capital charge announcement for
operational risk is not eagerly awaited.  If the regulators make their
announcements in the first quarter of 2001 they probably would not become
effective until at least 2002.  Depending on the flexibility of the
proposals, research into internal modelling approaches to operational risk
is likely to intensify.  Victor Dowd, an associate involved with operational
risk capital charge discussion at the UK's Financial Services Authority
agrees that further and more detailed work on the internal measurement
approach may result in the development of appropriate models.  However, for
the present, he says," modelling is not an option" for the regulators to
consider.

Enron To Expand Weather Derivatives Cover
Derivatives Week - November 27, 2000

Enron Europe is set to start quoting weather derivatives on an additional 15
cities in Europe in the next two weeks. Thor Lien, v.p. and head of weather
risk management-Europe in Oslo, said Enron is adding the cities in the U.K.,
the Netherlands, Germany and France. Enron has since the beginning of the
year been offering weather coverage via its website (www.enrononline.com)
and voice brokers on London, Paris, Oslo and Stockholm, as well as some U.S
and Asian cities.

Lien predicts the European weather derivatives market will double in size to
approximately EURO-8 billion (USD5.1-6.8 billion) (total outstanding
notional) within a year. Fund managers and risk managers are growing more
interested in the product as liquidity and transparency increase. Although
customers will also be able to trade weather derivatives through Enron's
voice brokers, the company is putting the contracts on its web site to
entice players worldwide and increase liquidity, Lien said.

FOR SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS ONLY

Summary of Customer Comments and Southern's Responsive Proposals
Docket No. RP00-476

I.  OFOs AND PENALTIES

Comment 1:  Provide objective criteria for issuing and lifting OFOs
including information that will help customers better understand operational
situation being addressed

Response:  SNG does or will post warnings and forecasts in advance
of OFOs and will work with customers to clarify tariff language on a
mutually agreeable basis

Comment 2:  A $15.00 penalty for Type 3 Alert Mode OFO is not reasonable;
$7.50 is more reasonable

Response:  In the spirit of compromise, SNG would be willing to
decrease the penalty to $10.00 per dth as part of a settlement package.

Comment 3:  The short notice and harsh penalty of the Type 3 Emergency Mode
OFO is unreasonable for the following reasons:
- Customers need more time to make adjustments
o Only implement if a Type 3 Critical Mode OFO
is already in place
o 12 hours notice would be more appropriate
- Limit application to abusive shipper behavior
- Clarify tariff that penalty only applies at start of gas day
and not intraday
- Shorter notice is not justified because if implemented too
late, a firm shipper cannot bump IT on last nomination cycle
- Justify adding the gas price to the penalty
- The increased penalty price is really an increase in
imbalance charges without other benefits
- Use Gas Daily's "Midpoint Louisiana - Onshore South" daily
index price instead of the one proposed

Response:  As part of a settlement package, SNG is willing to make
the following changes to its Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO.
- Type 3 Emergency Mode OFO can be implemented at the start of
the gas day on (i) 20 hours prior notice, or (ii) 4 hours prior notice ONLY
if a Type 3 Alert or Critical Mode OFO is in effect for the previous day;
telephone notice will be given when the penalty is upgraded to Emergency.
- Language limiting the application of each OFO is set forth
in Section 41 of the tariff's general terms and conditions.  SNG is willing
to repeat this language in this specific OFO section of the tariff, however,
so that customers feel comfortable that implementation of this penalty will
be targeted to the operational problem areas on the system or specific
offenders whenever possible.
- SNG will clarify that penalties only apply at the start of a
gas day and can be cancelled during a gas day if not needed due to a change
in conditions.
- Since advance notice must always be given prior to the start
of a gas day (9:00 a.m. CCT), shippers can adjust nominations on the
Intraday 1 nomination cycle (10:00 a.m. CCT) and bump IT.
- At the meeting, SNG will further discuss the reasons its
penalties (including the higher penalty for Type 3 Emergency Mode) are
needed to preserve the operational integrity of the system.

Comment 4:   The change to Type 5 OFOs could result in a shipper in a group
being penalized even if it is within tolerance at a point

Response:  At the meeting, SNG will review an example of how the
proposed changes to the Type 5 OFO will actually avoid shipper-specific
penalties at a point when the point or group of receipt points is within
tolerance.  This provision will only help, never hurt, a shipper.


II.  SEGMENTATION

Comment 1:  SNG currently allows firm shippers to segment their capacity by
rate zone.  It should be operationally feasible to provide more
segmentation, especially along Southern's two main trunklines.

Response:  SNG has reviewed its operational model and has isolated
two "long line" segments of its pipeline along which it could allow
intrazone segmentation in an operationally feasible manner.  At the meeting,
SNG will review the physical attributes of its system that led to this
model.  To be able to provide this level of intrazone segmentation, the
program would have the following attributes:
- SNG will retain its existing segmentation program, but will
layer on top of that the ability for a shipper to fully segment along
identified long line segments of its north or south system up to the firm
capacity that the customer has on the long line being segmented.  For
example, if a customer has north system capacity into zone 2, it can do
intrazone segmentation along the long line portion of the north system
through zone 2 up to its contract quantity on the north system.
- On the long line on which the shipper has firm capacity, the
shipper can nominate to primary or secondary delivery points so long as the
nominations do not overlap along the long line segment.
- The shipper will have to path its receipts and deliveries
for the portion of its nomination where it wishes to do intrazone segments.
This allows SNG to verify that segments do not overlap.  The first delivery
point being segmented can be served by an upstream supply pool or storage,
but all downstream segments must be served by physical receipt-to-delivery
combinations.
- Allocated receipts serving an intrazone segmented delivery
would have to meet or exceed the segmented delivery to avoid overlapping
segments and qualify for the FT commodity rate.
- SNG is in the process of determining the programming
requirements to add this new, more complex model and will provide an
estimate at the meeting.

III.  CAPACITY RELEASE AND SCHEDULING EQUALITY

Comment 1:  SNG should allow customers to offer and bid on capacity release
deals before each of the four nomination cycles.  (In its filing, Southern
has offered to enhance its capacity release procedures to allow prearranged,
non-biddable deals to be awarded prior to each nomination cycle, but keep
biddable deals awarded according to the GISB standards prior to the Timely
Nomination Cycle.)

Response:  While Southern is not required to offer these additional
options under Order No. 637, it would be willing, as part of a settlement,
to add an offer/bid capacity release opportunity prior to the Evening
Nomination Cycle.  GISB is developing standards for intraday capacity
releases, and Southern proposes to wait until the standards are approved to
offer more flexibility due to the programming complexity.

Comment 2:  Changes that require programming should be implemented as soon
as possible if ready prior to the time estimated by SNG in its filing.

Response:  Southern will implement all changes as soon as the
programming is ready, and it will give 30 days advance notice of the
implementation date.

Comment 3:  Southern should allow releases of FT-NN service on a no-notice
basis as soon as possible.

Response:  As noted in its filing, Southern is in the process of
programming this functionality and proposes to implement it on March 1,
2001.  Southern plans to make its tariff filing in mid-January 2001, and
will host a conference call to discuss the tariff filing in early December
2000.

IV.  IMBALANCE MANAGEMENT AND MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS

Comment 1:  Customers need more than 3 business days to elect to trade
imbalances because imbalances are not final at the time of the election
deadline.

Response:  Effective December 1, 2000, for November imbalances,
Southern has filed to implement the new GISB standard that gives customers
17 business days after the end of the month to elect to trade imbalances and
to complete the trades.

Comment 2:  Southern should allow customers to use other customers' CSS/ISS
storage accounts to resolve imbalances at the end of the month.

Response:  While Southern is concerned that this may increase the
level of imbalances, in an overall settlement, it would be willing to add
this option, subject to active confirmation by the other customer whose
storage account is used to resolve the imbalance.

Comment 3:  Imbalances and overrun penalties should be based on the lesser
of operational or actual data.

Response:  Southern calculates both an estimated imbalance
percentage (on the last day of the month) and an actual imbalance percentage
and uses the lesser of the two percentages when cashing out imbalances.  On
the overrun comment, Southern bills all volumes actually metered, but fills
up a customer's firm transportation service within a zone prior to billing
IT overrun.

Comment 4:  Cash out revenues in excess of the index prices, less expenses
incurred by SNG for cash out gas, should be credited to the SCRM account.

Response:  Southern does credit all revenues received for cash out
and will provide an overview of the items that affect the SCRM account at
the meeting.

Comment 5:  Southern received comments in support of and in opposition to
the collection of injection or withdrawal fees on the net imbalance resolved
with storage at the end of the month.  It was suggested that Southern should
go further and collect the fee on the daily (instead of net) imbalance
resolved through storage.

Response:  Southern believes that its proposal is reasonable and
equitable for the reasons given in its filing.

Comment 6:  Southern should be required to honor discounts to alternate
delivery points within the capacity path of the point receiving the
discount.

Response:  Generally, FT reservation charge discounts continue to
apply even when alternate delivery points are nominated.  Any limitations on
the applicability of the discount to specific points will be agreed to as
part of the discount and will be set out in the discount exhibit.

The following is a summary of the Direct Access provisions in the bill language released this afternoon reflecting the deal that Davis cut with Assembly.  Things are very fluid and these provisions could change significantly.

I was just informed by the large business customers that they just met with the Davis' and Hertzberg's staff and the staff have agreed to amend the DA provisions to make them considerably more favorable for customers and suppliers.  They also said that favorable provisions with respect to self-gen would also be added to the bill. They said that these new amendments could come out as early as tonite or tomorrow morning and that the bill may be heard tomorrow.

Note:  In addition to the DA provisions, the bill also includes provisions that 1) explicitly recognize the PX Credit as part of Edison's undercollection, and 2) permit Edison to pay debts associated with the negative PX credit. (The bill does not authorize Edison to pay power suppliers, however, and leaves that portion of Edison's debt for Edison's management and shareholders to address.)

Summary of Direct Access provisions:

The program would begin January 1, 2003.
It's unclear what would happen to DA between now and January 1, 2003.  Presumably, the decision to suspend, or not, between now and then would stay with the California PUC.
90 days after the effective date of the bill, and every 6 months thereafter, DWR would provide information to the PUC showing the net short position.
Every 6 months, the PUC would hold an open season permitting customers to switch to DA.
20 KW-and-above customers would have 60 days to decide to switch once the PUC has announced the open season; under 20kw customers would have 180 days.
Customers who switch to DA would be responsible for paying 1) the customer's proportionate share of the utility's undercollection and 2) the customer's proportionate share of DWR's receivables (if any) for power previously delivered by DWR (but not yet fully paid for by customers).
In addition, if the number of customers who elect to choose to go DA in the open season exceeds the net short, then DA customers will have to pay their proportionate share of any DWR stranded contract costs.
If the number of DA customers does not exceed the net short position, then no stranded contract cost fees would be assessed.

Best,
Jeff

Greetings all --
Given my rather other-world state on yesterday's conference call, I wanted to fire off an e-mail to you to summarize current commercial activities on the Renewable Power Desk. I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and feel as though we're really gaining some traction.

Green Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group (headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of pricing proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags to green tags with embedded call options. Richard and I are working together to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and the East. I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these guys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so many public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should all do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this type of product. Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power, we will be able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and encourage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers. During the week of September 11, I plan to be in Houston to work extensively on drawing up the guidelines for the Alliance Program and working more closely with Richard and Stacey and their EES contacts to develop green power products for up-stream marketing and new origination efforts.

Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- LADWP is the largest green power buyer among public power agencies in California. Their green power buyer is heavily understaffed (and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowledge). He has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruition, manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable power products through Enron's existing Master Services Agreement with LADWP. This is an exciting (although not very profitable at this point) opportunity to establish the nodes of the California Renewable Power Pool and we see this as a way to bring our Services Desk functions to bear on the renewable sector in California. I am meeting with FPL Energy next week to discuss becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in California.

Wind Development -- As you may know, I purchased an option on a large parcel of windy land in Central Washington with enXco, a wind development concern. We are marketing the project to two of the munis in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle City Light and Eugene Water and Electric Board). Both have expressed interest. This morning I am meeting with the City of Portland to try to convince Portland to follow Seattle's lead as a zero-carbon growth city and signatory to the type of Kyotoesque committments recently announced by New England legislators.

Renewable Portfolio Standard -- The proposed CA RPS has major implications for our business, from both a risk management and commercial opportunity perspective. We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insight as to the political climate as possible. Having witnessed the first meeting of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento, I am personally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or form. If they pass a 1% requirement for new renewables next year, this translates into 430MWm off a 43,000MW peak load in CA. We have very good working relationships with several of the biomass generators in California, including generators with new resources, and we are actively negotiating a marketing agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the next couple of years. The critical question, of course, is who will actually have the short position in California? If it is just the DWR, then they will probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases. If the utilities end up serving load, they will be in the market looking for the least-cost resources, and new biomass will clearly be a part of the mix.

Pac Northwest RFPs -- Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RFPs out right now for green tags and retail marketing services. I am staying in touch with Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Green Mountain Energy and Community Energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions. I want to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to make it really easy for them to transact with us. We can use our market legs to get well-priced tags and then sell to them as they shoot for RFP successes. Bonneville Environmental, at a minimum, will need new biomass to blend in with their expensive wind energy tags.

Chicago -- Most of you probably met Mike Lindert at our Houston Renewables meeting earlier this month. He was the EES originator for the ComEd deal, and as you know, there is a significant renewable committment in Chicago. We need to get in front of the City of Chicago as soon as possible to talk about their next generation of renewable purchases. Stacey, I belive you have info on this.

Sustainable Products Training -- The Renewable Power Desk has donated RECs and CO2 offsets for the Sustainable Products Training in Austin, September 10 - 11. They are giving us lots of press and would like one or two of us to attend. If you are interested in heading up there for a day with me, please let me know. There should be a pretty good turnout among potential commercial and industrial customers.

Kinkos -- All indications are that our negotiations with Kinko's are going very well. The hope is to sell them a three-year fixed-price retail product and 100% wind tags. Richard and I are woking to source the tags. Success will be huge, as Kinkos is part of the Green Power Market Development Group.

I know that Richard and Stacey have other deals on the table, and Jesse has been busy working on finalizing our services deal with Edwards Air Force Base. I look forward to seeing you guys in Houston the week of September 11 and taking the next steps in formalizing our green product offerings.

Talk to you soon,

EM

HEADLINE: Testimony says Duke Energy actions 'unconscionably wrong'

BYLINE: By Dion Nissenbaum

BODY:

SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A major energy company accused of gouging California
ran
one plant like a "yo-yo," scaling back the flow of electricity even as the
state
was trying desperately to find power to avert blackouts, a former plant worker
told state investigators Friday.

In a packed Capitol hearing room, former mechanic Glenn Johnson called such
actions at the Chula Vista plant run by Duke Energy "absolutely,
unconscionably
wrong."

Armed with control room logs taken from the plant, Johnson and two other
former plant workers publicly offered the special Senate committee
investigating
alleged price gouging the first inside accounts of power plant operations and
provided them with hard evidence for their ongoing investigation.

Lawmakers said they wouldn't draw conclusions until they get a chance later
this summer to hear from Duke, which leases the plant from the Port of San
Diego.

But one senator, Steve Peace, D-La Mesa, said he is already convinced that
Duke has broken its contract, which requires the plant to use "prudent
practices."

"I believe the evidence is clear that Duke has operated, and is operating in
violation of its lease," Peace said. "I believe the port can take it back."

While not given a chance to rebut the testimony at the hearing, Duke
executives dismissed the three men as misguided former workers who had small
roles in a big operation and didn't understand what they were seeing.

"This is one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated
by people who are not telling, or do not know, the full story," said Bill
Hall,
vice president of Duke's West Coast operations.

Duke did change the amount of energy it produced, Hall said. But, in
everycase, he added, the company did so at the direction of state regulators
who
oversee the ebb and flow of power.

"Duke Energy is not gouging," he said.

Senate investigators plan to match state records to the Duke logs to see if,
as the company executives argue, each decision was made at the request of
regulators. After reviewing the records Friday afternoon, the committee staff
expressed skepticism about Duke's contention that the decisions, some of them
made after midnight, were directed by state officials.

Assistant plant operator Jimmey Olkjer decoded the handwritten logs for
lawmakers, pointing out when and how Duke shifted power production. In one
case
on Jan.16, the logs show, the plant directed workers to slow production from
92
megawatts to 30 megawatts. An hour later, the state issued a Stage 3 alert
indicating power reserves were low and blackouts imminent. In the next few
hours, Duke pushed production up to 149 megawatts.

Such moves, Olkjer said before the hearing, appeared to be an effort to
manipulate the market to boost prices.

California uses complex maneuvers to make sure that it has enough power. At
times, because of congestion on transmission lines, regulators actually pay
energy companies to scale back production because they can't move it around
the
state.

But state regulators declined to comment on the allegations or the logs,
saying they are prevented from discussing specific arrangements with Duke or
other private companies. The Chula Vista plant produces enough power for about
500,000 homes. Duke has leased the plant since 1998.

Under scrutiny

Along with the state's other major power producers, Duke is under intense
scrutiny for its actions in California's dysfunctional electricity markets.
The
company is facing state and federal investigations, as well as a class-action
lawsuit.

Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who is spearheading a taxpayer lawsuit against
Duke
and other power companies for alleged price gouging, called the whistle-blower
testimony "the tip of the iceberg."

This week, federal officials again ordered Duke to refund California what
could be millions of dollars for alleged overcharges. Duke has admitted that
it
charged a record $3,880 per megawatt-hour in January for some of its power.
The
company said it provided the power at California's request as the state tried
to
head off blackouts, tacking on an 80 percent surcharge because of Pacific Gas
&
Electric Co.'s credit problems.

Executives for Duke and other power producers will head to Washington, D.C.,
next week to take part in marathon settlement talks over alleged price
gouging.
Gov. Gray Davis and other California leaders contend that the companies
overcharged the state by nearly $8.9 billion.

At the hearing, Olkjer and Johnson were joined by former mechanic Ed
Edwards.
All three worked for the plant's former operator, San Diego Gas and Electric,
and continued working during a two-year transition period when Duke took over.
They were all let go in April.

Edwards and Olkjer told the committee that they had stellar personnel
records. Johnson conceded that he was not considered a model employee because
he
sometimes complained to his union about mistreatment and spent a lot of time
off
work serving in the California National Guard.

Johnson and Edwards told lawmakers that they were directed to throw out
perfectly good spare parts to clear space in the plant. They said that
sometimes
caused delays of days or weeks in getting it back up-and-running.

Duke said it threw out the spare parts to get rid of old or obsolete
equipment.

The hearing drew sharp criticism from the state's largest independent power
producer group.

In a letter to Sen. Joe Dunn, the Garden Grove Democrat heading the
committee, the group accused lawmakers of setting aside facts in pursuit of a
media event "giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of disgruntled
employees."

"The committee is at a crossroads," wrote Jan Smutny-Jones, executive
director of the Independent Energy Producers. "It can choose to engage in
fact-finding and analysis, or it can be reduced to a witch hunt in pursuit of
headlines."

Dunn angrily challenged the characterization of his hearings and said he
plans to give Duke and other power companies plenty of time to respond in the
coming weeks.

Sen. Bill Morrow of San Juan Capistrano, the ranking Republican, agreed with
Dunn and rejected notions that the committee is a "kangaroo court."

HEADLINE: 3 new plants to generate electricity within weeks

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that three new power plants will begin
operating within 17 days, giving California its first new major generators in
more than a decade and easing the threat of blackouts this summer.

News about the plants comes on the heels of other developments about
conservation and additional power supply that have given state officials
increasing confidence in California's ability to survive the power crisis this
summer.

''Optimistically,'' said Davis, ''our conservation and generation effort
will
help us minimize any disruptions this summer.''

One of the new plants was scheduled to begin operating in August but instead
will come on line Wednesday. Edison International's Sunrise plant near
Bakersfield will supply 320 megawatts. A megawatt can provide enough power for
750 to 1,000 households.

In addition to the Edison facility, Calpine will open its 500-megawatt
Sutter
plant near Yuba City on July 2 and its 559-megawatt Los Medanos plant near
Pittsburg 10 days later. Both plants are expected to open according to
schedule.

''In the next 17 days we will put more power on line than California did in
the last 12 years,'' Davis said.

During the past decade, the governor said, the state added less than 1,000
megawatts with a number of small power plants, despite population growth and
increased power demand from the high-tech industry.

The fast-track modernization of a 450-megawatt Huntington Beach plant is
expected by late August. The plant was shut down about five years ago.

By September, Davis said, the addition of eight to 10 small plants that
operate during peak-load periods, as well as increased power from a variety of
other small generators, will raise the total of new power coming this summer
to
4,000 megawatts.

As further protection against blackouts, state power buyers revealed last
week that in recent months they have been able to send some surplus
electricity
to a Canadian utility, BC Hydro, which will return the power in July and
August.

Despite efforts to increase the state's energy supply this summer, more
ultimately will be needed. California has been importing about 20 percent of
its
power in recent years. Even though about a dozen power plants are approved or
under construction, Davis does not expect supply to match demand until late
2003. Until then, the state will need surplus electricity generation to make
the
deregulated market work properly, experts say.

Davis has said in the past that California should add 20,000 megawatts of
power generation in the years ahead. A new state Power Authority has been
created that could construct or buy power plants if the private sector does
not
build a surplus of electricity generation.

Also, state officials suggest the trend among Californians to conserve
electricity may grow.

The state is spending $850 million on conservation programs, including
funding for energy-efficient equipment and an advertising campaign. The
program
gives refunds to customers who dramatically reduce their electricity
consumption
this summer.

State officials also expect electricity use to be reduced by ''sticker
shock'' from rate increases beginning this month for Edison and Pacific Gas
and
Electric customers. Ratepayers are exempt from the increase if they use 130
percent or less of the baseline level of electricity, a minimal amount that
varies with regional climate zones.

A proposal to increase rates for San Diego Gas & Electric customers is
pending before the state Public Utilities Commission.

In addition to announcing the new plants, Davis yesterday reiterated his
demand that California deserves $8.9 billion in refunds from overcharges by
power companies. That issue will be the subject of mediation sessions that
begin
today in Washington.

When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed regional price limits
last week, the regulators asked an administrative law judge to recommend
possible refunds by generators for overcharging.

Davis said the California negotiating team will be led by Michael Kahn,
chairman of the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
electricity
grid.

Davis said Kahn's team will present information supporting California's
claim
of overcharging. The administrative law judge, Curtis Wagner Jr., suggested
last
week that California may be owed a smaller amount, $2 billion to $2.5 billion.

The governor sent Wagner a brief letter replying to the judge's request for
a
list of issues that should be considered in the conference.

''Our list is short,'' Davis said in the letter. ''The conference must
address the need to have FERC order power sellers to refund the estimated $8.9
billion they have overcharged the people of the State of California.''

While that session is taking place, Davis today plans to meet in Sacramento
with President Bush's two new appointees to the five-member FERC, Pat Wood III
of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania.

Davis said that when he met with the president last month, Bush agreed to
send Wood to California to investigate natural gas prices, which are several
times higher in California than in New York.

''We agreed that there is no explanation for the disparity of prices between
California and New York when it comes to natural gas,'' Davis said. ''We
agreed
that was wrong.''

The governor also said he will meet this morning with three former employees
of Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant who have accused the company of
altering the plant's output to boost power prices.

The employees last week told a state Senate committee that they were ordered
to reduce power during peak-load periods and throw away good replacement
parts,
which sometimes delayed maintenance.

''There may be another side to the story,'' Davis said. ''But these three
employees worked 20 years, had no reason to mislead the state Senate, and they
testified under oath.''

Duke denied wrongdoing and said power was reduced at the request of the
agency that runs the power grid, the Independent System Operator.

A Davis spokesman said yesterday that he did not know if the former
employees
could qualify for a reward. In April, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer
announced a whistle-blower reward for information on price-gouging by power
generators.

Lockyer said the reward would be based on a percentage of what the state
recovers as a result of the information. He said the reward could be worth $50
million or more.

Power Regulators to Determine State Refunds;
Energy: Generators and California officials will work together for 15 days to
solve the huge mathematical problem.

BYLINE: MEGAN GARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

Starting today, federal power regulators will begin trying to solve one of
the riddles of the energy crisis: How much of a refund will California get?

One thing seems clear: The reduction will be a lot more than the
$125-million
refund ordered to date, in all likelihood soaring to more than $1 billion.

Over the next 15 days--the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is mandating
no weekends off--warring representatives from power companies and the state of
California will sit at the same table in a government conference room while a
FERC task force wrestles the question to the ground.

The task is to determine the price that power would have cost if FERC's
decision to impose soft caps had been made not last week, but last fall.

It is a daunting mathematical problem, factoring in hourly charges during
the
last eight months. To come up with a total, federal regulators, state
electricity officials and power generators must determine what the highest
price
for a megawatt should have been under the soft price caps now in effect. Then
they have to figure out which companies--if any--were charging more.

Under the recent FERC ruling, the price of electricity during any given hour
cannot exceed the actual cost of generating the least efficient--or most
expensive--power coming into the grid.

Curtis L. Wagner, the 72-year-old chief judge for FERC who is overseeing
negotiations on California's overcharges, said of this morning's events: "It
will be a zoo."

Wagner, who headed into the weekend with three inches of documents to sort
through, explained that Gov. Gray Davis wants $9 billion knocked off the
amount
the power generators charged California. "I don't really think it's that
high,"
said Wagner, predicting the refund will be more than $1 billion but probably
far
from $9 billion.

"We have folks trying to do some adding now and some work on what the number
should be," he said.

Wagner said the money at stake will be the most he has worked on in his
nearly three-decade career at the agency.

Until recently, the likelihood of massive refunds seemed nil. Although
California lawmakers--led by Davis--had demanded relief for costs that ran as
high as 10 times or more than the rates a year ago, FERC officials had not
agreed.

And their minds seemed set. When FERC first proposed remedies for the
California price increases late last year, commissioners said: "Refunds may be
an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental solution
to
any problems occurring in California markets."

To date, FERC has ordered $125 million in refunds for alleged overcharges in
January and February.

But with the recent appointment of two new commissioners by President
Bush--Republicans Patrick H. Wood III of Texas and Nora M. Brownell of
Pennsylvania--FERC's position softened, leading to the price mitigation
ordered
last week.

Now FERC is taking a closer look at the prices already charged.

California lawmakers have pegged overcharges at nearly $9 billion since the
California market went haywire last summer--a number that comes from a study
done by Cal-ISO, the operator of California's electricity grid. Cal-ISO
officials acknowledged last week that the study might have significant flaws.

Among companies that may be required to reduce their bills are energy giants
Enron Corp., Mirant Corp., Duke Energy Corp., Williams Cos. and Reliant Energy
Inc.--all of which are expected to have representatives at the negotiations.
The
companies have hotly disputed the amount of overcharges alleged by Davis and
other California lawmakers and point out that they have yet to be paid for the
vast majority of electricity sold in the state in recent months.

Today, Wagner said he plans to make opening statements to the media. After
that, he said he hasn't determined how much of the wangling will be done
behind
closed doors. If the parties don't come to an agreement in 15 days, Wagner
will
have seven days to make a recommendation on refunds to FERC's five
commissioners.

It is a process that may be repeated down the road if Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) and other California politicians get their way. Boxer has
introduced
legislation that would give FERC retroactive power to order refunds--all the
way
back to July 2000, when San Diego first faced huge spikes in electricity
costs.

In the Dark, Trying to See Light at End of Crisis

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

It's dusk in the Capitol office of state Sen. Debra Bowen. Actually, it's
midafternoon. But she has the lights off to save electricity and not much sun
is
coming through a shaded window.

Her thermostat is set at 76 degrees, but it feels warmer because outside
it's
100 and she's up on the fourth floor.

There's a bright red, oversized cover framing a shiny white light switch by
the door. You can't miss it leaving the room. "That's for the people who have
trouble turning off lights," she says.

Bowen, 45, a Marina del Rey Democrat and environmental lawyer, represents
the
good side of term limits. Conscientious and cutting-edge. She replaced a
termed-out, octogenarian senator, Ralph Dills, first elected to the
Legislature
in the Great Depression.

Since coming to the Assembly in 1992, Bowen has focused on environmental
protection, foster children and high-tech--most recently trying,
unsuccessfully,
to guard the privacy of Internet consumers.

But now, like the Legislature itself, she's bogged down with an
all-consuming
issue that won't go away. The senator has been thrust into the middle of a
tangled energy mess she and other lawmakers unwittingly helped create with
their
lemming-like votes five years ago.

This time, however, Bowen is a major player as head of the Senate energy
committee.

Something must be going right, I note. We haven't had any of those rolling
blackouts everybody had predicted for June.

"My biggest concern," she replies, sitting in the twilight, "is that we're
being fooled right now because of the early snowmelt. We've got more power
than
we need."

Hydroelectric power being generated by the Sierra runoff, she explains, is
being sent to British Columbia. BC is using the California power and keeping
its
own water stored behind dams. Later in summer, as this state runs dry, BC will
generate hydro and send it to us.

Thus every kilowatt California saves today can be banked in Canada and later
withdrawn during tough times.

"I don't want people to get the idea that just because we haven't had Stage
2s or blackouts we shouldn't be concerned," Bowen says. "We're still going to
be
short power this summer. . . .

"But how do you expect Jane Citizen to figure all this out?"

Especially when Joe and Janice Legislator are having such a difficult time.

There is one vexing problem still facing the Legislature on energy. It has
passed bills promoting conservation, expediting power plant construction,
authorizing the state to sign long-term contracts for wholesale electricity,
creating a state power authority and approving bond sales to finance it all.
What's left is how--and whether--to save Southern Cal Edison from bankruptcy.

The Legislature faces an Aug. 15 deadline to approve a memo of understanding
between Gov. Gray Davis and Edison. After that, the MOU presumably goes poof
and
Edison collapses.

But the Legislature has a cocky way of ignoring and testing deadlines. Right
now there must be 100 ideas about how to handle Edison. Decision-making is
diffused. Bowen's energy committee, for example, is just one of three that is
holding Senate hearings on the Edison bailout.

"There's not much consensus," she acknowledges.

The governor's proposed Edison rescue involves state purchase of the
utility's transmission lines for about $2.8 billion. Democrats seem ambivalent
and Republicans are opposed. Long ago, the MOU was diagnosed as DOA.

Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco)--the most powerful
legislator--thinks the MOU is a giveaway to Edison.

In the Assembly, Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) has been pushing a
unique alternative he believes could also work for PG&E, now struggling in
Bankruptcy Court. Under his plan, only the "core" residential and small
business
users would be served by private utilities. Electricity would be generated by
the utilities themselves and regulated by the Public Utilities Commission.
Like
the good old days before disastrous deregulation.

The "noncore" big power users who wanted deregulation in the first place
would buy electricity directly from the generators and marketers, presumably
at
a savings. "They're the ones who brought this on us," Hertzberg says.

But, he adds, "there's a billion moving parts" and they're not fitting well.
For one, there may not be enough power to buy directly now that the state has
cornered so much in long-term contracts.

Bowen is one of the better ones. But not even she is sure what the
Legislature's next step should be. "We don't have a lot of room to move," she
says.

Nor a lot of time. If Edison goes bankrupt, it truly will be a dark day in
the Capitol.

HEADLINE: Demand Had Minor Role in Power Crisis;
Electricity: Consumption has been predictable, and rose less quickly than in
other Western states. But supply grew hardly at all, and reserves melted away.

BYLINE: ROBIN FIELDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

California has been depicted as a power addict whose growing habit led
inexorably to the crisis that has roiled the state since May 2000.

Yet the state's electricity yen is the wrong target for blame--the least
volatile and least decisive piece of a larger puzzle, an analysis of
consumption
patterns shows.

California consumption has been as regular as a heartbeat in the last
decade,
sloping upward gently with a blip each summer. In the last year, demand's
predictability made it the lone calm spot within a hailstorm of dizzying price
peaks and supply lurches.

Moreover, California's power consumption increased far less than that of its
Western neighbors, on whose excess supply it had come to depend.

"Yes, demand grew in California, but what people who have that discussion
ignore is that demand in the rest of the West grew even faster," said Severin
Borenstein, director of the UC Energy Institute in Berkeley. "We're all part
of
the same grid."

Within the complex, sometimes murky power picture, demand was a problem
hiding in plain sight.

Starting in 1998, energy agencies began to warn that its slow swell, coupled
with stagnant supply, had left California with wafer-thin power reserves. In
retrospect, these agencies say, deregulation left them powerless to prevent
the
impending collision between supply and demand.

When they hit head-on last summer, the amount of power used day to day by
Californians often had no relationship to the periods when the state
experienced
blackouts or the highest wholesale prices, analysts said.

In the last 10 years, California's power consumption has moved subtly, never
advancing more than 3.7% a year and, even at its height, lagging behind such
other measures as job growth and economic output.

In the early 1990s, recession savaged heavy-duty power users, ranging from
manufacturers to agricultural interests to the aerospace industry. The
industrial sector's usage actually declined from 1990 to 1995.

Overall, consumption inched up so slowly in the decade's first half--just
1.3%--that demand was of little concern as policymakers assembled the
mechanisms
of deregulation, current and former industry officials say.

The system's reserve cushion--the extra supply available at peak times--was
estimated in 1993 at a robust 12% to 14.5%, without a single electron imported
from beyond California's borders. With pressure off, utilities shifted
resources
out of programs promoting conservation and redistributing peak-hour
consumption.
Instead, they focused on new technologies that had little immediate payoff.

"There was less emphasis on demand management," said Barbara Barkovitch, an
Oakland-based consultant who served on the California Independent System
Operator's board from its formation in 1998 until last June. "There was
nothing
nefarious about it, but people always assume the future will be like the
present."

As the economy rebounded, consumption growth averaged about 3% a year. That
slight escalation--which fell within the expectations of forecasters at the
California Energy Commission--took on out-sized significance because it
occurred
as supply stagnated.

"The problem was not one of demand in isolation, but that our demand kept
growing steadily, supply did not grow much at all, and the gap just shrank
progressively," said Ahmad Faruqui, the Palo Alto-based Electric Power
Research
Institute's area manager for retail and power markets.

Regionally, the expansion was uneven, weighted toward the fast-developing
San
Diego area and Northern California's tech corridor. Consumption in San Diego
Gas
& Electric's service area rose more than 17% from 1995 to 2000 and, for the
decade, increased almost twice as much as in the state overall.

The commercial sector's usage grew twice as fast in the decade's last five
years as it had in its first half as the economic mix shifted toward services
and offices loaded up on energy-eating technology.

The heady affluence of the late '90s also inflated residential consumption.

Consumers splurged on bigger houses, pools and spas, more appliances and
up-to-the-minute gadgetry, said Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area
Economic Forum. Fixed retail prices meant consumers had little incentive to
rein
themselves in, analysts said.

"We decided we were not going to have a process for adjustment on the demand
side," Borenstein said. "We relied entirely on the supply side and that turned
out to be a huge mistake."

Still, even as consumption grew, businesses became more efficient. Measured
per capita, California's consumption remained modest compared to that of less
efficient, more weather-intensive states.

But gradually and quietly, the system's reserve margin shrank to 4% by 1998,
a third or less than they had been at their fattest. Even that depended
heavily
on seasonal help from the other states that share California's grid, help they
were increasingly less able to give.

Electricity consumption in Arizona, Colorado and Utah grew at about twice
California's rate from 1988 to 1998. It expanded three times as fast in
Nevada.
In these states, too, supply did not keep up.

The collapse that started in May 2000 could have begun a year earlier if not
for cool weather and plentiful rain, yielding cascades of Pacific Northwest
hydroelectric power.

At least six state, regional and federal energy agencies issued reports from
late 1998 to early 2000 warning that California's reserve margin had
shriveled,
that help from other Western states might decrease, and that the state was one
hot summer away from disaster.

"The Arizona-New Mexico-Southern Nevada and the California-Mexico areas of
[the Western transmission grid] may not have adequate resources to
accommodate a
widespread severe heat wave or a higher-than-normal forced outage rate for
generation," wrote the North American Electric Reliability Council in its June
1999 summer assessment. "Those areas are experiencing a continuing trend of
peak
demand growth exceeding the addition of new generation facilities."

But in the deregulated system, regulators no longer had a decisive hand in
balancing supply and demand. Officials at the California Energy Commission say
even analyzing the situation became harder as utilities became less methodical
in submitting their consumption data.

"Things got sloppier," said Michael Jaske, the commission's chief forecaster
since 1980. "The utilities started letting that stuff slide, poorer data was
coming in to us, and our management wasn't going after them the same way."

Marketplace incentives were supposed to replace government control, but new
supply did not materialize even though rising demand had created a clear-cut
opportunity.

Private generators say the system's uncertainties, plus California's
environmental fervor and slow regulatory process, prevented the market from
working. Borenstein's assessment is blunt: "The reason that no one built power
plants was that no one thought you could make money at it."

Ultimately, the flurry of studies predicting an oncoming crisis circulated
among regulators and power industry insiders, but prompted little urgency when
it came to curtailing demand. The Davis administration focused on supply
instead, taking steps to expedite the approval process for power plants, Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio said.

"Hindsight is always 20-20," he said. "We weren't having blackouts in '99,
so
it didn't pop up on anyone's radar."

Summer 2000 took care of that, hitting like a sonic boom.

Hot weather caused consumption to jump almost 4% year-over-year, double the
decade-long average. Peak demand from May through August was consistently
about
10% higher than in summer 1999, averaging an extra 3,200 megawatts per
day--enough to power more than 3 million homes.

On Aug. 16, the day with the year's highest peak, Cal-ISO's so-called
spinning reserve--the amount of capacity that can be brought on line within 10
minutes--was 1.2%.

The causal link between heightened usage and other pressure signals, from
higher spot-market prices to staged emergencies, seemed clear.

Or was it? Peak demand still fluctuated within a narrow range only
marginally
above long-standing forecasts. The so-called superpeak--the moment of highest
usage on summer's most brutal day--was lower than in uneventful 1999.

Moreover, after summer's heat ebbed, California's consumption tapered.
Still,
the power crisis' other symptoms raged on.

In November and December, wholesale power prices soared, California paid far
more for natural gas than the rest of the nation, and the first rolling
blackouts hit. Yet peak demand traced an almost identical line as it had the
year before, averaging a few megawatts less.

Peak demand was down again from January to April when rolling blackouts
returned, averaging about 1,600 megawatts less than in the same stretch of
2000,
which passed without a single emergency.

State officials were quick to blame suppliers, but many industry analysts
point to the region-wide supply-demand equation.

These forces may continue to dominate, they acknowledge, even though
Californians have cut back on consumption faster and more this year than state
officials had dared to hope.

In May, peak demand dropped 10.4% below its 2000 level and consumption fell
11%, marking the fifth straight month of reductions.



Electricity Demand

Electricity use in California has shown no dramatic shifts over the last
several years, increasing at an average of about 2% a year. In the last year,
its predictability has stood in stark contrast to the gyrations of supply and
wholesale prices. Total consumption of electricity in the state, in thousands
of
gigawatt-hours:

HEADLINE: Pending Power Plants in California Face Some Problems

BYLINE: By Steve Johnson

BODY:


SAN JOSE, Calif.--Although California's summer energy outlook seems to be
brightening, state leaders still are counting on new power plants to boost
competition and lower electricity prices in years to come.

They may end up disappointed.

Even with 42 new power plants in the works before the California Energy
Commission as of early last week, the state can't be sure of how much power
they
will produce or what prices they will charge, experts say. That could prove
troublesome, since 70 percent of the power the state plans to buy through
long-term contracts is supposed to come from these new plants.

Nor is there any guarantee of the price these plants might charge for the
rest of their power on the spot market, despite last Monday's order by federal
regulators to generally limit spot prices across the West.

Like much of what has happened since the state passed deregulation, the
future appears cloudy. Here's why:

-- Critics say the price caps ordered Monday by the Federal Energy
Regulatory
Commission contain loopholes that could allow California's electricity costs
to
soar on days when it is desperate for power. And when the Mercury News asked
12
of the companies involved in the recently approved or pending power plants if
they could promise that their spot market prices would be cheaper than what
California has been paying recently, none could.

-- Of the 25 mostly private entities involved in these new power plant
projects, only six are generators new to the state, and most of their plants
are
relatively small. That may slow the development of a more competitive
electricity market, which state officials say is needed to lower prices.

-- More than a third of the electricity to be produced by these new
operations would be controlled by firms accused in recent lawsuits or
governmental actions of questionable pricing and, in some cases, outright
gouging. State officials claim that some of these companies, among other
things,
have shut down their plants when electricity demand was high to artificially
crimp supplies and inflate prices.

-- Some experts doubt that all of the proposed plants will get built.
Several
power companies acknowledged that the intense criticism of them by California
officials and uncertainties over the economic viability of owning plants here
could cause them to delay or even abandon their projects. Others suspect these
firms eventually may cancel some of the plants they have proposed, to keep
power
in short supply and prices high.

"I'm concerned," said California Public Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood,
when asked about the makeup of the firms proposing the new plants. "It's the
same cartel. We will have more generation, but we will have the same players
owning and controlling it."

Such comments irk power suppliers, who have repeatedly denied breaking any
laws or regulations governing the sale of wholesale electricity. Many of these
entrepreneurs find it particularly galling that the very state officials
accusing them of price gouging are begging them to build plants in
California.

Few politicians have been as vehement in their denunciation of electricity
suppliers as Gov. Gray Davis. Yet he is among those relying heavily on the new
power plants these companies are developing to help pull California out of its
energy crisis.

"Eventually when supply and demand come back into something approaching
balance, there will be genuine price competition," Davis said in December. He
repeated the point earlier this month, proclaiming that "by the fall of 2003,
we
will have more power than we need. That will solve the long-term problem."

Davis isn't alone. Although power costs have fallen in recent weeks and
federal officials may impose tougher price controls on electricity, the
assumption that more plants is the key to solving California's troubles is
taken
as gospel by many state and federal officials.

It seems logical enough. More power presumably would not only ease the
threat
of blackouts, but relieve California of the need to pay exorbitant prices on
days when electricity is in short supply.

But calculating how much more power the state will wind up with, based on
how
many plants are on the drawing board, is risky, say some state regulators and
consumer advocates.

"I have no confidence at the moment that a majority of those new plants will
ever materialize," because power companies are likely to maintain an
electricity
shortage to keep prices high, said Michael Shames, of the Utility Consumers
Action Network. "Why would they want to change what they've got? They've got a
sweet deal."

Another reason plants might not get built is politics. Several firms with
projects in the works claimed that threats by state officials to seize their
plants or impose a windfall profits tax on their sales had made it harder to
obtain financing.

"Every time these politicians start spouting off to improve their own
political careers, they don't realize the damage they're doing," said Gary
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum.

Just this month, Mirant Corp. of Atlanta received state permission to build
a
530 megawatt plant in Contra Costa County -- enough to supply power to about
400,000 homes -- and it has applied to build a similarly-sized generator in
San
Francisco. But its spokesman Chuck Griffin said both projects are on hold,
until
Mirant feels more comfortable about the state's political and economic
climate.

"We have to be able to determine that it's going to be a viable investment,"
he said.

Even if all 42 plants are built, many of the companies proposing them were
skittish about promising cheaper prices. They said it depends on such things
as
the future cost of natural gas, which many of their plants use for fuel.

One firm California is counting on is Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which
already commands a modest fleet of small plants in the state and is developing
nearly one fourth of the 42 new plants.

Although Calpine has earned huge profits in recent months, it has a
relatively good reputation among consumer advocates and state investigators
who
have reviewed its confidential power sales data. Moreover, Calpine's name is
conspicuously absent from recent lawsuits and federal legal filings that have
either accused other firms of gouging or questioned the reasonableness of
their
prices.

Much of the power to be generated from Calpine's new plants will be sold in
long-term contracts to the state, according to company spokesman Bill
Highlander. But like other suppliers, he was vague about what it would charge
for the rest.

"It kind of depends on a whole number of factors," Highlander said,
including
how much people conserve and how much power California can continue importing
from other states. Since no one can predict such things today, he added,
"that's
what makes it so difficult."

If anyone should be concerned about the price of power it's the folks at
PG&E
Corp., who have blamed high electricity costs for forcing their utility --
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. -- into bankruptcy. But even they wouldn't
speculate
about how much they would charge for the power from their 1,048 megawatt plant
in Kern County, which is to be built by their unregulated affiliate, PG&E
National Energy Group. PG&E's energy trading arm is among the suppliers
accused
of questionable pricing practices, although PG&E officials have denied any
wrongdoing.

By the time the Kern County plant is done in two years, "if we have a
situation where we are seeing a lot more generation come on line in the state,
economic law should dictate that prices will come down," said PG&E Corp.
spokesman Greg Pruett. But that's not for certain, he said, adding, "we've all
gone to school about how topsy-turvy the market could become."

Like every other generator, PG&E doesn't plan to spend a lot of money
building a plant just to wind up giving away its electricity. "Obviously,"
Pruett said, "everyone who invests in these is doing so to earn a profit."

$9 billion showdown over power;

State delegation seeking refunds

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill, Christian Berthelsen

BODY:
A critical showdown in California's energy crisis starts this morning, as
state
officials meet with energy companies to demand $9 billion in refunds.

A 15-day settlement conference, ordered as part of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's decision last week to put price controls on wholesale
electricity prices, will bring together the parties that have been squabbling
for the past year.

"We are going to Washington with one goal, and that is to bring back $9
billion," Gov. Gray Davis told reporters yesterday. "The fact is that people
have taken advantage of the market, gamed the system and ripped people off."

But Davis' crusade may be dampened by challenges to the study the state
used
to arrive at the $9 billion figure and by a FERC mediator's prediction that
California will walk away with less than it is demanding.

The Democratic governor's figure is based on an update of a March study by
the California Independent System Operator, which manages the sate's power
grid.
Some energy experts argue the study is flawed, but the ISO stood firm behind
its
methodology yesterday.

Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the FERC administrative law judge who will oversee
the
meeting, said in an interview with The Chronicle yesterday that he was
optimistic a settlement would be reached.

Wagner said the $9 billion "seems a little high. And the generators'
numbers
seem low. We'll probably come out somewhere in between."

The veteran mediator, who spent yesterday reviewing spreadsheets submitted
by the parties, said he will look at applying last week's commission price
control order back to October.

"I think we should put the refund issue to rest," Wagner said. "I'm sure we
can agree on a structure that is fair to everybody." Enron Corp, Reliant
Energy
Inc., Duke Energy Corp., Williams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Mirant Corp. are among
the companies facing allegations of illegally overcharging California. The
companies say the high prices were a result of the high costs of natural gas
used to generate power.

"There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone," said
Mark Stultz, a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association, which
represent the generators.

But Davis insisted that the state will recover the full amount it is
asking.

"Under the law, FERC has no discretion," he said. "It is mandated to refund
excessive charges, if prices were found to be unjust and unreasonable, which
they were."

The governor, however, acknowledged that some of the money he is demanding
may be owed by municipal utilities that do not fall under FERC's jurisdiction.

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said municipal utilities such as Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power and BC Hydro that sold electricity to the state
have been invited to join the talks as well.

"We need the FERC to lay the basis to seek refunds from private generators,
and use that as a basis to seek refunds from public generators," she said.

California could face an obstacle in its case for the full repayment it
seeks. Under FERC rules, overcharges can only be authorized after a formal
investigation is ordered, which in this case started on Oct. 2, 2000. If
Wagner
sticks to that time frame, it eliminates the summer 2000 months when prices
first began to spike.

"There is no question we can order refund from that (October) date
forward,"
Wagner said. "Legally, there may be some question before that date."

But Wagner said a FERC regulations may not necessarily rule out broader
refunds. "That's the great thing about a settlement -- you can do anything,"
he
said.

If no settlement is reached in 15 days, Wagner will forward his
recommendations to the full commission for its approval. California will then
have the option of pursuing the matter further in court.

California's delegation will be led by Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer
who chairs the ISO.

Davis also meets today in Sacramento with new FERC Commissioners Patrick
Wood and Nora Brownell to discuss the refunds and the high cost of natural gas
in the state.

Wood, who is expected to be named chairman of the commission in the fall,
has expressed his support for finding solutions to California's power
woes.E-mail the reporters at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com and

HEADLINE: BECHTEL HOLDS ITS OWN;

Despite economic downturn, S.F. construction giant's revenues remain steady

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Todd Wallack

BODY:
The economy is skidding. Tech firms are shutting plants and reining in
expansion
plans. And two major engineering and construction firms, Stone & Webster and
Washington Group (formerly Morrison Knudsen) sought bankruptcy protection
during
the past 13 months.

So, it would come as no surprise to hear that the world's largest
engineering and construction firm, San Francisco's Bechtel Group, is getting
pinched by the downturn.

Only it isn't.

Despite the slowdown in the economy and in some areas of construction,
Bechtel and many rivals are still busy upgrading cellular networks, building
railroads and airports, and completing new power plants.

"Our guys are working 80 to 100 hours a week completing deals," said John
Siegel, vice president of marketing and strategy for Bechtel's power plant
construction division. "You walk around at 9 p.m. and everyone is still here."

Overall, Bechtel's sales dipped 5 percent last year to $14.3 billion, but
that's still up 13 percent from 1999 and a healthy 74 percent from 1996. The
company said operating margins improved last year. And employment jumped by a
quarter during the past five years to 41,000 worldwide, including 1,300 in San
Francisco. Both employment and sales are holding firm so far this year. (The
privately held firm doesn't release earnings figures.)

Bechtel isn't alone. Shares in Fluor, the second-largest engineering and
construction firm, and Jacobs Engineering Group nearly doubled in value during
the past 12 months. And some analysts are bullish on the future.

"We could be on the front end of a multiyear up-cycle," Merrill Lynch
analyst Fritz von Carp predicts.

CONTRARY CYCLES

Although the engineering and construction industry has long been vulnerable
to sharp downturns, von Carp said the cycles often differ from the rest of the
U.S. economy.

For instance, high energy prices usually spell bad news for most domestic
businesses. But an energy shortage could help spur a boom in new power plants,
refineries and pipelines -- lifting the petroleum sector out of a decade-old
funk. That has long been a major business for firms such as Bechtel.

In addition, von Carp points out that government agencies typically garner
a
large share of transportation revenue from gasoline taxes -- which aren't as
sensitive to downturns as income taxes and capital gains. California and other
states have also increasingly walled off those funds, so politicians can't
raid
the transportation war chests to pay other bills when budgets are tight.

Government agencies and big businesses also tend to initiate major projects
when times are good. But because the projects often take years to start and
complete, they often wind up ramping up after the economy has already slid
into
recession. "It is really a late cycle," von Carp said.

This isn't to say that Bechtel's business is humming across the board.

Bechtel Executive Vice President Jude Laspa said sales remain lackluster in
its mining and chemical division. (And despite von Carp's predictions of an
upswing in the petroleum industry, Laspa said sales haven't picked up so far.)

"We have some very robust businesses, and some that are in a cyclical
downturn," Laspa said.

TIGHT MARGINS

Engineering and construction companies also have to be content with lower
profit margins than those in many other industries. Like its rivals, Bechtel
typically pockets about 3 to 5 percent of revenues after taxes, Laspa said.
Operating margins are closer to 7 to 9 percent. (By contrast, anything under
20
percent is considered anemic in the newspaper industry.)

"This is a low-margin business," von Carp said.

Industry players are also increasingly taking on more risk, bidding on
fixed-price contracts to compete. In the past, many firms charged by the hour
and profits soared when projects became mired in delays. Now that companies
are
getting only a lump sum for a development, major setbacks in a project or two
could sink a firm.

Stone & Webster of Boston, for instance, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last year, largely because of delays in building a gas-fired power
plant in Tiverton, R.I. Shaw Group later acquired most of the firm's assets.

Meanwhile, Washington Group of Boise, Idaho, foundered after it acquired
Raytheon's Engineers and Constructors unit, igniting a nasty court battle.
Washington accused Raytheon of concealing problems with several of the
projects
and demanded compensation; Raytheon blamed Washington for mismanaging the
projects and insisted it owed nothing.

Although Bechtel doesn't let outsiders review its books, analysts say they
believe the firm has largely avoided such problems and is financially solid.
Bechtel executives point out that the company is 50 percent larger than its
next-biggest competitor.

"Bechtel is considered in the industry to be the pre-eminent engineering
and
construction company," von Carp said. "It is a very good competitor with a
strong franchise in many markets."

ON TOP IN TELECOM

Bechtel has also enjoyed some luck lately.

For instance, some telecommunications equipment firms are doing so poorly
that one analyst compared it to a "nuclear winter." Dozens of data service
providers, such as NorthPoint Communications in Emeryville, have shut down.
Others have severely reined in their expansion plans.

But Bechtel's revenues are up 20 to 25 percent this year. George Conniff,
president of Bechtel's telecommunications and industrial business unit, said
his
firm mainly serves financially solid firms, such as AT&T Wireless, which are
still going ahead with plans to add 8,000 new towers, despite the slowdown. He
also said the unit has picked up some consulting business abandoned by
equipment
firms trying to narrow their focus to weather the downturn.

"We're having a great year," Conniff said. "When the river is muddy, the
fish start to bite."

But no part of the business is doing as well as Bechtel Power.

A POWERHOUSE IN ENERGY

"The power business is doing spectacular," von Carp said. "It is the
strongest part of the market now, bar none."

Siegel said the company has 22 plants under construction worldwide -- up
from about nine four years ago -- and many more in the pipeline, particularly
in
the United States. Siegel said the unit's revenue rose 15 to 20 percent last
year and is on pace to match that this year. He said the firm could probably
land even more business if it had the ability to pursue and handle more
projects.

Through another unit, Bechtel is also investing in power plants under
development in Hayward, Pittsburg and San Jose. The company struck a deal with
San Jose's Calpine in 1998 to spend $1 billion building several plants in the
Bay Area. Under the deal, the companies will jointly own the plants and split
the profits down the middle. Because of the strong demand for electricity in
California, Bechtel spokesman Jeff Leichtman said it will probably wind up
spending at least $500 million more than originally announced.

Bechtel doesn't own any existing plants in the United States, so it isn't
among those accused of gouging consumers in the recent energy crisis. But
that's
partly an accident of fate.

The firm's investment arm teamed with PG&E in the late '80s to start
building plants. But in 1996, PG&E offered to buy out Bechtel for most of the
U.S. operations; Bechtel sold the rest of its U.S. stakes shortly thereafter.

But Bechtel kept the shares in its overseas plants and bought out PG&E a
year later. Bechtel now operates the foreign plants through a division called
Intergen. It also owns more than half of Nexant, an energy consulting firm
based
in San Francisco.

Now, at a time when many Bay Area firms are being hurt by the energy
crisis,
Bechtel stands to cash in.

And Laspa said word is already leaking out. He said the firm is getting
inundated by resumes. "Potential employees know where the business is strong,"
he said.

HEADLINE: Price cap perils . . . and peripatetics

BYLINE: Donald Lambro; THE WASHINGTON TIMES

BODY:

Republican Whip Tom DeLay couldn't believe what he was hearing at a House
Republican leadership meeting last week after the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission voted to put into place stricter controls on Western electricity
prices.

Almost all of the Republican leaders around the table, who were opposed to
price caps, were happy with FERC's decision because it pulled the political
rug
out from under the Democrats. "The mood around the table was positive. FERC
had robbed the Democrats of a big issue - that we were doing nothing to
control
higher energy prices for consumers," said a Republican House leadership
official
who attended the meeting.

The independent regulatory agency's decision did what President Bush and
Republican leaders had publicly fought but were privately encouraging FERC to
do. While Republican leaders do not believe the price controls will alleviate
California's energy shortage, they were delighted by its immediate political
result. It pricked the price-cap balloon that had been rapidly growing on
Capitol Hill. Price-control Democrats, among them Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California, have withdrawn their price-cap bills while they wait to see if the
agency's action will work.

The administration, which said for months that price controls would only
exacerbate California's energy problems, was nevertheless happy to see the
Democratic offensive collapse. Under advice from political strategist Karl
Rove, Mr. Bush embraced FERC's action, maintaining that it did not impose
price
controls, although everyone knows that is exactly what it did.

Mr. DeLay was not buying the party line, and said so. While he did not
directly criticize the White House's acquiescence - or its behind-the-scenes
lobbying for FERC's action - he put out a strong statement reminding his party
that price controls cannot and will not work.

"Let's be clear," he said. "In every place they've been tried,
big-government price controls have failed to achieve the results their
supporters promised. They failed when Republicans used them. And they failed
when Democratic presidents used them. All government price controls can offer
is the specter of longer and more frequent blackouts."

"The people of California are suffering today because the demand for
electricity exceeds the available supply. Until that fundamental imbalance is
resolved, their problems will continue," he said.

Mr. Bush argued that FERC's order "was not talking about firm price
controls. . . . They're talking about a mechanism to mitigate any severe
price
spike that may occur, which is completely different from price controls."

To which Wall Street economist and columnist Larry Kudlow replied, "Huh?
You
can't be just a little bit pregnant. It's an administration endorsement of
the
FERC ruling. Maybe a soft endorsement, but an endorsement nonetheless."

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's support for FERC's price-control action,
reported in my last column, sounded as if it were "right out of the old East
Bloc planning handbook before the Berlin Wall came down," Mr. Kudlow said in
his
column.

Despite Mr. Bush's embrace of what the White House considers
"regulation-lite," there is widespread unanimity across the political spectrum
that energy price controls will fail.

Listen to what economist Robert Litan of the liberal Brookings Institution
said about them: "Ninety-five percent of economists would say that price
controls are always dumb or that that there should be a very strong
presumption
against price controls. They lead to artificial scarcity and then perpetuate
it."

Richard Nixon imposed price controls on oil in the 1970s to lower gas prices
at the pump, with disastrous results.

The artificially low prices did not reduce consumption, they encouraged it.
They did not lead to more production and supply, they led to less. The price
ceilings "removed incentives for producers to increase supply through less
efficient and therefore more expensive means of production or by expanding
capacity through investment," said a Heritage Foundation memo explaining why
FERC's action won't solve California's energy problem.

"History demonstrates that Nixon's centralized price and allocation
regulatory system led to long gas lines and other problems," the memo said.

California's fundamental problem is that it has not built "the power plants
needed to supply California's energy-hungry economy," Mr. DeLay said in his
memo.

What California needs is not more price controls, but a good dose of
deregulation. Texas and Pennsylvania, which deregulated their energy
industries, enjoy a plentiful supply of electric power. In fact, electricity
prices were already falling in California and around the country long before
FERC acted last w

For those of you that do not know, we are planning
greg's bachelor party for the weekend of May 19th.

We've rented a beach house in Surfside.  The beach
house is front row on the portion of the beach that
allows open fires and automobiles on the beach...both
very cool things.

We have the house Friday night, Saturday, and Sunday.
Jeff, Greg, and I will probably arrive Friday night,
however the main shindig will get kicked off on
Saturday night.  I don't exactly know what the main
shindig is, but we realize that most people won't be
able to pull themselves away from their miserable
lives for an entire weekend.  Jeff, Greg, and I
however, will make sure that the keg is working
properly friday evening.

So what I need from you is a confirmation that you
will:
A - Be there Friday and Saturday
B - Be there Sometime Saturday, Leave sometime
Saturday
C - Be there Saturday, Leave Sunday
D - Can't make it.  Dallas is too far from Surfside.

Cost will be $625 for the house for the entire
weekend.  So depending on how many people we get the
price should be between $60-$100 per person.  Each
person will be responsible for their own food, and a
sleeping bag/pillow, etc.  No linens are provided,
(I'm assuming this means no towels either) but I think
they have a grill so that's the important thing.  Greg
will confirm.

Cards, Dominoes', booze, beach shit, etc.  are other
good items to bring.

We will send specific directions at a later time.

Let me know your status so we can get a better handle
on costs.  I will pass on more info (costs/directions)
as we get it.

Later.

jk

==============================================================================


Per our  conversations on Friday and our discussions with our clients at
Delta today,  attached please find a pdf file that contains a draft timeline
for the  transaction and our comments to the Letter Agreement.

Please note that  many of our comments reflecta change to the structure
whereby the Escrow  Agent would ultimately pay out the ENA fee and the
progress payments to GE under  the Turbine Contract on behalf of the LLC.We
prefer this structure  and believe itdoes not alter the underlying economics
of the deal.  It is also our understanding that Enron has agreed to a
financing condition  precedent to DAL's obligation to make the initial
deposit into the Escrow  Account and our mark-up reflects this understanding.

Regarding the LLC  Agreement, our principal comment is to add an allowance
for a pledge of the DAL  Membership Interest without consent in connection
with third party financing in  Section 6.1(c) thereof. Of course other
changes to conform the Letter  Agreement may be needed as well.

We will provide  additional comments to the draft Guaranty tomorrow; however,
we will expect that  the obligations be capped at specific dollar amount and
that the term of the  Guaranty would end upon the earliest occurrence of any
of the events set forth  in Section 5.3(c) of the Letter Agreement. We will
also need to discuss  changes to the Escrow Agreement in light of our
comments to the Letter  Agreement.

In the interests of  time, we are distributing these commentsbefore
ourclients have had  time to review them. As such, they remain subject to
their further comments and  review. Please feel free to contact John Hawkins
or me with regard to any  of the foregoing. We look forward to discussing our
comments with you at your  earliest convenience.

1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project.

Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on
schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.
PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of
separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon
tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not
create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals,
according to PG&E, are in place.

PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to
discuss maintenance issues with ET&S.

Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in.
pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or
disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E
will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or
dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has
indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce
costs associated with cleaning the pipe.

2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling.

Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at
MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round
of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples
collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to
be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels
north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing
showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has
been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be
collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant
to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is
considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's.

Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The
gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas
Co.  system which is PCB free.

3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency.

West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system
has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these
locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to
have liquids, it is resampled two weeks later and is included into the
sampling program.
Transwestern has requested to PG&E to increase the collection reservoirs
under the meters and valves to allow greater removal liquids from the
pipeline system.  At the present time a small nipple is inserted into the
bottom of the valve and meter body  for the liquids collection.  By
increasing the nipple size,  a greater collection container will be produced.

It was mutually agreed that until installation and operation of the two the
separators, PG&E will continue to sample each location once every two weeks.

4. Review Criteria Used to Determine Need for Tap Filter/Separators.

Originally 29 locations were identified to receive the small filter
separators.  These locations were considered Priority 1 sites.  The
determination of a Priority 1 site is based upon the following criteria:  1)
a location where liquids were collected twice and 2)  ppm concentration of
the liquids collected was > 1.0 ppm.
Based upon these criteria, Ridgecrest and Bakersfield (Kern River Station)
have been added to the list of Priority sites.  Flow through at the Kern
River location is 300-500 mmscf/day.  Samples collected at this location have
shown PCB's in the range of 1-4 ppm.  PG&E's agreement with SoCal at this
location is <1.0 ppm PCB's in the liquid phase.   PG&E has indicated that
there is some sensitivity at both of these locations due to the large volume
of gas deliveries.

PG&E and Southwest Gas have been in discussions concerning 5 additional
filter separators on the Southwest Gas system due to substantial customer
load at these locations.  Southwest Gas feels it needs additional protection
at these sites.  PG&E has stated that Southwest Gas is beginning to express
additional concern for PCB's at their interconnect locations.

5. Review and Discuss List of Proposed Tap Filter/Separators.

a. Siting, Design and Engineering

b. Cost Estimates

PG&E passed out a booklet pertaining to 9 small filter separator sites, plus
an additional sheet for 16 sites with back-up to be produced in the next
week. .  Four of these separators have been installed.  A total of 45 filter
separators may be proposed for installation.

The cost estimates for the additional small volume  F/S up to the 29
indicated at the last meeting is 1.2 to 1.3 million.  The sampling costs have
not been included in this number. Estimates are being reviewed on a per sites
basis as PG&E presented.

One PG&E customer, a cement plant, has inquired about PG&E deconning portions
of their plant that has PCB's.  PG&E is in discussions with the cement
company.   PG&E has informed the cement plant that it will evaluate the
success of the filter separators to be installed on the line feeding the
cement plant prior to committing to any action.  If the deconning occurs, it
will be a 2001 project.

6. Ongoing Consideration of Additional Customer Protection.

Compressor Oil Control.  The majority of liquids collected at strategic
sampling locations is compressor oils.  Transwestern has requested access to
the PG&E C/S to study lube oil systems.  There are 22 compressors at the
Topock and Hinkley C/S's.  Transwestern will conduct a  study of technologies
to assist in reducing oil from entering the pipeline system.  Earl will
coordinate site visits with Glen Riddle.

7. Other Issues or Concerns.

Earl requested additional information on invoices submitted after January,
2000.  rod will send back up and support data of existing invoices sent to
Transwestern.

PG&E is considering increasing gas receipts from Transwestern to 250-300
mmscf/day cap by May 15.  Over time PG&E will look into their C/S
configurations to handle the increased gas flows to 450 mm scf/day.

8. Next Steps.

The next meeting was proposed in 45 days.  This time period will allow
inspection and operation of the mainline filter separators and collection
additional sampling data at new and suspected sampling sites.  The location
of the next meeting was tentatively scheduled for Flagstaff AZ on July 13 as
some of the PG&E meeting attendees will be in Flagstaff during that week on
other business.

Energy Secretary Names Bonneville Head

WASHINGTON, DC -- Department of Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham announced
today the appointment of Steve Wright as administrator of the Bonneville
Power Administration (BPA).  BPA is a federal agency that markets wholesale
electrical power, principally from federal dams in the Columbia Basin, and
operates high voltage transmission for the region.  It is based in Portland,
Oregon, and serves Washington, Idaho, Oregon, western Montana and small
parts of contiguous states.

"Bonneville is extremely important to maintaining a vital economy and
healthy environment in the Pacific Northwest, and I have confidence it will
continue to do so under Steve Wright's direction," said Secretary Abraham.
"Steve exerted outstanding leadership through some of the most turbulent
times for the electricity industry and has effectively worked with diverse
constituencies in the region," added Abraham.

Wright has been with the agency for 21 years, beginning in the agency's
conservation department.  He has served as acting administrator since
November 2000 following the departure of then-Administrator Judi Johansen.
Wright's tenure has spanned some of the region's biggest energy
challenges--including a West Coast energy crisis and the second worst
drought recorded in Pacific Northwest history.

Wright said he was particularly honored to have come through the ranks to
have the opportunity to lead an institution that is critical to meeting the
economic and environmental objectives of Northwest citizens.  "I'm committed
to operating BPA as a sound business enterprise, but one whose mission
starts with meeting our responsibilities to serve the public.  That means
striving for strong environmental stewardship, low rates, reliable service
and being open to the public's ideas about how best to use the assets that
provide so much value to the Northwest," Wright said.

Wright began his work at BPA in 1981 shortly after receiving his masters in
public affairs from the University of Oregon.  Following a stint in the
agency's energy conservation office, he moved to BPA's D.C. office in 1984.
In 1987, he began managing the agency's California office, then went back to
the D.C. office as manager in 1990.  In 1998, he returned to BPA
headquarters in Portland as Corporate senior vice president where he had
responsibility for public affairs; environment, fish and wildlife; finance
and budget; strategic planning; and human resources.  He became deputy
administrator in 2000, followed shortly by his appointment as acting
administrator.

He and his wife, Kathleen, and their three children live in Portland.  In
addition to his  masters, he holds an undergraduate bachelor of arts degree
in journalism from Central Michigan University.  He is 44 years old.

According to the copy of the contract I have, under Exhibit A,
1. The Rebate.  A portion of CDEC's demand charge associated with CDEC's generation fixed costs shall be avoidable by ECS if Customer operates the Compressor such that ECS is able to avoid placing a load on CDEC's system during certain CDEC coincidental peaks for any applicable month.  To calculate the monthly rebate, the actual demand charges as billed by CDEC will be subtracted from the Billing Demand Basis.  The Billing Demand Basis is the maximum demand charge on 10 MW of peak demand, assuming no peak avoidance during the applicable month.  Thus, the Customer's Rebate shall be a portion of the Billing Demand Basis that ECS is not billed by CDEC as actual demand charges.
The way I interpret this wording, we would be entitled to a demand charge rebate even if we only slow down the unit during the peak period.  I've only a copy of last August's bill, but we used 7.93 MW during Tri-States (CDEC's generation) peak.  At $8.86/kW (generation demand), this would entitle TW to a rebate of $18,340 for the month of August alone.  To me it is unclear if TW is actually receiving this rebate.  I've got Mark Walton looking into the issue.  Note that there is an additional "transmission demand" of $3.35 /kW that is coincident with CDEC's peak.  Currently, we have no method of predicting CDEC's peak.  Apparently for the month of August, CDEC's and Tri-State's peaks did not occur at the same time (although there is no specific information on the CDEC bill as to when their demand peak occurred) as the Tri-State peak and CDEC peak demand charges are based on different loads.  Interpretation of the contract language would lead one to believe the rebate would only apply to the demand associated generation, and thus be valued at $8.86/kW.  Even so, if we avoided CDEC's peak, it would be a saving to ECS and thus to Enron.  I understood from James Centilli that the economics were based on avoiding the peak demand 70% of the time (at $8.86/kW or $12.21/kW I don't know).
David, you are correct, we only have to avoid one peak in the month, the problem is predicting which peak is going to be the largest peak in the month.  You don't know for sure on the first day of the month if the load on that day will be higher than the load on the last of the month.  Below is a list Tri-States historical peaks (in MW):
1/3/2000	1114
2/1/2000	1048
3/20/2000	1080
4/3/2000	 977
5/23/2000	1126
6/22/2000	1381
7/7/2000	1888
8/14/2000	1924
9/5/2000	1541
10/23/2000	1296
11/17/2000	1439
12/18/2000	1534
1/30/2001	1516
2/9/2001	1482
3/1/2001	1388
4/22/2001	1251
5/25/2001	1407
6/29/2001	1932
7/31/2001	1939
8/6/2001	2008
9/4/2001	1699
For January 2000 the peak was on the 3rd, in 2001 it was on the 31.  The problem is you don't know for certain which day of the month will have the peak.  The contract did not specify they would only have one peak that they were going to interrupt us on, only that if we avoided their peak (whenever it occurred) we would save in demand charges.
Using the most conservative approach to avoid a demand peak, you would not run at all on the first day of a month (the first day is always a peak day in the month to date). You would only run during the second day when the system load is less than the peak we saw on the first day.  If the system load on the second day is higher than that of the first day, this now becomes the new peak of the month to date.  You would repeat this approach for each subsequent day in the month, shutting down or slowing down for each new peak in the month to date.
The approach I take is a little riskier in that it looks at last years load and 'budget' loads to estimate a 'minimum expected monthly peak'.  It than allows operation of the unit anytime the system load is less than the higher of (1) the actual monthly peak to date and (2) the 'minimum expected monthly peak'.  Thus my utility would let you run for the majority (and possibility all) of the first day and would have fewer peaks during the month than the conservative approach.
You are correct about ECS's obligation in establishing an automated system.  That system has turned into my system.  Sections 3.6 and Article 6 of the contract discuss this topic.  In my mind, ECS did not live up to their end of this agreement.  CDEC didn't do much either, only providing us access to Tri-States web site.  Tri-State changed their web site mid year requiring a change in the automated process (due to file format changes) delaying my implementation.  I offered to take over the automated system sometime around the end of the first quarter this year to force some progress on the issue.  There may me legal recourse available to recover some past demand charges due TW from ECS.
By my calculation/contract interpretation, the maximum rebate TW could receive is $8.86/kW * 10,000kW/Month * 12 Months/Year = $1,063,200/year.

Regulations Under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Governing the
Movement of Natural Gas on Facilities on the Outer Continental Shelf, RM99-5

The final rule is attached - 84 pages



Executive Summary
The Final Rule was issued April 10, 2000 and becomes effective 30 days after
publication in the Federal Register.

The purpose of the final rule is to establish a data base as a foundation for
identifying discrimination with OCS gas service providers.  The reporting
will include affiliations and conditions of service.  This is a procedural
rule - reporting only.  The rule only applies to gas pipelines - FERC found
transportation for oil pipelines to be just and reasonable.  The Commission
is acting in part as a response to the ruling in Sea Robin in which the court
directed FERC to reconsider the manner in which it applied its primary
function test to Sea Robin's predominantly offshore system.

NOPR was issued on June 30, 1999.  The Commission believes that the new OCSLA
reporting requirements mirror certain existing NGA reporting requirements.
Salient points of the final rule are:

Exemptions
Service providers that confine their operations to moving their own gas or
that of a single shipper are exempt from reporting; add new section
330.0(a)(1) and (2)   Note:  reporting exemption turns on identity of service
provider and its shippers - not type of service provided.
Gas service providers that are regulated by FERC under NGA are exempt from
OCSLA reporting; add new section (330.3(a)(4)
Exempts lines that feed into a facility where gas is first collected,
separated, dehydrated or processed from OCSLA reporting requirements; add new
section 330.3(a)(3).

Reporting Requirements
If an NGA-regulated company's system includes OCS facilities that are not
subject to NGA (gathering/production lines), the company must submit an OCSLA
report covering its non-NGA facilities
Reclassified facilities will no longer be subject to NGA reporting
requirements but will be subject to OCSLA requirements. (Shippers  no longer
have protection against the exercise of market power afforded by the NGA).
Service provider must list all of its affiliates defined as engaged in the
exploration, development, production, processing, transportation, marketing,
consumption or sale of gas need be identified in the report; new section
330.2(a)(6)
Reporting Updates restricted to four times per year.
Reports will be based on conditions on the first day of the first full
calendar quarter that begins after the effective date of this rule; reports
due on the first business day after the close of the quarter.  Providers will
have more than one full quarter in which to prepare their initial OSCLA report
Providers will be required to submit a description of their operations as
they stand on the first day of each calendar quarter, e.g. describing the
provider's status on one particular day; report due on first business day of
the subsequent quarter (e.g. filing due April 1 will describe operations as
they stood on January 1).  If the operations are identical on the first and
last days of any given quarter, provider need not submit an update the
following quarter
Not necessary to file contracts but must provide table of shippers and
services; new section 330.2(b)
Retaining requirement for alternative reporting for OCS companies who do not
provide service under formal contracts, must provide information sufficient
to derive rates charged and conditions applicable for service between two
points; new section 330.2(b)(9)
OCSLA Reporting Form available via Internet  http://www.ferc.fed.us or the
public reference room
Providers new to provisions have 90 days to prepare and submit OCSLA report
(NOPR had stipulated 60 days).

The newly formed California Consumer Power and Financing Authority is working to finalize the drafts of three request for bids (RFBs), one for fuel cells, one for micro turbines and one for decentralized photovoltaics. The Authority is bringing the draft RFBs before their board for approval on Nov. 2nd.    To view the draft RFBs click on the following link:

<http://www.capowerauthority.ca.gov/Requestforbids/main.asp>

Created by Senate Bill 6 (Burton), the Power Authority is charged with ensuring reasonably priced, long-term availability of reliable supply of electricity and natural gas, promoting environmentally friendly supply and demand solutions, and achieving adequate capacity reserves by 2006. With its ability to issue up to $5 billion in revenue bond indebtedness, the Authority's five-person Board will look at a variety of options to meet its charge.

The authority's immediate stated intent is to build "a portfolio that combines 1,000 MW of renewable energy with perhaps 2,000 MW of peaking units and load management which the Authority can dispatch at a moments notice will provide the state with the best opportunity to meet capacity needs as soon as summer 2002."

Please let me know if you need more information.  I'll update you with the outcome from the 11/2 board meeting.

NY and NJ
We have finalized the customer scripts for NY and NJ. Attached are the latest drafts with final amendments. Per the below e-mail, I have determined that Enron will not be required to register as a telemarketer in NY. This removes the additional time required to process the registration application and a $25,000 bonding requirement. Barring further amendments today, a clean copy of the scripts will be generated for roll out.

TX
We have finalized the Your Rights as a Customer (YRC) disclosure, the Terms of Service(TOS), and the Electricity Facts Label (EFT) to insure compliance with the specific rule provisions regarding telemarketing. Attached are the latest drafts with final amendments. A clean copy will be generated for roll out.

I also attach the latest timeline for the conclusion of the process.

I have emphasized to relevant business people, that to protect Enron from any rule violations by our outsourced telemarketing agent, we must show that we have established and implemented written procedures, and have trained their personnel to comply. I will be happy to review training materials to insure compliance.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks,
Gloria

Calif Fails To Find Illegal Acts By Generators -Sources
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
(This article was originally published Monday.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- An investigation by California's attorney general
and state utility regulators into alleged illegal behavior by electricity
generators has failed to turn up evidence of criminal activity, persons
familiar with the probe said Monday.
The sources - including two commissioners on the California Public Utilities
Commission and an aide to Attorney General Bill Lockyer - said generators
aren't likely to be prosecuted, even though it appears they did withhold
supply, and that the state may pursue civil remedies as an alternative.
"We have come to the conclusion that this type of behavior is not illegal,"
one PUC commissioner said.
California Gov. Gray Davis was briefed on the investigation Monday night,
spokesman Steve Maviglio said. Maviglio refused to disclose details of the
attorney general's briefing, but said the investigation was ongoing.
"We have not called off the dogs," Maviglio said. "We're still pressing the
attorney general to pursue the investigation."
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on
market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order
substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is
fixed.
PUC President Loretta Lynch said last month that she had enough evidence to
take legal action against generators, but that claim was "premature," another
PUC commissioner said.
The PUC commissioners said the investigation has uncovered evidence that
generators created artificial shortages by withholding supply last summer and
earlier this year, but after dozens of interviews with economists, traders
and power plant employees found no evidence of collusion or other criminal
behavior.
"We do have evidence that they withheld power from the marketplace, that's
documented," one of the commissioners said. "The question is whether that's
illegal, and I don't think it is."
The state is ultimately responsible for soaring power prices, the other
commissioner said, because it passed a flawed deregulation bill.
"The system that we set up requires the generators and marketers, in the best
interest of their shareholders, to do exactly what they have done," the
commissioner said. "Unless they're talking with each other and there is
evidence of absolute colluding, we're not going to get to first base."
The sources said the state may be preparing for a civil lawsuit against Duke
Energy (DUK), Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Mirant Corp. (MIR), Williams Cos. (WMB),
Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) and others, but that too is going to be difficult.
"How do you sue someone for being unethical," the person in Lockyer's office
said.
A spokeswoman for Lockyer wouldn't comment, but said the probe is ongoing.
Spokesmen for the energy companies also wouldn't comment on the
investigation, but said they have submitted bid data and reams of documents
related to how their power plants operate to Lockyer and the PUC. The
generators have repeatedly denied allegations that they acted unlawfully.
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California at Berkeley
Energy Institute, said the state would have a hard time proving otherwise.
"I would not have expected them to find evidence of criminal antitrust
behavior," Borenstein said. Prosecuting generators is "a longshot," he said:
"They would actually have to find a smoking gun and evidence that these guys
were in the same room."
Phil Verlager, an economist specializing in energy issues, said generators
didn't even act unethically, because the setup of California's deregulation
law allowed generators to get away with withholding power.
Even if no smoking gun has been found, tough talk by PUC President Lynch
scared the suppliers, the commissioner said.
"They got the message that they ought to play the game."
Lynch didn't return calls for comment.
Davis said Sunday the recent decline in power prices in the West is a
"function of the extreme pressure on the energy cartel from Sacramento."
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has the responsibility to hold
generators accountable for behavior that produces unjust and unreasonable
prices, even if it isn't illegal, Borenstein said.

Calif Gov:Evidence May Allow Criminal Case Vs Generators
By Jason Leopold
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California investigations have turned up a "growing
body of evidence" that may allow the state's attorney general to pursue
criminal charges against generators suspected by some of manipulating power
prices in the state, the office of California Gov. Gray Davis said Tuesday.
The governor's office didn't detail that evidence, however, and persons
familiar with the probe conducted by the state attorney general and the
California Public Utilities Commission maintained that no such evidence
exists.
"The Attorney General gave the governor a progress report on the status of
civil and criminal actions," Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio said in a
short written statement. "There is a growing body of evidence that may give
the Attorney General the opportunity to proceed with criminal as well as
civil actions."
Attorney General Bill Lockyer briefed Davis Monday night on the status of his
investigation with the PUC into possible criminal antitrust behavior by
generators operating in the state's wholesale electricity market. Maviglio
didn't disclose further details of the investigation.
Two PUC commissioners said the state has documented that supply was withheld,
but hasn't been able to demonstrate such activity was illegal.
"There is no evidence of criminal behavior," one said. "It just doesn't
exist."
S. David Freeman, senior energy adviser to Davis, acknowledged the
distinction Tuesday after being asked by reporters in Washington, D.C., about
allegations generators withheld supply to boost prices.
"It may not be criminal conduct, but it's a crime," he said.
Economists and energy experts deposed by Lockyer have said the attorney
general will have difficulty trying to prosecute generators, because there's
likely no smoking gun.
Any claim that the investigation hasn't turned up evidence of criminal
activity is an "overstatement," Lockyer spokeswoman Sandra Michioku said.
The investigation is ongoing, she said.
Davis said Sunday that pressure from Sacramento has contributed to the recent
sharp decline in power prices in the West. An aide to Lockyer said Tuesday
the attorney general needs to keep alive the perception that he is close to
prosecuting the energy companies "so they will continue to play the game."
The governor, who has repeatedly blamed the state's year-long power crisis on
market manipulation by generators, is pressing federal regulators to order
substantial refunds and impose price caps until the dysfunctional market is
fixed.

Calif Judge To Rule On Confidentiality For Generator Data
06/12/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- A Los Angeles Superior Court Judge said Tuesday he
will issue a written ruling on a lawsuit filed by Reliant Energy Inc. (REI)
against the state's attorney general to prevent confidential subpoenaed
documents from being shared with third parties.
Superior Court Judge George H. Wu said he would take the case under
submission and issue a written ruling in less than 90 days.
Reliant, Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Mirant Corp. (MIR) agreed May 22 to turn over
confidential documents to California Attorney General Bill Lockyer, who is
investigating allegations of manipulation and criminal behavior in the
state's wholesale power market.
Reliant agreed to turn over the information, which includes bid data, as long
as Lockyer's office agreed not to share it with third parties.
Lockyer said last month that he wouldn't share the information pending a
court hearing on the issue.

Once again today I participated in the discussions on possible electricity
legislation held in the offices of Majority Whip Tom DeLay with other
interested parties including industry segments, public power and state
regulators.  The other congressional participants were staff to Reps. Steve
Largent and Chip Pickering.

After meeting all week (except Wednesday), the group was unable to reach an
agreement or even a provisional consensus on what could be placed in an
electricity title that could be added to the comprehensive energy package
that the House Energy and Commerce Committee will begin to process next
week.  Congressional staff will report to their bosses on the status of the
discussions as of this afternoon and from there the Members will determine
whether to proceed further.  There is a general perception that committee
leaders will elect NOT to take up electricty legislation at this time and in
the context of the broader package in the absence of broadly supported
legislation.

In the end, the discussions did not bear fruit because divisions remained
over the usual issues and along most of the usual fault lines.  As the drafts
progressed during the week, we succeeded in deleting the original language
that would have had Congress weigh into the bundled/unbundled and
federa/state jurisdictional rules at the very time that likely adverse action
in Congress could in turn adversely impact the Supreme Court case.

A last minute attempt was made by the congressional staff to stitch together
a minimalist electricity title that would have included reliability (with the
understanding that the NERC discussions could produce modifications more to
our liking), PUHCA repeal, PURPA reform, interconnection language and federal
siting.  However, in each instance there were one more politically relevant
interest groups not willing to go along.  Cong. DeLay's staff also tried to
link PUHCA repeal to those who had joined an RTO.

There was also an attempt to strip it down to reliability, interconnection
and siting (eminent domain) -- but again there was either disagreement on the
details or objection from those who favorite subject was left out of the
minimalist package.

There was one rather interesting discussion when the public power folks
floated language on market power that included a sentence that would have
made the filed rate doctrine inapplicable to antitrust challenges to market
rates.  Needless to say, I strongly objected as did EPSA and others.

As noted, the lack of an agreement reduces our exposure when the mark up
occurs.  In the absence of an electricity title, refund, price control and
other issues should not be germane to the package that the subcommittee will
take up on Tuesday and the full committee next Friday.  That package will
have five issues addressed: conservation, clean coal, hyrdo, nuclear and
reformulated gasoline.  Details to follow once legislative language is
released.

Here is a snapshot of what is going on right now.  It is unusual.
According to ISO, they owe us $1MM (instead of us owing them $37MM)!!!!!
However, don't take this to the bank since Jan Acton of Charles River Associates believes that the ISO made a significant "coding" (ie mathematical formula) error with respect to uninstructed energy, that is behind most of this shift.  On the conference call held Monday, others also noticed discrepancies in the uninstructed energy category so it is likely the ISO will discover and fix the error.
We suspect there is game playing going on (in addition to errors in the data).  CERS went from having to refund $1.2billion, to zero.  Also, significant increases (unexplained) in neutrality charges have been observed.
ISO asserts their calculations are correct despite the suspected errors and game playing.  However, they have not taken mitigation into account for "spot OOM" transactions.  The magnitude of this is unknown, but could be very large.  This makes the correctness of their data even more suspect.
Obviously, given the foregoing no one can agree to limit the scope of the proceeding through a stipulation excluding settlement disputes from the proceeding.  The numbers are huge as are the shifts or swings in liability with each iteration of new ISO numbers.
Absent agreement on the stipulation, Judge Birchman is scheduled to hear oral argument and decide the issue tomorrow.
Our main concern will be to keep consideration of issues 2 and 3 (refunds and offsets) together in the procedural schedule.
I am meeting with Dan Watkiss at noon to discuss strategy, and Gary Fergus will also be coming in for the hearing.  Another conference call with the ISO regarding their data will take place at 2PM.  I will follow up with another e-mail so as to keep you posted.

Thank you.
_______________________________________________________________
We appreciate your assistance in providing the responses to the
environmental questions regarding Gleason and the SPCC issue referenced on
the draft schedules.  The following questions are still outstanding,
however, from October 23 and October 25 despite your indication that the
responses to at least the October 23 questions would be available last
week.   Given the fast approaching bid deadline and the importance of the
responses to our due diligence review, we would appreciate receiving the
responses as quickly as possible.  For your convenience, the following is
the list of our outstanding questions:
Questions for All Facilities
1.  What are the limitations on the number of hours that each facility can
operate and what is the source of those limitations?
2.  We understand that there are tentative expansion plans for each
facility.  Were these future expansion plans disclosed to the regulating
agencies at the time that the air permits were applied for, particularly at
those facilities which did not undergo PSD review?
3.  Which facilities are required to perform continuous emissions
monitoring pursuant to its air permits?  For those facilities performing
CEM, please provide the last two years of data.
4.  Are the facilities FERC jurisdictional for environmental impact
statement purposes pursuant to 18 C.F.R. Part 380?  We noticed that the
only facility with information about this issue was the pipeline at
Lincoln, although the information seemed to suggest that only the pipeline
was subject to the EIS process.  See 2.02.12.G.  Was the rest of the
Lincoln facility subject to the EIS process?  What was the outcome of the
EIS process for the pipeline?
5.  What is Enron's understanding of the process required to transfer the
environmental permits for each facility in connection with the proposed
transaction?  For example, the 1995 stormwater permit for LV Cogen appears
to be triggered by a change in control of the facility.  See 6.02.03 at
page 16.  Do other permits have similar provisions?
6.  Will any environmental property transfer or comparable statutes (e.g.
the Illinois Responsible Property Transfer Act) be triggered by the
proposed transaction?
7. We have reviewed the United States Environmental Protection Agency
comments for the air permit at LV Cogen II, as discussed below.  Did U.S.
EPA provide any additional comments on the air permits for LV Cogen II or
any other facility?
Lincoln Facility
1.  Does the Lincoln facility have an air operating permit from the
Illinois Environmental Protection Agency?  If so, please provide a copy.
If not, please explain status.
2.  Were any wetlands impacted by the construction of the facility and, if
so, what permits were obtained?  Will any wetlands be impacted by future
expansion plans?  ENSR's conclusion on this issue seemed unclear,
particularly with respect to the 30 acre parcel.  See 02.03.09C.
Wheatland Facility
1.  We understand that the Wheatland facility may seek a NPDES permit to
discharge wastewater directly to the White River.  How is this wastewater
currently managed?  Why is the facility considering changing the management
method to direct discharge under a NPDES permit?  If there are associated
cost savings with a NPDES permit, what are they estimated to be?  We
understand that the source of the water that is discharged is a pond
associated with mining operations.  Who is the owner of the pond?  Are any
water extraction permits needed to remove water from this pond and, if so,
have they been obtained?  We also understand that sampling was recently
performed of the water.  Please provide copies of this analysis and any
associated documentation.
LV Cogen
1.  The Industrial User Discharge Permit on Dealbench appears to have
expired on July 1, 2000.  See 6.02.02.  Was it renewed?  If so, please
provide copy.
2.  The stormwater discharge permit for LV Cogen appears to be expired.
See 06.02.03.  Was it renewed?  If so, please provide copy.
3.  Does Sunco hold any environmental permits in its own name?  If so,
please provide copies.
LV Cogen II
1.  EPA contends in its March 23, 1998 and March 24, 2000 letters that BACT
for LV Cogen II was SCONOx and/or XONON.  See 06.01.09.1.   How was this
issue resolved?  Can LV Cogen II meet the 2 ppm NOx limit in the draft
operating permit with the technology that has been proposed?  See 06.01.15.
2.  It appears that the State of Nevada has contended that certain
equipment replacement should have undergone new source review in their June
13, 2000 memo.  See 16.03.6.    How was this resolved?  What is EPA's view
on this issue?
Schedules for LV Cogen I and II
1.  Schedule 4.1(i) references an annual audit of the CEM system in May
2000.  Is this audit on Dealbench and/or can we get a copy of it?
2.  Please provide a copy and/or reference to a Dealbench document for the
Phase I referenced on Schedule 4.1(n).
3.  Please provide copies and/or references to Dealbench documents for the
items listed as 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 on Schedule 4.1(u).  [Note that we have
reviewed the 1995 storm water permit, but did not see an indication that it
is automatically renewed.  Is this reflected elsewhere?]

I have had a casual chat with some of my accounts regarding their opinion of
the market dynamics affecting the Needles to Topock price differentials.
Each customer focused more on the supply side dynamics of Topock gas
supplies, rather than the incremental intra-state transport costs required to
transport to the PG&E citygate, as the primary driving force for the Needles
to Topock  price differential.

Here is a recurring theme I heard from my customers:  The El Paso Merchant
Service (EPMS) 1.2 BCF contract's Block II capacity (500 MMcf/d of Permian to
PG&E/Topock capacity,  $.065 transport rate) has a re-callable aspect.  If
EPMS schedules gas under the transport of Block II capacity to any other
California delivery point other than PG&E/Topock, then other parties may
recall the capacity for their own use to PG&E/Topock.  Currently Duke has
recalled 100 MMcf/d and PG&E Energy Trading has also recalled 100 MMcf/d for
their use to transport Permian gas to PG&E/Topock. (FYI - EPMC may re-recall
this capacity, but they have elected not to).  These additional Topock
supplies coming from Duke and PG&E Energy Trading under Block II capacity may
be viewed as providing an oversupply of gas to PG&E at Topock.  This gas
competes head to head with Malin gas prices.  For example, today's Malin
price is $4.62 while PG&E/Topock price is $4.69.    Today's cash price
differential between Needles and Topock is $.60, far larger than the
previously assumed $.28 differential resulting from the intrastate cost
required to bring Topock gas to the citygate.

If anyone else had additional market information or opinions regarding these
market dynamics, let's discuss further at our next staff meeting. CS

Attached please find a copy of volumes delivered to  Columbia Energy Services
for March 1 thru March 9, 2000.  I downloaded this directly from Michcon's
system  and the actual volumes Columbia received at each meter point is in
the ADJ NOM VOLUME column.  It is broken out in what was delivered in dth and
what was delivered in mcf.    I have also added a column to show the
difference between what was delivered in dth vs mcf.

We had numerous problems with nominations on Michcon's system for the dates
of 3/2 thru 3/7, however Tom Butzon with Michcon worked very hard to make
sure that all of our markets were kept whole.   After reviewing deliveries to
CES per Michcon's system this is the breakout per day:

Per CES Request  Per Michcon  Difference
3/1/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/2/00   11,417    11,240   (177)
3/3/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/4/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/5/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/6/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/7/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/8/00   11,417    11,417   0
3/9/00   11,450    11,450   0


I spoke with Tom this afternoon regarding the cut on 3/2/00 and he cannot go
back and reallocate that point.    Regarding the increase for 3/8/00 it is
imperative that Donna calls us to let us know that she sent an email due to
the fact that we do not always have time to check email in time to get the
gas put in the position for the next day.  Also in the event that someone is
out and that person cannot check their email, a simple telephone call to the
scheduler would help tremendously.

Reqarding Doug's letter dated 3/7/00 regarding insufficient volumes at
acceptable points for the Michcon Select Program, it is my understanding that
a volume of 7,300 mcf is the requirement CES has to the Select Program.  On
the attached spreadsheet I have broken out the points Enron delivered gas to
CES on the acceptable points and we have met those requirements every day
with the exception of 3/8 and 3/9 where Enron shorted CES volumes at required
Map #'s by 272 mcf.  This was due to late changes we received by our
suppliers.   If CES did incur penalties on 3/1 thru 3/7 then CES needs to
look at how they are allocating each point since certain points are to be
delivered to the Select Program first.   When CES receives all their points
for the day they should first allocate the SELECT points to their SELECT
customers, the remaining points  can then be divided up between their other
non specific customers.   I apologize for the confusion but I believe we have
made a valiant effort to keep CES whole at the proper points as best we
could.



Should you have any questions, please call me at 713-853-9138.

Dear Board Members:

Lekha and I are hosting a Customer Appreciation Dinner at my house and
would like to invite you and your spouse.  The dinner is by special
invitation to our top 100 customers.  It is scheduled the evening of our
Board Meeting, Wed., 24 Oct at 7pm.  The next morning we will have our
Five.Two presentation.  You are invited to attend any of these functions.

Please let me know if you are able to attend.  We would be happy to arrange
any transportation/hotel that you may need.

Regards,
Sanjiv


Below is portion of a sample invitation sent to our customers:

These past few weeks have been an intense time filled with tragedy and
challenge, as well as an amazing spirit that has reminded us of how much we
all have to be thankful.

As you know, we postponed PLANET2001 after consulting with a number of our
customers and partners whose companies have imposed travel restrictions.
The decision to postpone PLANET2001 was an exceedingly difficult one to
make, because so many of us at i2 value the time to meet with our valued
customers. But as we made our plans to postpone PLANET to next spring, we
realized that we had an unprecedented opportunity in front of us right now
an opportunity to say ?thank you? to you -- the very people that have been
our long-term partners and customers.

I would like to personally invite you and your team to an exclusive
recognition event and celebration created for our best customers.  On
October 24th and 25th, if you are free to travel to Dallas, we?d like to
have you join us for i2 Customer Days. With current travel restrictions, I
understand if you cannot join us in person, but I hope you will be able to
join us for the live Webcast on October 25th.

We?ve designed this interactive forum to recognize the world?s best
practice leaders in the industry, to give you the first look at i2?s
exciting new upgrade, and for you to meet and give one-on-one feedback to
our executives and software developers to enhance and improve i2?s
solutions.  In addition, we will host breakout sessions where such
customers as Jacob Scherer, Executive Director of Telcordia Technologies,
and Shane Nicholson, Director of Tokyo Electron, will present their
pioneering work in value chain management.

Starting at 1:30 p.m. on Wednesday the 24th, we?d like you to join us for
the official launch of our Ken Sharma Center of Excellence at One i2 Place
where you can hear presentations and meet with i2 product teams. At 4:00,
we?ll break for a special celebration, the Ken Sharma Best Practice Awards,
honoring many of you who have shown the world what it means to be the best
something i2?s late co-founder, Ken Sharma, believed in passionately. Later
that evening, you are invited to join our co-founder and Chairman Sanjiv
Sidhu and his wife Lekha Singh at their home for a private dinner.

The following morning on the 25th, we?d like to give you the opportunity to
preview i2?s breakthrough upgrade i2 Five.Two with an entirely new look and
feel designed for ease of use, as we launch it during the live Webcast
around the world.  We hope you can join us in the afternoon, where you will
have the chance to hear other customers and meet with i2 product teams and
executives.  We?ll finish with a reception later that afternoon.

I do hope you can join us for this special celebration. My assistant,
Corinne Neff, will be taking RSVPs from our guests.  She can be contacted
directly at 469-357-4880 or by email at corinne_neff@i2.com. I look forward
to the opportunity to say thank you for all that you?ve done for i2.

Sincerely,

A. Katrina Roche
Chief Marketing Officer

Last week you all received a memo from Brent Price which described changes
within Gas Operations, excluding Texas.  Attached is an organizational chart
for the Texas region.

We too continue to look for efficiencies to ensure we meet the demands of our
customers.  We currently support the Texas trading region, Bammel Storage
Facility, Houston Pipeline, Powder River Gathering and Bridgeline.  I am
pleased to announce that we will also combine Risk Management, Deal
Validation and Operational Analysis under the management of Steve Venturatos
who will serve as the Business Controller.  Dave Baumbach will fill the Lead
position.  Ami Chokshi will move from Trading Support to the new group,
continuing in the role of the Entex and TUFCO account manager.  Jody Crook
also will join the team.  Bryan Hull will transition his knowledge over the
next month, and will be moving to has second rotation, effective 6/5/00.
Additionally, Will Kelly will transition the Denver trading books to the
Texas team as he moves to the East Region.  Transportation Management under

Yesterday afternoon, September 17, the Judge in the Northeast RTO mediation proceeding issued his report to the Commission on the 45-day mediation session.  Although not unexpected, but still disappointing, the Judge endorses the market design proposal of the New York and New England ISOs.  This market design proposal encompasses a long, drawn out process for discussing what the Northeast market should look like (minimum 12 months) before work begins to develop the new RTO.  The target implementation date of the ISOs is November, 2004, but the proposal clearly states that this time frame is "subject to extension" if new design requirements are introduced.  We believe the true intent of the ISOs is to delay indefinitely this process in order to retain the three existing ISO structures.  A copy of the Judge's report and the Business Plan are attached.

One good aspect of the Judge's report is that he asks in several areas of the report for Commission guidance.  We too believe this is necessary.  It became quite evident early in the mediation proceeding that we were not going to agree with the New York entities (or the New England ISO) on market design or governance.  We argued that FERC intended the new market design to be primarily the PJM system, with enhancements where possible.  Others, relying on the ambiguity in FERC's orders, argued that FERC really intended to create a new system, using PJM as the platform but pulling heavily from the other two ISOs, regardless of time or complication of creating this new market.  We need FERC direction on this, and the Judge makes this clear.

Background

The Judge's primary goal of this 45-day mediation process was simply to establish a "business plan" which lays out how and when a single Northeast RTO will be created.  Enron, along with many other participants, opposed this approach, arguing that we are wasting the 45 days given to us by the Commission.  The Judge acknowledges in his report that there was significant opposition to his approach but he thinks it worked out perfectly.  Although the majority of the Judge's report and the business plan focuses mainly on process for creating the business plan, he does discuss two substantive issues:  market design and governance.

Market Design

At the beginning of the mediation, PJM, NY and NE submitted a joint proposal for forming a single Northeast RTO.  This proposal envisions a time-intensive approached designed to reach agreement by all stakeholders, with an implementation date in 3-4 years ("Option 1-M"of the Business Plan).  This proposal is now supported by the New England and New York ISOs - PJM has its own approach (see below).  The New York transmission owners also submitted a proposal for implementing the new RTO in 3 years ("Option 2-M" of the Business Plan).   PJM submitted an alternative proposal for creating and implementing a single Northeast RTO with a single day-ahead and real-time energy market by November 2003 ("Option 3-M" of the Business Plan).

We took the lead in creating a coalition of marketers, generators, PJM TOs, industrials, and other end use customers (The One RTO Coalition) advocating the creation of a single energy market based on PJM's system by December 2002, but no later than May, 2003.  Although we (Enron) believe PJM's November 2003 time frame is too conservative, the coalition supports Option 3-M (PJM's approach) since it achieves the Coalition's goals, albeit on a slower timetable.

As noted above, the Judge endorses Option 1-M, in part because it has a built-in a process for determining "Best Practices."  Although PJM also conducted a "best practices" analysis, the other ISOs and NY TOs do not agree with PJM's determinations of what practices from their ISOs are "best practices."

The Judge acknowledges that support for Option 3-M (the PJM plan) "far outstrips" the other options in diversity and extent of stakeholder support.  However, the Judge believes that the PJM option assumes the PJM platform can work in New York and New England, even though there are more generation divestiture and load pocket issues in New York and New England than in PJM.  The Judge states that "impatience, haste and greed" should not be permitted to drive the RTO process "at the expense of sound policy" and that optimal RTO benefits should not be sacrificed in order to allow some to "exploit more immediate economic opportunity in a sprint." See Report, page 18.

Governance

The other substantive issues we have discussed are governance:  interim governance, final governance, board make-up and stakeholder process.  The Judge opted to not endorse any one of the options proposed - instead, he discusses the pros and cons of each option.  Here again, the Judge strongly urges the Commission to provide guidance to the participants on the Commission's preferred governance approach.  The Judge also suggests that a settlement judge may be helpful in assisting stakeholders in finalizing governance procedures.

PJM has stated that in order to meet its deadline of November 2003 (and certainly earlier), PJM has to be in control of the implementation of the new RTO.  PJM proposes that the new board be made up of board members from the existing ISOs:  5 from PJM, 3 from New York, and 2 from New England.  The Board elects a voting CEO (assumed to be Phil Harris if the PJM proposal wins).

NY ISO, New England ISO, NY PSC, NY TOs and New England TOs, along with other entities (primarily those who are afraid to cross New York PSC) all support equal representation on the new Board.  One proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with a non-voting CEO.  The other proposal would have 3 board members from each ISO with 4 additional board members to be elected by stakeholders.

We support the PJM board make-up proposal to ensure a fast transition to a single Northeast RTO and energy market based on the PJM system.

Post Mediation

The Judge in his report recommends that the Commission issue an order resolving as many of the issues in dispute as possible and then establish further proceedings under the auspice of a settlement judge.

The Judge urges the Commission to not accept comments from participants, but he acknowledges that all participants want an opportunity to comment.  We are working on two sets of comments now, one on our own and one in conjunction with the One RTO Coalition.  We will circulate drafts as soon as they are prepared.

Although we are disappointed that the Judge did not endorse the PJM proposal, we still believe that the Commission is intent on implementing a single northeast RTO as soon as possible and that the PJM proposal provides a well-reasoned (even conservative) approach to reaching that goal.  Therefore, even though the Judge sided with New York, we are hopeful that the Commission will stick to its guns and go with the PJM proposal.

Please call any one of us if you have any questions or would like to discuss the Report.

Sarah, Dan, Howard and Tom

Dear All,

Sally's recommendation to include Joannie is necessary to make sure
everyone
knows "The Plan" for the Enron board dinner and any other future
Enron/Lay
joint function that Ken and I might host.  Let's set a meeting date
for near
future.  A party check list needs to be made and agreed on by all.
Below
are some outstanding items that need to be addressed:

1.	Invitation list beyond board members and spouses.  (KLL
needs to
determine this ASAP.)
2. 	Decide on a consistent "Theme" that will tie everything
together.  (I
am leaning toward "Patriotic.")
3. 	Choose an invitation from Events.
4.	Decide on a holiday gift for board members. (Received
great gift ideas
from Tori and Barb; Ken and I will 			decide on
something this weekend.)
5. 	Spouse gifts are on hold.  (It's a Radko ornament
w/proceeds going to
terrorist relief effort.  Sally, send an e-		mail attachment
copy to
everyone to see.)
6. 	Choose appropriate paper and ribbon for gift wrapping.
7.	Choose two separate items for males and females to pick
that will
determine their respective dinner table.
8. 	Decide on table cloths, overlays and napkins.
9. 	Decide on table centerpiece arrangements.
10.	Decide on other floral/holiday items needed.
11.	Decide on tree decorations.
12.	Pick a caterer and menu. (Maybe ask three caterers for
menu
suggestions, pick the best from each and have them 		prepare
the entire meal
for a committee to decide.)
13.	Decide on what the pre-party lobby entertainment should
be and reserve
it.
14.	Confirm whether Sally has reserved the piano player, Bob
Henchen (Sp?).
15. 	Decide on Father Christmas and reserve him.

Thanks, Linda

Greetings All!
As most of you know, there is a Trader Web-site project initiative currently
in progress to identify specific reports that traders have produced every day
and to then automatically publish these reports to a web-site.
We are in the initial stage of collecting requirements from the traders
(identified by Steve Stock) to determine what reports and report information
are to be submitted for publishing on a web-site.  Based on these
discussions, the requirements listed below have been identified so far.
Please review these requirements and let me know if you have any changes or
additional requirements by EOB Tuesday, March 6.  Also, please forward all
report templates, required report information, and security requirements for
your region.  If you are not be able to provide this information by next
Tuesday, please let me know.
Trader Report Web-site Requirements:
1. Need a separate web-site developed and implemented (in the same manner
that the Executive Report Viewer project, which is   being handled by Zhiyong
Wei's team)
2. Web-site to be available 24 hours a day X 7 days a week
3. There are 5 Risk Regions: East, West, Central, Texas, and Financial
4. Each person leads a region as follows:
Kam Keiser   / East Risk Region
Darron Giron   / West Risk Region
Phillip Love  / Central Risk Region
David Baumbach  / Texas Risk Region
Errol McLaughlin / Financial Risk Region
5. Jeff Gossett is the Project Lead for Traders
6. There are several traders within each region
7. Security -  All traders should have access within their own region.
Security will need to be set up to only view each trader's  respective region
(or any additional regions identified).  Security requirements need to be
defined and documented by  each region lead, listing the name of each person
that will be able to view what particular region/s reports.
8. All reports are currently in Excel and need a macro to export to the new
web-site (formulas are within the spreadsheets).   Required reports are to be
identified by each region lead, with sample report templates.
9. A total of 15 reports are needed now and need more room for additional
reports to be added in the future
10. Reports are to be automatically exported daily (reports are run each
night) and to be published with "view only" capabilities on  the web-site
11. History - Need to maintain 30 days of history, and also every last day of
each month beginning (starting from) 1/01/01 and  forward
I will be meeting with Zhiyong next week to discuss these requirements, and I
will schedule project meetings as needed going forward.
Please contact me if you have any questions or need additional information.
Thank you for your input and support!!

Below is the transcript of an interview conducted yesterday with State Treasurer Phil Angelides:

Summary:
Bond Issuance to be $10B with 10-15 year term, 70% tax exempt and 30% non-exempt
Angelides in favor of wind fall profit tax
Opposed to current discussion between Davis and Socal in regards to Socal paying off the generators over 12 years with a 2-year grace period

What decisions on rate components are necessary before you can sell bonds?
"The big things we need are that the PUC must enter into agreement with DWR, essentially warranting that sufficient revenues from rates will be available for purchasing power. It is really their job to define what each party needs to pay for power. We need to give assurance to the investment community that whatever the overall rate is, the state will get enough to pay its bonds. However, if the utilities challenge the decision, it could stall the bond issuance."
What do you think will be the size of the first bond issue?
"Based on what is currently possible and what the legislature has authorized, around $10bn. The PUC has allowed us to sell north of  $13bn, but we anticipate that $10bn is absorbable. Until the administration provides details for this office and the public on what its costs of buying power are and what it needs in terms of funding, what will drive it is that number, not what the PUC has said. The issuance may well be a single $10bn issue or a series of smaller ones done together, e.g. $3bn each 3 weeks apart."
What is the total size of the market for CA tax-exempt bonds?
"What we do normally is $5-10bn in bonds for various revenues or general obligations. In 1997 the CA infrastructure rate reductions bonds was a $7bn issuance, and this was handled well.  This is not exclusively a CA market.  Around $200bn of these bonds is sold each year.   We anticipate that the bonds will be 70% tax-exempt and 30% non-exempt."
What is the total of electric supply contracts that are firm enough to require funding?
"We have estimates. The DWR is buying power, and let's say power costs $100 and its portion of rates is $70. This bond issuance covers the diff between $100 and $70. So, the bond issuance is a way to cover the gap. However, if power prices do not come down, you cannot keep borrowing.  If we issue more than $10bn in bonds, I have to see the whole financial plan.  (The implication is that he will not keep this plan secret.)"
What will be the term mix of the bond issues?
"Overall term is expected to be in the 10-15 year range.  I do not know the mix."
Do you have the ability to do bridging tax anticipation notes or anything like that to take care of the general fund?
"The very purpose of the bridge loan is that we are taking a taxable and tax-exempt bridge loan until bonds are issued.  In order for us to issue bonds, a number of steps have to occur. I would hope that the PUC and DWR do what they have to do realistically by June.  Then the bond issuance would come semi all-at-once.  (In other words, either all at once, or something like $3 billion every three weeks.)"
Are all of the general funds' assets in cash, or are some in the form of a less liquid receivable?
"We have a lot of liquidity in real cash in general fund.  We have a cash flow. We have the ability in pooled money investment accounts so that we can go out to five years. We have $40bn-plus in that account."
What is the minimum working capital required in the general fund for day-to-day operations?
"It depends, and goes up and down.  On any given day we are doing on the order of $500mm. There is a $100bn budget between the general funds and special fund."
Are you discussing the DWR contracting in relation to the required funding? Do you have a veto on the deals struck?
"This is all in the administration's court.  What we have asked for is the information.  We have asked for this today by letter.  We have to move from working with 3 or 4 banks to a public offering, which means public disclosure.  The general fund has been making advances to buy power, but we want to get out of that business and to stop the $4bn plus drain on general fund from arranging an interim loan."
What is the credit risk from industry or other large users cherry picking or self-selecting?
"There are limits on the options out there.  AB1X has limited the ability of people to opt out of the system.  If you do allow them to opt out, what do they have to pay to preserve the revenue stream? The agreement between the DWR and the PUC will say that, through a financing order, we will get you the revenue to service the bonds, even if it adjusts rates.  This will be a covenant that the money will be made available."
If an initiative is launched could it create enough uncertainty to have an effect on ABIX or the bond issuance? What about "Harvey proofing"?  What is the direct state participation?
"The state's role is infrastructure and economic development.  Bonds will be issued in name of DWR only to pay for power the state is buying, not to repay utility deb.  I don't think the state will repay utility debt.  The state can buy power in or out of Chapter 11.  There will be no participation by the state bank.  I know Harvey well, and he and I agree on a number of things.  For example, I am cosponsoring the public power authority. We should not put the state in the business of refinancing utility debt.  I don't think most consumer groups realize that we are selling bonds to pay for power.  I very much want, and it is in my interest, to repay the general fund.  At the same time that this office is financing the purchase of energy, the fundamental problem is the price we are being charged by the generators-the ransom that is being demanded by the generators. I agree with Harvey that as of this current time the generators are winning.  We will have to consider excess profits taxes, or if the generators continue, they have increased their prices tenfold.  The generators they bought a set of plants for $3.1bn.  Since January the state has spent over $4bn.  If the generators don't take their foot off our throat, they may leave us no option but to take back plants under emergency power.   So let them justify those rates.  What causes the problem is the generators jacking up prices to the point where they will make us do something about it."
What is the "measurable size premium" that will have to be paid based on the most current estimates of bond issue size?
"Measurable is the wrong choice of words.  We don't know how many basis points. If it is more than $10bn, we will begin to feel it.
Also, I am not for that proposal to allow the utilities to pay off the generators over 12 years with a 2-year grace period. They should work that out themselves, not on the backs of ratepayers.  The perspective here is that they did very, very well in 1996, 97 and 98.  They upstreamed billions."

Here is my draft answer to the questions posed by one of the banks.  I am still chasing down some data, but wanted the group editing with me.  Would you please review ASAP so I can get up to Wes.  Keep in mind, these are the responses to Jeff M., not necessarily what they should or will share with the bank.  I think we should give them all the data points and let them judge what is disclosed.
1.  What effect of global slow down?  We believe that the current economic environment provides a good opportunity for RES given customers' desires to reduce/fix their exposure to commodity price volatility and meet budget and liquidity needs.
2.  How much of new business is tied to customer capital investment? To be sure we address the intent of this question we have three types of capital investment (i) Expenditures by customers - no new origination activity is contingent on customer capital expenditures (ii) RES internal capital expenditures - the only internal capital expenditures are approximately $10-15MM in Q4 2001 and $60MM in 2002 in IT capital expenditures (iii) We have, as part of our PRM Liability, forecasted expenditures for equipment at existing customer locations as part of our Demand Side Management (DSM) business.  For the next six months these expenditures total $______.   If not spent on schedule we would "lose" PRM asset value of approximately $____MM from loss of savings to be generated from these investments.
3.  What effect on business of CA decision to terminate retail access? Although unable to initiate new contracts within California, we believe that the renewal of existing contracts within Califonia will offset any losses experienced in that market and with the anticipated market openings across North America (especially Texas and Ontario in early 2002) there will be no negative impact to RES' growth.  Excluding California, approximately 26% of the retail electric market is open representing a total market size of approximately $56.1 billion.
4.  What is impact if order made retroactive? None, all contracts put in place have change of law provisions with liquidated damage language to protect RES' exposures.
5. What effect does slowing electric deregulation have? The pace of deregulation across the United States is uneven, however planned openings in 2001-2003 are adequate to meet RES near-term goals.  The California crises has increased customers' urgency in the marketplace and has reduced RES' customer acquisition costs.  Continued deregulation is important to our long-term strategy.  To counter the effect of the slowdown we have increased our product offering of Demand Side Management activities which bring value to RES and our customers in regulated environments.
6.  What is credit exposure to utilities, PX, ISO - if still can't get numbers is exposure changing, what about Retail direct access credit receivables.  What of ENE's $580 in receivables is "Allowable" - how much is contested?  We currently have approximately $_____ MM in "PX" receivable from utilities ($____ MM from PG&E and $_____ MM from SCE).  EPMI has a $____MM receivable from the California ISO.  PG&E is contesting $_____MM of our recorded receivable and SCE is contesting $____MM.  We have a total reserve of $_____MM established for these items.

All;

Attached for your review is a draft memorandum from the ENE OTC to employees on the upcoming year-end 2001 process, specifically addressing clarifications to the process and highlighting changes as a result of the Lay-it-on-the-Line survey .

The memo is intended to demonstrate the three components that comprise the review process: feedback and evaluations, talent discussions and bonus, and provides you with choices on how you wish to proceed for YE01.  For example, doing all three in the above order, or alternatively  feedback/ bonus and thereafter talent discussions or  feedback and bonus only.      Please note that this memo would not be sent to EEL - since EEL is administering their review process  slightly differently (i.e. it is not holding meetings at year-end).

In conjunction with the ENE memo we have also prepared a draft template for each business unit/function to use in communicating  the details and  mechanics of their process to their employees.      The purpose of this template will be to enumerate the choices each Business Unit/Function has in administering their processes - feedback and evaluations, talent discussions and bonus process.

We look forward to your comments.

Thank you,

Gina Corteselli
Global Performance Management

ChemConnect and Envera Announce Merger; Leading Online Marketplace for Chemicals and Plastics and Major Industry Consortium Join Forces, Heralds New B2B Era
06/07/2001  Business Wire

Offering the only complete e-commerce solution for buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics worldwide, ChemConnect Inc. and Envera today announced they have merged. The agreement between ChemConnect, operator of the World Chemical Exchange, a dynamic online marketplace supported by strategic e-commerce services, and Envera, a leading global electronic network for chemical and petrochemical industry B2B supply chain transactions and services, is effective immediately. Dedicated solely to creating value for buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics, the merged company offers increased efficiency, cost optimization, and improved collaboration with existing and new business partners across the entire supply chain, from prospecting to fulfillment and settlement.

"ChemConnect is the leading online marketplace for chemicals and plastics. Envera offers unparalleled supply chain integration. Together, we create the first online Marketplace Plus that offers a flexible, modular approach to accommodate different stages of adoption," said John Robinson, ChemConnect CEO, who will now serve as CEO of the merged entity. "Combining our complementary strengths and shared vision, we will have an unbeatable solution: A seamless connection to the entire workflow, from identifying new business partners to fulfillment. It's what our Members told us they want, and with this merger, we are making it all available."

ChemConnect and Envera will offer their Members unmatched, online global buying and selling opportunities, supported by end-to-end connectivity and collaboration--including sales, logistics, and financial services--across entire supply chains. With each company's proven B2B expertise in creating new efficiencies and improved bottom-lines for their members, the two companies together represent the first fully-integrated, full-service e-commerce solution, where buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics can meet in an open, independent marketplace to find new business partners, negotiate purchases and sales, and complete order fulfillment through automated back-office business processes and system-to-system integration. Because both companies' solutions are "ready-now," with low entry costs, chemicals and plastics buyers and sellers can immediately, and profitably, benefit from procurement, sales, and supply chain efficiencies.

The companies will also continue their commitment to the Chemical Industry Data Exchange (CIDX) and the development of Chem eStandards(TM), the standards for the transfer of XML documents between Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, which enable global collaboration among many partners. Transactional efficiencies and cost optimization results as companies connect to trading partners through the World Chemical Exchange or through the Envera Network.

"We have the solutions, the dedication, the experience, and the expertise to help our Members--and all those who will become our Members--to increase their sales and procurement efficiencies, from the start of the online negotiating processes to final product delivery," said Bob Mooney, Envera CEO and newly appointed member of ChemConnect's Board of Directors. "This is now the only virtual one-stop solution for all buyers and sellers of chemicals and plastics in companies of all sizes, around the world."

We are getting ready for the launch of "NetcoOnline" and have been preparing new documentation, a refreshed site design and cleaned products to reflect our Gas and Power focus.
The following timetable could change, but the general sequence should apply in any case:
Week of Jan 14:
Upon approval by the new buyer of the PA and ETA formats, we will contact the Master Users at our Top 50 customers and send them copies of the final PA and ETA forms with our new buyer's name filled in. During this week, we will be working hard to get as many of the PA's returned as possible. Once we have an approved PA, we can send the customer their new User ID, which will allow them to start trading on the day we launch "NetCoOnline".
A Splash page will be available within two business days of knowing our new company name, on a web page reached via an automatic redirect from www.enrononline.com. This page will tell customers about the pending launch of "NetCoOnline" and provide links to the PA and Registration screens and also to the User Admin screens, which will allow customer Master Users to start setting up their Sub users.
The Splash page will look something like the following:
A Press Release will be issued which will include the planned launch date of "NetcoOnline"
Week of Jan. 21:
If all goes well, "NetcoOnline" will be launched on Tuesday, January 22, with at least financial products (timing for gas physical and power physical to be determined according to regulatory issues).
We will send out a mass mailing to approx. 3,000 individuals at 450 companies inviting them to sign up for NetcoOnline. Included in the package will be a simple brochure, copies of the PA and ETA, key messages and a list of Frequently Asked Questions.
General Terms and Conditions (GTC's) will be available online and must be accepted online before a company can start to trade a particular commodity.
Trading/Origination Coordination
Certain individuals in the Trading and Origination groups will be contacting customers on our Top 50 list to introduce the new company and begin the process of getting signed PA's. The NetcoOnline marketing team will work with Trading and Origination groups to make sure that all Master Users that previously had EnronOnline North American Gas and Power execution rights are contacted within one week of the PA and ETA being approved by the new buyer.  NetcoOnline Marketing will follow up with the Master Users to make sure PA's are signed and returned.
NetcoOnline Marketing Contacts:
For Marketing-specific questions, please use the following contacts. For other questions, please contact Bob Shults (30397) or Dave Forster (31861).

The following procedures have been developed by Walt, Mike and myself for the
Environmental matters associated with the Texas New Mexico Pipeline System.
Please pay special attention to Item No. 5 which is not only a change in
procedure but also a huge cost savings to EOTT.
We had a good visit last Thursday with the carrier.  The local representative
and our New York claim representative were present.  We were told repeatedly
that filing timely information and claim notification was required.  We
tempered their nice but stern stance with their own internal issues regarding
the change in our local representative.  All was friendly.  The bullet point
review of the meeting's discussions is as follows and there are several
procedural points that we will adopt going forward:
Expense reporting on the known and unknown sites will be filed  monthly and
the invoices will be provided also at that time.  ( providing the invoices
with the report is a change in the procedure).  I believe that I will be able
to pull the report information off of EMS Works going forward.  Please let me
know who in the organization will be responsible for getting the invoices
together so I can coordinate this process with them.
Invoices from our vendors need to be more descriptive.  Rich was in the
meeting when this was discussed and I have asked him to take this matter up
with our vendors.  In the field, if you see that the description is weak, (
for instance, "per work order") it would be helpful for you to contact the
vendor then as opposed to sending it through the payment process.  If it is
not descriptive enough to identify the work performed, payment will be
delayed and claims processing will be slowed.  This enhancement would also
seem to help us internally identify the expense.
When we are notified of a claim, be it land owner notification of an old
site, or a new spill, a spill/claim report should be filed. I believe that
this is the information that I will be receiving from EMS Works.  If it is an
issue that requires special handling, I will be happy to take this
information directly and outside the normal channels.  One area that will
need to be addressed is an estimate of claim size with each report...and an
update of that information as the claim matures if it changes materially.  I
am not clear if this information will be available in EMS Works or not.  Can
someone get back to me on this process?
As reports or correspondence from agencies/any third party are received, we
will need to forward these on to the carrier for each claim that has been
filed. Also, I will need to forward to the carrier any reports or
correspondence that we submit to agencies and third parties. The carrier does
not want to have to come to our offices to review files if it can be avoided
and would prefer to process these claims as they mature.  As you forward
these items to me for processing, please be sure that they are clearly
identifiable as to the site/claim number.
Any new claim ( that would mean any unknown) will be noticed to the carrier.
Before dispatching anyone from Entrix ( unless this is an emergency
situation),  we will notice the carrier and they will authorize the
investigation by Entrix or any other environmental consultant.  The carrier
has the right to choose who they use, however Entrix is one of  their
approved vendors.  I understand that Entrix charges us a fee for these
investigations and this is a covered expense under the policy.  This will
also aid in the processing of the claim as the carrier will accept their
requested Entrix report as their own investigative report. These charges will
be paid by the carrier, but they need to have the claim verified and then we
need to have them dispatch Entrix to the site.  I also suspect that the fee
that we have been charged by Entrix for these matters is in excess of the fee
that the carrier pays.  Therefore it is even more critical that we have the
carrier engage Entrix and pay them.  There are as I understand 38 task orders
( estimated to be $10,000/each) currently outstanding with Entrix.  I have a
copy of these and I would like to process these through the carrier where we
have not already incurred any expense.  Who can visit with me on the actual
status of any work performance under these orders?  We will need to calculate
work performed and get immediate authorization from the carrier to have
Entrix provide the service going forward for each site.
Lawsuits and paper work will be noticed to me by Legal.
As far as the action items on current updated claims:
Roger Pennifill, the technical claim handler for AIG, was in our offices
Thursday and Friday and with the assistance of Mike Kelly reviewed the files
and talked with the field personnel as needed.
The situation with Jimmie Cooper lawsuit is the top priority with the
carrier.  Cynthia Green will get back to me within a day or so to give me
feedback on the requests that we have made to authorize the fingerprinting of
the crude oil in the Cooper's well.  This matter takes precedence over the
filing an answer on the lawsuit.   Walt Zimmerman will work with Cynthia
Green on the selection of counsel for this matter.  Unless the carrier tells
us otherwise Paul Bohannon will continue to act as lead counsel for this
matter.  Walt will provide Cynthia Green with resumes for Paul Bohannon and
the local counsel that has been suggested.
The second highest priority is Jay Anthony.  We have given Cynthia and Roger
a complete write up on this situation and they will be coming back to us to
discuss the options that we have laid in front of them.
All other claims that we discussed, will be handled as their official
notification of a claim or an update as to the magnitude of the potential
problem.
In the area of site investigation (Example Clay Osborne), we will formally
ask that Entrix be approved to do the necessary  investigative work.

ENW VENTURES PORTFOLIO NEWS

Acta's New B2B Data Server Now Available for Multiple Operating Platforms;
ActaWorks 4.4 Significantly Expands Support for Industry-Leading Data
Integration Solutions

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 12, 2000--Acta Technology, Inc., the leader
in business-to-business (B2B) data integration, announced today the general
availability of ActaWorks 4.4, the latest version of its award winning
enterprise data server. ActaWorks 4.4 provides recent product and performance
enhancements that previously were available only for Windows NT (under
ActaWorks 4.3). Acta made the announcement at the eBusiness Conference and
Expo in New York City.
The new product significantly expands support for the industry-leading
provider of B2B data integration. With ActaWorks 4.4, businesses with Windows
NT, Windows 2000, and Unix environments (HP-UX, Sun Solaris, and IBM AIX) can
all employ Acta's new enhancements for packaging and delivering the data
essential for B2B eCommerce and business intelligence.
Among the new features is a repository architecture that enables centralized
metadata management and multi-user development. As businesses implement a
data platform to support both internal and external access to enterprise
data, the need to manage metadata from external and internal sources becomes
critical -- and the need for multiple users increases.
The addition of these new enhancements further solidifies Acta's leadership
position in B2B data integration, a rapidly emerging component of B2B
integration. Industry analysts have sized the data integration market at $15B
(cumulative) by 2005 -- a market that is being driven by the growing need to
provide information-rich data both inside and outside the extended
enterprise.

Trade-Ranger integrates multiple buying programs

HOUSTON, Dec. 13 -- Trade-Ranger, an Internet marketplace for the procurement
of supplies by the energy industry, has integrated another type of software
into its site to eliminate barriers to its customers and to help build
liquidity.
Allen May, interim co-CEO, told LocalBusiness.com the site has added another
buying tool, iPlanet BuyerXpert software, at the request of one of its
founding partners. Trade-Ranger already had Oracle Corp.'s iProcurement and
Commerce One's e-procurement programs.
"Our members are transacting, we have integrated multiple buying tools to the
Commerce One platform, and we are continuing our effort to build the most
efficient content hub in the industry," May said.
"We will adopt the best-of-breed technology," he said.
Houston-based Trade-Ranger was incorporated in August. Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL)
is based in Redwood City, Calif., while Commerce One (Nasdaq: CMRC) is based
in Pleasanton, Calif. Meanwhile, iPlanet is a product of iPlanet E-Commerce
Solutions, a Sun-Netscape Alliance. Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) is based
in Palo Alto, Calif.
Trade-Ranger is building its membership, and no numbers were immediately
available, May said.
Technology can be a barrier to liquidity growth, May said. Some marketplaces
simply tell customers they must adopt that marketplace's technology, he said.
"We definitely have an open policy," May said.
He added that Trade-Ranger has made a significant investment in technology,
although he was unwilling to disclose the amount spent.
Formerly the Energy and Petrochemical Exchange, the Houston-based exchange
announced its formation on April 11. The exchange describes itself as
"created by the industry for the industry."
Membership is available to all companies, buyers and sellers, in the
upstream, downstream, retail and petrochemical sectors. Upstream refers to
oil and gas producers, while downstream refers to the refining section of the
business.
The original 14 founding partners are Royal Dutch/Shell, BP, TotalFinaElf,
The Dow Chemical Co., Conoco Inc., Motiva Enterprises, Occidental Petroleum,
Equilon Enterprises, Phillips Petroleum, Mitsubishi Corp., Repsol, YPF,
Statoil, Unocal and Tosco.
The collective annual purchasing budgets of the founding partners exceeds
$125 billion worldwide.

GM, Ford take $1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One software company

12/12/2000
The Canadian Press
Copyright (c) 2000 The Canadian Press. All rights reserved.
DETROIT (AP) _ Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. will take a combined
$1.26-billion US stake in Commerce One, making the business-to-business
software company a technology partner in the automakers' Covisint online
exchange.
Pleasanton, Calif.-based Commerce One said it will issue to GM and Ford 14.4
million shares apiece, with each stake valued at about $631.8 million, based
on Commerce One's close Tuesday of $43.88 on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The
combined number of shares represents a 14 per cent interest in Commerce One.
Half the shares for each company will be held in escrow until 2002, and will
be released to Ford and GM upon satisfaction of certain conditions. If
conditions are not met, the shares will be released to the two automakers in
mid-2004.
Commerce One said it will undergo a corporate restructuring into a holding
company and get a two per cent equity interest in Covisint, the Internet
exchange started by Ford, GM and three other automakers. Covisint
incorporated for business Monday.
Commerce One's stake in Covisint will be held in escrow until the completion
of the restructuring, on which Commerce One shareholders are to vote next
year.
Commerce One will be entitled to a share of the revenue generated by the
Covisint exchange for an expected 10-year term, as well as be paid for
consulting services it provides to Covisint.
``We look forward to continuing our efforts with Covisint to deliver a global
e-marketplace platform for the automotive industry,'' Mark Hoffman, Commerce
One's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. ``Covisint is an
excellent example of Commerce One's business model and reflects our
commitment to moving the world's business commerce onto the Web.''
In addition to Ford and GM, Covisint's backers include DaimlerChrysler AG,
Nissan and Renault, as well as Commerce One and fellow software firm Oracle.
Covisint is supposed to act as an Internet marketplace for the auto industry,
allowing suppliers and automakers to swap information and conduct business
far more quickly and cheaply than they have in the past.
Detroit's automakers have said Covisint should be able to route their
purchases of $250 billion a year in goods and services.
Covisint said it has more than 250 customers on two continents already using
its services, including catalogues, auctions, quote management and
collaborative design.

original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : 
The following report is comprised of what was discussed at the Commission meeting held tonight at approximately 7 PM EST and additional intelligence gathered from FERC staffers after the meeting by Joe Hartsoe:
Physical Withholding -- To prevent physical withholding, the plan will require sellers with PGA's to offer all their available power in real time.  All California generators, even those not subject to FERC price regulation, will be required to sell into the ISO's real time market as a condition of their use of the ISO's interstate transmission lines. Hydroelectric facilities will be exempted. (24-7 for 1yr)
Price Mitigation -  The plan will establish a single market clearing price auction for the real time market.  During Stage 1, 2 and 3 emergencies in the ISO's real time market, each generator (other than hydro) with a participating generator agreement is required to offer all available power and bid its marginal cost based on the generator's heat curve, emission rates, gas costs and emission costs, plus $2 for O&M.  The gas cost will be the average daily cost of gas for all delivery points in California; emissions are to be based on Cammon Fitzgerald(?).  The gas cost and emissions will be published the day after, for use on the following day.  A single market clearing price is determined in real time for all generators.  Highest bid sets the clearing price.  Each gas fired generator must file with FERC and the ISO, on a confidential basis, heat and emission rates for each generating unit.  The ISO will use these rates to calculate a marginal cost for each generator, including maintenance and operating costs.  In the event a generator submits a bid higher than the proxy price, the generator must, within 7 days of the end of each month, file a report with FERC and the ISO justifying its price.  FERC has 60 days to review/act.  No opportunity costs in real time.  Marketers are in the same boat, as they must be prepared to justify bid at purchased cost based on specific purchases or portfolio with no opportunity cost.  However, credit sleeves are permissible.
Demand Response - Beginning June 1, only public utility load serving entities must submit demand side bids to curtail load and identify the load to be curtailed under those bids.  FERC is attempting to break the demand curve.  (24-7)
Outages -- PGA generators will coordinate planned outages and report forced outages in accordance with the Commission Staff proposal adopted by FERC.
Term - Order expires one year from date of issuance.
RTO Filing - California ISO and two Utilities must make RTO filing by June 1 or Order lapses with no further effect.
ISO Reporting - On September 14, 2001, ISO must file a status report on how things are working and how much generation has been built.  Comments are due in 15 days.  Quarterly reports thereafter.
Revocation of Market Based Rate Authority and Refunds - The market based rate authority of all public utilities is conditioned on 1) no physical withhold of capacity, and 2) no inappropriate bidding behavior.  Inappropriate bidding behavior includes bidding unrelated to known characteristics of the generation unit or without an input cost basis or bidding not based on unit behavior.  An increased bid based on increased demand could apparently be inappropriate.  In addition, "hockey stick" bids are expressly prohibited (i.e.  bidding 95% at marginal cost and 5% at a much higher level).
Limited 206 filing - Applies to sales in the WSCC, outside California.  Refund conditions apply in real time spot markets when contingency within a control area falls below 7%.  Control areas are not required to publish when this condition occurs.  Apparently anything over marginal cost must be justified.  All marketers and non-hydroelectric generators must offer to sell contractually and physically available capacity/energy to a location within WSCC.  FERC is attempting to mirror the rules applied in California.  Comments are due in 10 days on the 206 investigations.  The refund effective date is 60 days from publication of the Order.
Nox Limits in California --  Must sell requirements do not apply if a unit is prohibited from running by law.  However, it appears that incurring fines does not overcome the must sell requirement- just include the fines as part of the price bid.  Also if Nox is limited, may seek to show that generation would have been sold elsewhere or at different times for determining price.
Surcharge to pay past amount due -- Comments are due in 30 days on 1) whether FERC should require the ISO to surcharge parties for payment into an escrow account to pay past costs and 2) the effect this surcharge would have on the PG&E bankruptcy filing.
No mention was made at the meeting as to issue of exports of power from California.  The Order is not finally drafted as of yet, and the status of the foregoing items could change upon issuance of the Final Order.  We will keep you posted.

original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : 
Tetco held a 637 "settlement" conference last Fiday to discuss their latest
proposal dated March 8th.  Their new proposal involved the institution of a
weekly cash-out mechanism along with a daily variance penalty based on
overall system position.

In brief:
PENALTIES
Stage One--on any day where a shipper's imbalance in greater than 7% in any
zone, the "daily imbalance charge" would be 2x the maximum PAL rate for the
entire balance (not just the piece that's over 7%) in each zone.
Stage Two--on any day where either the Market Area or Access Area is out of
balance by greater than 4%, Tetco would have the discretion to issue a Stage
Two notice, establishing a tolerance level (which could be 0, subject to
Tetco's sole discretion) that all shippers would have not less than 12 hours'
notice with which to comply.  Under Tetco's propsal, any volumes in excess of
the level stated in the notice would be assessed a "daily imbalnce charge"
equal to 4x the maximum PAL rate.
In a Stage 2 situation, if your imbalance is in the opposite direction of the
pipe, no penalty would be charged (but you'd still cash-out)

CASH-OUT
Weekly monetization of cash-out positions based on a Sunday to Saturday week
(Tetco needs to revise this so that the weeks are managed depending on how
the calendar falls so that they minimize problems like a 2-day week).
Monetization by Zone in 2 tiers
0-4% to be cashed-out at the average of each day's mid point price for the
weekly period
4%+ ENTIRE IMBALANCE cashed-out at the weekly highest/lowest common price
for the week
This is a significant change since under the current tariff, shippers pay a
staggered fee, such that volumes with in the first tier are charged that
tier's price, then overflow into the next tier is charged at that tier's
price, etc.  Now, the entire amount would be assessed the higher price.

NETTING & TRADING
would be limited to the week in which the imbalance was incurred and would be
limited by zone (contrary to Order 637)
Any netting or trading would not decrease the daily imbalance charge (the
positions would be frozen each day) but could decrease the cash-out exposure
(completely contrary to 637 which indicates that netting & trading should be
a tool used to limit penalties)

Results:
it would be possible, in fact likely, that a shipper would pay both an
imbalance penalty and a cash-out fee on the same volume (contrary to Order
637)
under the Zero tolerance Stage Two scenario, Tetco would have complete
discretion to set the level (not itself a bad thing, they need to be able to
control their system)--they've indicated that they'd set a 2% floor for
penalties but that doesn't really solve the problem.
not only would the cash-out mechanism be more difficult to administer, it
could significantly increase our cash-out liability and subject us to
penalties that do not exist today.

Dynegy, PGC and Indicated Shippers indicated to Tetco that we don't see any
progress towards settlement, or even a foundation to go forward on and that
we're ready at this point to go to the Commission for a decision on their 637
filing as a whole.  Several of the LDC's stated that they want to continue to
pursue settlement so we agreed to submit a status report to Staff indicating
that we'll continue to talk, setting an April 30th deadline.  At that point,
I expected that Tetco would attempt to establish an aggressive negotiation
schedule in an effort to make some progress--instead all they did was agree
to my request to provide a comparison of the different offers and scheduled a
follow up meeting for April 10th.

Tetco indicated that they don't plan to make another offer and would not
agree to entertain counter-offers.  At this point, I doubt that we'll make
any significant progress and believe that this issue will end up being
litigated, or at least submitted to  the FERC for a decision.  Based strictly
on the letter of the Order (or at least our interpretation of it), I think we
have

Please let me know if you have any questions / concerns / comments.

Thanks,
Suzanne

Okay - our exchanges of e-mail were suppose to improve mutual understanding
and it seems to keep getting deeper as I go.
Two issues - 1) putting multiple transmission providers on the same path on
a tag (stacking of parallel providers), and 2) transmissionless interchange
(business practice #11)
Number 1 - don't we in the WSCC want the ability to have tags that can
contain multiple transmission providers on the same path?  For example PSEI,
PGE, and BPAT are all TPs offering Johnday-COB service.  There could be a
transaction that would utilize a reservation with each provider and it would
be most convenient to stack all that information in one tag.
Andy suggests the WSCC might want to come-up with an alternative, such as
one administrator TP for the whole path.  Sounds like an RTO.
So, if we have a choice, we prefer the ability to stack providers on a tag -
yes???
Number 2 - the transmissionless interchange.  I have been suggesting that we
will continue on with our practice just using the TP that belongs to source
(or sink) as stated in BP #11.  Andy doesn't think that'll fly in 1.7.  What
really concerns me is his statement that "Under 1.7, a CA cannot exist
without a parent TP."  Funny, I always looked at it the other way around.  I
don't know what that means to SCL, CHPD, and other CAs who, up till now,
have not registered as TPs.
My example was a MIDC CA to CA transaction that has historically been at the
bus without transmission.  The participants have traditionally used their
interchange accounting systems to record these deals as scheduled
interchange with another CA.  Transmission was not taken into consideration
since the participants had owned and/or contract rights from MIDC to their
systems.  In addition, it has been an easy way to path-it-out by sinking it,
then creating separate transaction source at the same place.
I did feel that this issue shouldn't be brought to IS's attention - that we
would just work it out with our business practices.  What do you think?

Recently, EnronOnline has changed direction in regards to 3rd party access to EnronOnline and our technology.  We want to make sure that we are working closely with each of your desks to ensure that both of our interests are aligned.  Please be informed of two initiatives that we are working on.

Creating private label e-market places for other companies
- We are utilizing the technology that we've created for EnronOnline to create similar platforms for other companies (real time trading to inventory management).
3rd Party price posting on EnronOnline
-Essentially, we are selling licenses that allows 3rd parties to post their products onto EnronOnline.  We are targeting products that complement the current product 	set listed on EnronOnline (i.e. pipeline capacity).

Please pass this along to members of your group.  Any discussions involving our core commodities would require prior desk approval.  We are available to speak with any of your groups in more detail.  If you would like to discuss these initiatives, feel free to contact myself at 713-853-9673 or Brad Richter at 713-853-4893.

The homework assignment of the fourth grade
was to have each child get their parents to tell
them a story with a moral at the end of it.

The next day the kids came back and one by
one began to tell their stories.

Kathy said, "My father's a farmer and we have
a lot of egg-laying hens. One time we were
taking our eggs to market in a basket on the
front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in
the road and all the eggs went flying and broke
and made a mess."

"And what's the moral of the story?"
Asked the teacher.

"Don't put all your eggs in one basket!"

"Very good," said the teacher. "Now, Lucy?"

"Our family are farmers too. But we raise
chickens for the meat market. We had a
dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched
we only got ten live chicks. And the moral
to this story is, don't count your chickens
until they're hatched."

"That was a fine story, Lucy. Johnny, do
you have a story to share?"

"Yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story
about my Aunt Karen. Aunt Karen was a
flight engineer in Desert Storm and her plane
got hit. She had to bail out over enemy
territory and all she had was a bottle of
whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. She
drank the whiskey on the way down so it
wouldn't break and then she landed right in
the middle of 100 enemy troops. She killed
seventy of them with the machine gun until
she ran out of bullets, then she killed twenty
more with the machete till the blade broke
and then she killed the last ten with her
bare hands."

"Good heavens," said the horrified teacher,
"what kind of moral did your daddy tell you
from that horrible story?"

"Don't fuck with Aunt Karen when
she's been drinking."

A major bill for direct access at this time is SBXX 27.  This draft bill has language (Section 3 - part e) that would allow the CA DWR to get a fee from direct access customers who return to utility service to avoid imposing costs on other customers or the state. ESPs would have to pay the fee if they send their customers back to bundled utility service. The fee would be "equivalent to any unvoidable costs imposed on the department's portfolio attributable to the load" of the returning customer.  ESPs would be required to post a bond or demonstrate insurance coverage before they can serve customers. So far, this latter requirement only applies to ESPs who serve small customers, but I could envision this expanding to all ESPs.

set out below is a short summary of today's steering committee call.  i have inserted my notes and recollections from the call in bold text into the agenda we used for the call.  in addition you should receive a call-in # from shelby kelley at bracewell for a TFG call at 11:00 am est tomorrow to further address these issues.  i apologize for the inelegance of my typing, but there have been a few things going on today.




We have taken the liberty of proposing an agenda for the 2:30 Steering Committee call.  We do so not to drive the agenda but to attempt to focus us on issues we need to address and to help us organize these calls to make them more efficient.  Please consider this a starting point for an agenda and circulate any changes you would propose.

I. Process issues
a. Assign clean up of a TFG e-mail list that all should use. 5 min.
vanness will undertake this task and try to develop a "clean " e-mail list. please don't be offended if you get an e-mail seeking to confirm your identity. once developed it will be circulated with a request that all tfg members delete old list and only use this one.
b. Propose development of official restricted service list. Discuss e-mail service
problems 5 min.
dan w will move on Monday for the judge and/or staff to require creation and create a restricted service list based upon signed non-disclosure statements. to facilitate you might remember to include your e-mail address in the disclosure statement signature block.

c. Develop consistent decision procedures for TFG filings/documents.
(opt in/opt out/consensus?)  15 min.
to minimize confusion over getting on or off of tfg filings and pleadings we agreed to propose the following procedure for the group's consideration.  1. group filings will be circulated as far in advance as possible and the e-mail circulating it will clearly describe it as a draft group filing, and identify when comments must be receive and when it is intended to be filed. 2. a filing becomes a group filing if the steering committee recommends by general consensus.  3. group members can expressly opt out or express partial support or disagreement, but must do so with their own filing.

II. Discuss Process for Finalizing the Joint Stipulation of Issues  20 min.
a. Designate small negotiating group
b. Discuss unilateral back-up filing letter
c. Assignments

there was general consensus in the steering committee that a joint stip could be worked out without much difficulty and that position is reflected in the letter from us to the judge conveying the tfg proposal.  a significant number of the members of the steering committee were comfortable going with something very close to the net purchaser's version.  sandy rizzo and pat godley were delegated the task of meeting with chabot and coordinating with peter berger to seek to reach agreement.

III. Discuss Process for Finalizing Ripple Claims Stipulation  20 min.
a. Timing and process for shopping around
b. Back-up position?
c. Assignments

agreement was reached to begin right away to shop the ripple claim stipulation to the other lead counsel.  paul fox will shop it with chabot and staff, gary bachman will shop it with peter berger.  we agreed to get in front of judge as soon as possible, with or without other party support.

IV. Planning Ahead (in this case that's everything after today)
a. Responsive case prep. 10 min.
-  subgroup assignments to flesh out outline
- assignments of witnesses to outline areas
parties are encouraged to get ideas and witness suggestions to don kaplan tomorrow.  response to outline has been underwhelming so far and the clock is ticking loudly.  there will be a lawyers meeting/call at bracewell Friday around 12:30, after the group call to begin organizing for preparing the responsive case. there may be a further witness meeting Tuesday, dan watkiss/don kaplan to coordinate.
b. Rehearing - reports on how parties are proceeding.   5 min.
ron carrol will circulate a detailed outline of a rehearing parties are free to join in. other parties may file their own.  no big tfg effort on this since a number of other issues are raised such as non-jurisdiction etc.
c. Answer to motion to Permit Appeal.  5 min.
agreed to take a pass(good choice since the judge issued an order within a hour or so of the call)  need to discuss who will argue now that judge wants argument.
d. Assign a Discovery battle swat team 5 min.
agreed this was a good idea to have a small group ready to address discovery battles such as motions to compel and/or even more requests to avoid disrupting people focused on case prep.  looking for volunteers!!
e. Assign swat team for motions to strike. 2 min.
agreed this was also a good idea, particularly if the californians come to play.  again looking for leader and volunteers.

V. Clean-up issues
a. Any JDA issues left? What happens to non-signers? 5 min.
consensus that non-signers can not be in group, with consideration given to entities with a formal approval process so long as they commit they want to sign and are seeking the necessary approval.

b. Status of Protective Order  2  min.
judge took care of that
c. Should we seek another pre-hearing conference? for what? 3 min.
judge took care of that too.  actually there was  a discussion that larry acker will bring up with the entire group about pressing the judge on Monday for a more rational process, i will let larry expound here but will state up front that we share his concerns and believe we must raise some of these concerns with the judge.
d. Any interest in seeking relief from the Commission from the crush of the ridiculous schedule? 2 min. see note above and larry's earlier e-mail, attached(Larry, i hope you don't mind)

Finally, we would like to suggest that we agree to schedule a standing Steering Committee meeting by conference call every day at a fixed time either at the beginning of the day or the end of the day and assign a "note taker" that will prepare a summary report back to the whole group by e-mail.  Things are happening too fast to continue working in a reactive mode.  Thank you for your consideration of these thoughts.
agreed to set a fixed schedule of every other day calls starting next week.  if anyone sees something i forgot or did not get quite right please feel free to add to this message, i never was much of a note taker.  gary

GE Global Plans Railroad Exchange Site
The Washington Post

Can online commerce help rail companies save money on locomotives and boxcars?

Gaithersburg-based GE Global eXchange Services will announce today the Global
Rail Exchange, which aims to facilitate just such purchases.
The Internet-based business-to-business exchange, which has been in testing
for three months with some of the largest buyers and sellers of railroad
equipment, officially opens for business today with the goal of serving as
the online marketplace for trade of all the goods used by railroads.

By bringing diffuse manufacturers and buyers together into one exchange, the
company hopes to offer an attractive proposition to each side, said Otto
Kumbar, the vice president of interchange solutions at GE Global eXchange
Services.

Suppliers have joined to get access to more potential buyers, while buyers
have joined to pit suppliers against one another in pursuit of the lowest
possible price for components of railroad systems.

Global Rail Exchange, despite starting well after the crest of the wave in
business-to-business start-ups, claims several advantages. It is run by a
wholly owned division of General Electric Co., giving it clout in the
marketplace, and already has 700 companies as users, including some of the
biggest names in the railroad industry such as Amtrak, Norfolk Southern Corp.
and CSX Corp.

The company aims to bring liquidity to the market for rail industry supplies,
and to cut transaction costs by conducting them online and profit through
subscription fees, as well as collecting a transaction fee for each completed
sale.

Kumbar claims that in the initial tests with customers, suppliers saved an
average of 10 to 25 percent on costs normally associated with selling their
goods.
Many online exchanges have had trouble gaining a foothold this year, as
innumerable start-ups have set up--often in the same market--and many have
yet to complete their first transaction or are struggling to generate profits.
"I think the key to our exchange is making sure you have a return on
investment for all buyers and suppliers," Kumbar said. "We have that."

John, Bill this is the latest on the environmental issues for the turbines in
Arizona.  The arch surveys at stations 3 and 4 on the Navajo reservation have
been completed and nothing reportable was found or identified.  Each
contractor is now preparing their reports and hopefully, will have them
submitted to their mgt. for review in a couple of days and then issued to
TW.

The Forest Service has given us permission to do the arch survey for station
2 on Monday.  The arch survey for station 1 is scheduled for Tuesday.
Preliminary quotes for the surveys are $4-5000.00 for both sites.  The
original word from them was 7-10 prior to giving approval.   This was
definatley a plus.

Still no word on where the turbine buildings are to be located and what
turbine equipment is to be installed at each facility.  GE or Rolls Royce.
Additionally, confirmed decisions have not been made as to what auxillary
power will be installed at each location (wind, natural gas, diesel).

I would appreciate receiving a list of access groups and their members for the O:\Research directory and subfolders.  If there were a way to list what kind of access each group has for each folder (or at least which groups have Modify access), it would be great.  I have already spoken with Sandra Hart who has begun the process.

Thank you for your assistance in our effort to maintain the integrity and security of our data.

Regards,
Martin Lin

We have unsuccessfully attempted to find sponsors for the project list you gave to me in our meeting.  I would therefore like to start the game again but starting from zero and working our way up. Assuming we are starting with no budget for IT development, please could you sit down with each of our Business Sponsors and agree a number with them.  They are:

Tim Belden (or his appointed person) for West Power
Lloyd Will for East Power
Geof Storey for Gas
Laura Luce for Peoples and Global Net
Chris Gaskill for Gas Fundys
Rob Milnthorp (or his appointed person) for Canada.
Mark Haedicke/Greenberg (or his appointed person) for Legal.

Each of the above will be allocated their charge for IT development and capital (apart from Geof who will allocate across the desks) and therefore is the best person/people to decide on the costs.  Please could you arrange a short meeting/discussion with each and agree a budget as the process so far is not working.

I am assuming its zero at the moment.


Thanks

Louise

Walt:

Attached is a copy of the TX label that has been prepared for small customers.  For suppliers purchasing off of spot, the actual numbers to calculate the label and emissions will not be out until January.  However if a company is making an "environmental claim" (I'll deliver you 100% wind), the company projects the fuel/emission mix they will deliver to the customer over a year period.  See attached Green Mountain label as an example. <https://www.greenmountain.com/gmec/tx/tx_efl.jsp>

As we discussed if TI is looking to differentiate their fuel mix, I know that Elliot and Richard will be able to help you from the REC commodity end.  They will not be able to offset their NOx limits under the SIP by purchasing renewables.  They will have to purchase ERCs or allowances from other companies that have overcontrolled or install control technology.  I took a look at their Environmental statement, and they have an internal pledge to reduce energy consumption by 15% for their facilities.  They highlight the emissions reductions from the conservation and detail their fuel mix (page 15).  <http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/citizen/esh/english.pdf>
I'd let TI know that we can provide their fuel mix and emissions as well as offsetting their system purchase with RECs.

The TX labeling rules are as follows:

1. Disclosure labels with fuel mix, emissions data and average price are required to be submitted to residential and small commercial customers.  Labels are submitted to customers 2 times per year and an annual report substantiating the purchases and sales is required to be submitted to the PUC.
2. To calculate the label or label(s), the supplier weights the percentage of power coming from system contracts/bilaterals/spot and renewable energy credits.  The PUC has provided the fuel and emissions data from each generating company in TX along with the emissions on their website.  <http://www.puc.state.tx.us/rules/rulemake/22816/050301lableworkbook.xls> They will provide the default system mix for spot purchases by year's end.
3. Each supplier will have a percentage obligation to purchase renewable energy credits (representing the "attributes" of 1 MWh of renewable energy dispatched onto the grid) and will note this on the label.  EES cannot "market" their obligation as a renewable product so you can't sell a product for a premium representing your entire renewable mandate to customers.

I'm glad to answer any further questions.

Enron lived 'on edge - sex, money, all of it'
The rise and fall of Houston decadence
Philip Delves Broughton
The Daily Telegraph, with files from news services
HOUSTON - Enron was a company in love with itself. Office affairs were rampant, divorce among senior executives an epidemic and stories of couples steaming up glass-walled offices after late-night meetings were the talk of Houston.
"It was insane," says a former energy trader, soothing her financial injuries with a margarita.
"There were no rules for people, even in our personal lives. Everything was about the company and everything was supposed to be on the edge -- sex, money, all of it."
The music has suddenly stopped. The startling demise of the energy giant has wiped out savings and pensions, destroyed careers and dragged the U.S. version of free-market capitalism into the interrogation room.
The reverberations of Enron's collapse will be felt for years in Washington and on Wall Street, but nowhere more than in Houston, the stage for Enron's gaudy act. From the mid-1980s, when Enron was created by the merger of two energy companies, Houston became its town. The company filled the void left by the oil companies, whose buccaneering days had ended with the collapse in oil prices.
In River Oaks, the most exclusive suburb of Houston, Enron executives began building huge mansions. Jeff Skilling, the executive who transformed Enron under the more genteel rule of Ken Lay, the former chief executive, decorated his house in black and white, Enron's corporate colours, from the marble to the sofas to the flowers, wallpaper and pictures.
The Enron wives became known around town for their Mercedes, fur-trimmed sweaters and leather pants.
But in the excitement, Enron lost touch with its mortality, not to mention morality. Mr. Skilling wanted it to become an alternative to the Wall Street banks.
He wanted to recruit the best, which meant persuading the leading business school graduates from places such as Harvard, his alma mater, and Stanford to choose Houston over New York or Silicon Valley.
He did so by creating the same culture of unselfconscious greed and reward that Wall Street was forced to suppress by the insider-trading scandals of the late 1980s. He built his own Bonfire of the Vanities in Houston and everyone wanted to feel its warmth.
Among the perks were the in-house health club and doctor's office, as well as laundry and car-washing services. Broadband traders were issued hand-held computers and wireless laptops, and frequently went on junkets to the Bahamas or hunting weekends in Mexico. Others accompanied Mr. Skilling to hike glaciers in Patagonia or race Land Cruisers in Australia.
One employee described how he got a 10% discount in a tony men's clothing store by mentioning he worked for Enron. Elsewhere in town, nightclubs waived cover charges for Enron employees.
But the work culture that employed these carrots was brutal.
Managers employed a system known as "rank or yank," with semi-annual reviews in which every employee's performance was ranked one to five. As the names flashed on a projector, the bosses graded them. The bottom 15% of workers were fired each year.
The pay was not particularly high -- trainees started at US$35,000, The Wall Street Journal reported. But they could double that when bonuses were added. Bonus day was known as Car Day, because of the line of expensive sports cars that arrived for the most successful employees -- US$100,000 Porsches were the vehicle of choice.
To the outside world, Enron described itself as a family for which employees were delighted to work punishing hours. Inside it became increasingly incestuous, sexually and financially.
Only those at the top and the traders who saw the kinds of wild bets Enron was placing, on everything from oil to the weather, saw how precarious the whole thing was. They began pulling out as much money as they could.
The best brains began demanding vast salaries to stay and, to save face, Mr. Skilling paid them. Then they asked for more. Senior executives began selling their shares in huge blocks. Everyone at the top was cashing out, while those further down believed the hype.
"We all thrived on the buzz," said Mark Lindquist, 39, a Web designer who lost his US$75,000-a-year job and is struggling to pay for his autistic son's treatment. "It seemed like we were part of something incredible."
He was one of the 4,500 let go after the company fell into bankruptcy on Dec. 2.
Now, not only the rank-and-file are hurting. Yesterday, Mrs. Lay said her family also lost its fortune.
In an interview with NBC's Today show taped over the weekend at her home in Houston, Linda Lay defended her husband as a decent, moral person who, like many thousands of others linked to Enron, was fighting personal bankruptcy.
"Other than the home we live in, everything else is for sale," she said. "We are fighting for liquidity."

Settle This
Which technology resolves disputes best?
March 20, 2001 issue

Michael Grebb

St. Louis retiree David Hubert couldn't have been happier to score a replica
of a $3,000 Charles Eames leather chair on eBay -for only $450. When it
arrived, he tore open the box, pulled away the bubble wrap, and immediately
sunk into the chair to ease his bad back. "As soon as I sat in it, I could
tell...whoa, this isn't right," he says. "It had a bad mildew smell-I mean, a
really bad mildew smell." Distraught, Hubert emailed the seller to demand
that he either pay to clean the chair or take it back. The seller refused.
"He basically stonewalled me," Hubert says. So Hubert filed a grievance with
SquareTrade, a San Francisco-based startup that helps resolve disputes on
eBay.

A SquareTrade online mediator-a real person who corresponds with both parties
via email-immediately began negotiations. After a week of back-and-forth, the
seller finally agreed to send Hubert $150 to have the chair cleaned. Hubert
and the seller never were in contact. "I think it went really smoothly,"
Hubert says.

Mediation has been a popular alternative to lawsuits to resolve disputes,
especially those involving small amounts of money. For businesses, conflicts
between state and international laws have made dispute resolution costly, no
matter how big the transaction.

With $657 billion changing hands through Internet transactions worldwide, it
comes as little surprise that a raft of new dot-coms plans to move the
mediation process further online. Everyone expects online mediation to grow
as the number of transactions conducted online continues to grow. "Regardless
of the market fluctuations and a fair amount of blood on the street,
ecommerce is here to stay and is growing at a steady pace," says Steven
Abernethy, president and CEO of SquareTrade. "There is wealth of commerce
online to keep us and others busy for a while."

The American Arbitration Association estimates that dispute resolution is a
$200 million-a-year industry, but there's no way to know how much of that
would migrate online. "I'm not sure it would necessarily shift," says
association spokesperson Toni Griffin. "Online transactions may simply
generate more disputes, which would grow the whole market." American
Arbitration-the largest dispute resolution company with 140,000 cases per
year as of 1999 and $65 million in annual revenue-recently announced its own
online mediation business.

Online mediators agree that easier dispute resolution will drive faster
adoption of ecommerce by businesses and consumers, many of whom may now avoid
online transactions for fear of getting hosed. According to Forrester
Research, two-thirds of businesses say they would not conduct an online
transaction with a party they don't already know.

What they can't agree on is how to use technology to resolve disputes. Some
companies, such as SquareTrade, eResolution, or Online Resolution, have had
experience resolving disputes. They are mediating disputes online simply by
substituting an online chat session or email for the conference table or
telephone. But a few upstarts say these companies aren't harnessing new
technologies that allow mediation to be automated.

"This is not as simple as slapping up a Website," sniffs Charles Brofman,
president and CEO of Mount Kisco, N.Y.-based Cybersettle.com. He doesn't
mediate disputes but offers an automated blind bid system to negotiate
settlements when liability has already been established. Here's how it works:
The aggrieved party enters a demand; the liable party enters the most it will
pay (Neither side sees the other's entry, hence the term blind bid.) If the
numbers are within 30 percent of each other, the software automatically
splits it down the middle and settles the claim. For each dispute, the
parties get three tries, after which they must start over if their entries
still haven't come within 30 percent. The company says the site can handle as
many as 10,000 simultaneous sessions per second.

Brofman says he has signed insurance companies to flat-rate subscription
plans in which Cybersettle offers discounts for a certain number of claims
per year. "This system just takes all of the ego and personality and whittles
it down to what it should have been-settling the claim," he says. That's
especially important, he says, for international disputes in which cultural
differences can muddy an otherwise objective claims process.

Rival clickNsettle.com offers a service similar to Cybersettle's, but doesn't
limit parties to three bids per cycle. Instead, it uses a monetary
disincentive to stop parties from gaming the process. ClickNsettle doesn't
set a bid limit, but charges a small fee for every settlement offer made. CEO
Roy Israel says the fees are just annoying enough to keep parties from
wasting bids on outlandish demands. "It eliminates the ridiculous," he says.
"It keeps someone from asking for millions of dollars. It causes people to
get real-real quick. No one wants to waste $100 on bids that don't go
anywhere."

Israel criticizes Cybersettle's three-bid process, calling it inflexible
because it "artificially terminates" the process even when parties haven't
settled. And as you might expect, Brofman is equally skeptical of
clickNsettle's unlimited bid system. "If you go to infinity, people just try
to game the system," he says. "And once insurance companies realize you can
game the system, they're not going to use it."

His clickNsettle.com was called National Arbitration and Mediation for eight
years before adopting a dot-com moniker last year. "We're not just an
Internet startup trying to capitalize on dot-com hysteria," Israel says.
"We're a mediation business evolving into a Web-enabled business." In fact,
its existing mediation infrastructure allows the company to give users the
option of moving disputes offline if necessary.

The question is whether either Cybersettle or clickNsettle-or any of the
other mediation sites-will catch on. "I'm skeptical of these automated
mechanisms," says Forrester analyst Charles Rutstein. "It's a little too
'Let's-let-the-machines-do-it.'" He wonders whether all the messaging
back-and-forth makes sense for many disputes that could be easily settled
using traditional means. "Just pick up the friggin' phone," he says.

At today's FERC meeting, the Commission voted out a draft order in GridSouth's RTO proceeding.  The original March 14, 2001 order accepted the GridSouth "Order No. 2000 compliance filing" subject to modifications and requiring meetings with Santee Cooper to achieve their participation in the RTO.  Today's order denies rehearing and grants clarification.  Following is a brief summary of the pertinent points of the order.

The order requires that all terms, rates and conditions must be on file with the FERC.  The original order recognized GridSouth as the sole provider of transmission service on its grid, requiring all uses under the GridSouth tariff.   The RTO applicants requested  clarification that the FERC was not requiring unbundling of retail rates.  They had intended to place their bundled retail load under the GridSouth Tariff for terms and conditions, but not rates.  The rehearing order does not assert jurisdiction over bundled retail rates, however GridSouth is now the sole provider of transmission service and the applicants must take all transmission services, including transmission underlying bundled retail service from GridSouth.  Therefore, the order requires all terms, conditions and rates to be on file at FERC.
All specific rate issues will be deferred until GridSouth files a Section 205 filing.  This allows a possibility that GridSouth could file different rates for native load and FERC jurisdictional transmission services.  It is not clear what the FERC will do with this issue.
GridSouth will initially operate three control areas.  A request by Joint Protesters to integrate resources and loads anywhere on the system and allow netting of imbalances over all CAs was denied because Order No. 2000 did not require a single control area.  However to allow one-stop shopping, the Commission is requiring a single agreement which can contain information for each delivery zone.  (Compliance is required in 10 days.)
Though the Commission did not require netting over all control areas now, the order did suggest that GridSouth should give consideration, in consultation with parties, of mechanisms to minimize energy imbalances on an RTO-wide basis through either operational or trading mechanisms.
Defers issues relating to ancillary services and Hourly Imbalance charge until supplemental filing.
Denies rehearing request of Santee Cooper asking the FERC to find that unlimited passive ownership compromises the independence of an RTO and should not be allowed.  The order finds that a case-by-case review is appropriate where the RTO Applicants have an opportunity to show the passive ownership proposal is designed to protect the financial interests of the passive owners but does not allow TO control of the RTO decision making process.
Allows right of first refusal of existing GridSouth members to purchase new equity interests issued by the Board until the Initial Public Offering, in order to protect existing members against dilution of the value of their membership interests in case the Board were to issue new equity at too low a price.
The Commission does reiterate that its goal is the formation of a single RTO in the Southeast.  Scope and configuration will be addressed in a separate order in review of the May 14 filing.
Denies EPMI's request for a settlement judge proceeding.
Denies EPMI's request for rehearing on conditioning market-based rate authority on RTO participation.
Denies EPMI's requested clarification that GridSouth cannot incur significant start-up costs before the independent Board is seated.  The order notes that GridSouth represents it will not incur significant costs for software or hardware for real-time balancing until approved by an independent Board.

On behalf of Enron Corp. we look forward to partnering with EES in 2001 and
helping EES reach their 2001 goals.

Thank you.

As you know, Enron,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way.
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize the
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kickoff of the
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  As of
August 3rd less than 25% of our executives have turned in their pledge.
Enron,s United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporate
match). ENA,s share of this goal is $346,500.  While these are aggressive
goals, they are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we
can easily surpass these goals.

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I,d like to have 100%
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the
level.

I am a proud member of the Alexis de Tocqueville Society, which is a
contributor of $10,000 or more and have pledged significantly more this year
than last year.  Enron has 39 members of this Society, only 5 of which are
from ENA.  I would like to see this number increase significantly and if you
are able, I would like you to consider stepping up to this level.  Given the
fact that Enron executives are highly compensated with generous options and
bonus program, I encourage each of you to at least become a member of the
"Make a Difference" Club, which is a contribution of 1.2% of your annual
salary.  I would also challenge each of you to increase your pledge this
year, regardless of your level of giving last year.

With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I,ll need the
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across
the ENA organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENA.  Your
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENA by giving generously and
getting your pledges in by August 9th.

Team,

We need to push forward on the next phase of the pricing model.  I sense that
we have lost some momentum so we need to pick it back up.

Enron needs to shed some of the risk of this deal in order to be able to do
more of them.  I think the insurance market is a great platform to accomplish
this.  I think our success potential is high as long as Enron is in a first
loss position and pro-rata loss for the balance.  However, I am not confident
that the insurance industry will be able to work up a meaningful offer.  My
solution is to calculate a bid for their services.

The loss I am trying to protect is associated with a bankruptcy process where
Enron seeks to gain control of the underlying asset and/or its liquidation.
I propose that the trigger for an insurance pay-out would be the sale of the
underlying project to a third party in a liquidation scenario for the benefit
of creditors (i.e. EPMI).

I would like to price a structure where EPMI takes the first $50/kw of Loss
and 10% of the balance.  Loss will be defined as Par amount of debt
outstanding plus Net Amounts owed EPMI less sale proceeds from plant.  Net
Amounts owed EPMI will include the net amount of MTM and accrued index
payments owed EPMI under both the Financial Buy and Financial Sell contracts
as of the date of sale.  For purposes of this analysis lets assume initially
that Net Amounts are $0.

One way to price this product would be as a put option of 90% (100% - 10%) of
the MW of the plant at a price equal to par amount of debt less $50/kw.  I am
open to other ideas.

I expect results to be presented in the form of reduction of the put premium
( equity's option to put plant to EPMI) that we have been calculating to date.

It is also essential that we update the pricing models to reflect different
start and end dates and different strike price calls for each year.

regards,

Don

////////////////////////////////////////
original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : original text : 
The following are my comments on the draft interconnection agreement.

In the sixth "whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 3.4 and 5.1.6) the contract
states that either the generating company or the generating company's
customers are responsible for entering into a separate service for
transmission service.  In any given transaction this may be incorrect and
therefore must be changed.  Specifically, a third person may in fact be
responsible for taking the transmission service and the generator may have no
ability (or privity of contract) to require this entity to take transmission
service from Sierra Pacific.  For example, the generator may sell the power
to Dynegy, who may sell it to Sierra Pacific who might then be buying the
transmission service.

The eighth "Whereas" (page 1) (and Sections 2.18, 3.1, 31.7, E.4.1, E.4.2,
E.8.2, E.8.3, E.8.4, E.8.6, E.8.7, E.11.10, E.11.11, and E.12.) state the
generating company is willing to maintain the generating facilities in
accordance with good utility practice and enter into a WSCC Reliability
Management System (RMS) Agreement.  I would like to point out that some
generators do not like to commit to the "good utility" practice standard or
to be bound by the RMS agreement.  Enron has signed the RMS Agreement.  I
doubt Sierra will be willing to sign this if we oppose the good utility
practice standard.  This is especially true because BPA is insisting on this
standard in the context of negotiating RTO West and, in order for RTO West to
form, BPA must agree to join.  Enron is very interested in RTO West forming.
If you want to oppose the Good Utility Practice standard, we had better
develop a good rationale for being opposed to it and a justifiable
alternative standard.

Section 1.1  Contrary to our requests, this section still states that the
agreement will become effective on the date which FERC permits it to become
effective.   This is not the way the OATT operates.  Rather, if Enron and
Sierra cannot develop a consensual interconnection agreement, Enron asks
Sierra to file an unexecuted interconnection agreement with FERC (as we have
done) and service begins pursuant to the terms and conditions of Sierra's
open access tariff.  Service here is governed by the transmission open access
tariff because FERC has determined that interconnection is the receipt point
portion of transmission service and that if a public utility does not have a
separate tariff governing the procedure for requesting the interconnection
portion of transmission service than the procedure established in the OATT
applies.  The FERC has determined that filings under Section 212 (and
therefor 211) of the Federal Power Act are no longer necessary because the
customer simply requests service under the OATT.  Requiring the customer to
wait until the FERC decides the agreement should become effective would
completely  undermine the purpose of Order No. 888.

Section 1.2 After, "by both parties" add "however, if the parties cannot
agree to execute this agreement, System Owner shall file this agreement
unexecuted with FERC as provided by the terms of the OATT."

Section 1.6.2   Three years advance written notice is too long.  A reasonable
notice period would be ____.

Section 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8 EPMI opposes the definitions of "Applicable Laws"
"Applicable Permits" and "Applicable Reliability Criteria" because, when
combined with their use throughout the contract (in Sections 2.6, 3.5, 3.10,
3.11, 5.6.2, 5.6.3, 8.4.2, 11.8, E.2.8, E.3.3, E.4.1, E.4.3, E.4.4, and
E.9.5) they subject EPMI to legal and regulatory risk by consenting to
amendment of the contract by government action.

Section 2.19 Section (i) of the definition of "Dispatch gives Sierra too much
control over the generating unit by allowing it to redispatch for "the most
reliable" supply.  Change "the most reliable" to "a reliable"

Section 2.31 Is inconsistent with Sierra's OATT.  It should be written using
the same words as the OATT.

Section 2.52  The reference to Section 22.1 should be corrected to 21.1.

Section 2.56 Definition of "System Integrity" is too broad.  When combined
with Section 3.13.2, it would require our generator to not "have an adverse
impact on "maximiz[ing] the health, welfare, safety of personnel and the
general public."  While Sierra can voluntarily do so with its own facilities,
there is no reliability or governmental requirement that we do so and we
should not.

Section 3.5 The proposed Use of "System Integrity" here is more fair assuming
EPMI agrees to the "Good Utility Practice" standard.

Section 3.7 Shouldn't the word "unplanned" be added before the word Outages?

Section 3.8 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it would be
directly assigned the cost of facilities that are being used by others.

Section 3.10 The second sentence exposes EPMI  to regulatory risk by allowing
Sierra to add new facilities and charge them to EPMI.    This risk is
increased by the last sentence which allows Sierra to determine the need for
such facilities in its sole discretion.  Editorial note: the third to last
sentence is missing a period.

Section 3.13.2 See comments under Section 2.56.

Section 4.1 EPMI opposes the first sentence because it gives Sierra an
opportunity to have FERC order additional payments for the same level of
service already provided by this contract.  Accordingly, the words "or
ordered by FERC" should be deleted.

EPMI opposes the second sentence because it would allow Sierra, with FERC's
approval, to allocate to EPMI costs incurred for Sierra property and for
operation of Sierra's facilities

Section 4.3 Should the words "generating company's applicable FERC-approved
tariff" be changed to "Applicable Law?"

Section 5.1.1 EPMI opposes the last sentence because it would presumably
require EPMI to pay more than cost for any project whose scope does not
increase by more than 10 percent.  Under FERC's precedent, EPMI is only
required to pay actual cost.

Section 5.1.3 Nine months seems like to long a time to wait to provide a
final invoice.

The words "plus Interest" should be added after the words "difference" in the
fourth sentence.

Section 5.6.2 This section says essentially the same thing as Section 3.10
and EPMI opposes it for the same reasons.

Section 6.4.3 Add period at end of sentence.

Section 7.1 Delete period after the word "and" in last sentence.

Section 8.1.4 Add period after "Interconnection Facilities."

Section 8.4.2 EPMI opposes paying for all modifications to interconnection
facilities to the extent that such modifications benefit Sierra or third
parties.

Section 8.7.2 Delete the word "and" on the seventh line.

Section 9.1.1 See comments under Sections 2.56.

Section 11.7 Delete "pen-nits" from last line on page and insert "permits."

Section 11.8  After "remediation or abatement activity" insert "pay all
fines, penalties, or compensations as required by law."

Section 13.4 There should be a reciprocal provision for generators.

Section 16.2 EPMI opposes "regulatory" Force Majeure.

Section 16.6 This provision is too broad in that it allows the System
Operator to evaluate the alternatives available to the EPMI.

Section 17.9 Add the letter "y" after "and ma" on the second line.

Section 19.2.1 Third to last line change "ahs" to "has."

Section 19.3 Needs to be edited.

Section 19.6 This section subjects EPMI to the regulatory risk of amendment
to the interconnection agreement to conform to an RTO's requirements.

Section 22.5 By law, System Operator should be required to file with FERC
prior to terminating the connection.

Section 31.8  This section exposes EPMI to regulatory risk because it allows
Sierra to unilaterally file with FERC to change the terms and conditions of
the interconnection contract.  This is standard in utility tariffs and
agreements and in fact is in the FERC's pro forma OATT under Order No. 888.

Section 31.9 of the contract retains EPMI's rights to protest any unilateral
filing by Sierra under Section 31.8 and seems to balance the rights given to
Sierra in Section 31.8 by allowing EPMI to file a complaint challenging any
of the rates, terms, or conditions, etc., of the interconnection agreement.

Exhibit D D.1.1 EPMI should not be required to provide free station service
to the extent it benefits Sierra Pacific or third parties.  A higher level of
service should not simply be at the election of the System Owner but rather
at the agreement of the Parties.

D.1.2 The phrase "Except under Applicable Law," should be added before the
first sentence.

D.2 EPMI opposes providing free VArs and opposing providing VArs at a level
determined by Sierra's discretion.  Accordingly, EPMI opposes this entire
provision.  If Sierra wishes to purchase VArs, EPMI would agree to provide
______ level of VArs at ____ rate.  EPMI would also agree to provide VArs at
Sierra's discretion, subject to this rate, in the case of an Emergency.
Otherwise, EPMI would be foregoing the opportunity to provide real power
(instead of VArs) to the market at a market-based rate, and it might be
subject to having such transactions cut at Sierra's "discretion" without
being assured the cost of cover.  Accordingly, the rate standard of cost or
foregone revenues would not be compensatory.

D.3 EPMI opposes this provision to the extent that it could be read to
require EPMI to provide free Black Start Service.

D.4 Since the generator is not taking the delivery portion of transmission
service, it is not required to buy or self provide any ancillary service
including regulation and frequency response service of real-time load
-following service.  Accordingly, this provision should be deleted.

D.5 EPMI opposes the second sentence of this paragraph and it should be
deleted.  Sierra should get ancillary services from the market.

E.2 Change "minimized" to "minimize."

E.2.4 Oppose requirement to notify Sierra of defects in generator "may affect
System Integrity."

E.4.1.3 EPMI opposes giving the Control Area Operator authority to "approve"
Planned Outage Schedules.

E.4.4 Once again EPMI would oppose the use of the term "System Integrity"
here as too high as standard.

E.6.5 The second sentence gives the Control Area Operator too broad authority
to preclude Planned Outages.

E.7.1 Add the word "the" on line 4 after "at."

E.8.1 EPMI opposes requiring the Generator to receive prior Control Area
Operator authorization to undertake any action that is "reasonably likely to
have an adverse impact of System Integrity," especially adjustment of the
amount of real and reactive power it delivers to the Transmission system
under E.8.1.1.

E.8.2.2 Because VArs could be sold as real power, System Control should not
be allowed to "establish the range of voltages or voltage schedules."
Rather, Sierra Pacific should negotiate with EPMI to buy the level of voltage
support it requires.  See also E.8.9 establishing power factors.

E.8.4 EPMI does not have a problem with operating its AGC within WSCC limits
but it will not be providing this Ancillary Service free to Sierra.  We need
to negotiate compensation.

E.8.6 Giving Sierra "sole discretion" to determine "unacceptable
deterioration of the quality of service over its Transmission System" is too
broad.

E.9.2 "Repots" should be "reports"

Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is
because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management.
They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The
new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him
next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New
Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in
a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in
Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and
regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is
placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the
partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the

Greetings "Cruise Group,"

Below is the information from the travel agent concerning our June
cruise.  The agent's names is Virginia Book (281-293-3666).  She is
copied on this email if you need to email her as well.

It looks like, depending on what room you wanted, the price is $50 -
200/person more than what Robyn originally told you.  Robyn feels bad,
but I told her that's "chump change" to all you Rockefellers.  However,
if you want to downgrade your room (to "peasant" class with all the
Browns) to compensate for that increase, please contact Virginia
directly.

You need to contact Virginia concerning your deposit and specific
identification name by Sunday, Feb 10 which really means Friday, Feb. 8.
Don't forget or delay.  We'd hate to lose some of you.  We've got a good
group together.  Because of our group size, we're going to get some
discounts (See below).  Anything we get as a lump-sum discount, Robyn
and I will ensure it gets spread across the entire group.

Scooter/Kenny - Please provide this information to the friends you've
invited.  Also, I'm not sure my email address for Rusty is good, so make
sure he knows.

Virginia - There is a group of us interested in playing golf at one of
the disports.  Can you find out for me the possibilities of getting
tee-times (3) for about 10 folks to play?  It looks like the most likely
spots are Grand Cayman or Mexico.  Obviously, I don't have a feel for
course availability or timing requirements.  I would look to you to tell
me where my best spot is to get off the boat, play a round of golf on an
adequate course, and get back on the boat before I get left.  Please let
me know what my golfing options are.  Thanks.

names are due on February 10.  Final payment is due by April 5. I will
need credit card(preferred) for payment or if paying by check need to
have checks here at least 7 days prior to payment dates.  There will be
a 50.00 per cabin discount at final payment.  Also, if all cabins booked
sail, there will be a tour conductor deduction of 1060.00 be divided

that does their insurance, for you after deposit and names are
confirmed.  Berkley Care only takes checks.

You all will need a valid passport or Certified or original birth
certificate with raised seal and government I.D. ( like driver's
license).  Sometimes the ladies need their marriage certificate to show
the maiden name matching on birth certificate.  I will check on that for
you all.

He cancellation penalties are as follows:

From 59-30 days 250.00 per person
From 29-8 days 50 percent of total price
7 days or less - no refund.

This is so exciting and you all have a fine ship for your sailing
experience.
You are confirmed for second seating for meals but that can be changed
if you like.

Many thanks, Virginia

MARKET NOTIFICATION OF SYSTEM CHANGE

PIP Number(s):        144, 200



PRR Number(s):       294



Protocol Section(s):   4.4.4, 6.3.1, 11.4.1.1



Implementation Date:     January 18, 2002



Description of System Change:

ERCOT plans to implement PIP 144/PRR 294 (Load Ratio Shares per LSE) and
PIP 200 (LSE Load Ratio and Loss Allocation) on January 18, 2002.   The
Protocol revision for PIP 144 impacts sections 4.4.4 and 6.3.1 of the
Protocols.  The revision for PIP 200 is documented in section 11.4.1.1
of the protocols.

Currently, ERCOT calculates ancillary service obligations for each QSE
for a given trade day based on the QSEs aggregated Load Ratio Share as
of the same day of the prior week.  This results in the use of QSE/LSE
relationships from one week prior to calculate ancillary service
obligations.  When an LSE switches from one QSE to another, the
obligation associated with its load continue to be allocated to the old
QSE for one week after the effective date of the switch.  The same
obligation does not get allocated to the new QSE for the first week
after the switch.  QSEs also do not have access to Load Ratio Share data
per LSE that makes up their ancillary service obligations.

This modification will alter the way the QSE Load Ratio Shares are
aggregated so that ancillary service obligations are calculated based on
the QSE/LSE relationships that will be effective on the trade day for
which obligations are being posted.  Load Ratio Shares will be
calculated and saved by LSE during the data aggregation process run for
initial settlement of the trade day in question.  QSE Load Ratio Share
will then be aggregated and posted for a given trade day based on the
sum of LSE Load Ratio Shares calculated as described above corresponding
to the most current QSE/LSE relationships for that trade day.

Scheduled Extract Changes:  Billing determinants for LSE Load Ratio
Shares called LRSLSE will be added to the load extract.  Each QSE will
have the LRSLSE fields added to its load extract for each LSE it
represents.  Each LSE will also have the LRSLSE field added to its load
extract with its Load Ratio Share information.

Dynamic Extract:  The Settlement and Billing folder within the archive
extracts area of the portal will have an additional dynamic extract
folder added called Obligations?.  This dynamic extract folder will
have two extracts called QSE obligations? and LSE obligations? which
can be used to query Load Ratio Shares by QSE and LSE.  The following
ERCOT total quantities will also be added to the dynamic extracts above:

Total obligated non-spinning quantity (NSOTOT)

Total obligated regulation down quantity (RDOTOT)

Total obligated responsive reserve quantity (RROTOT)

Total obligated regulation up quantity (RUOTOT)

representative.

The following information was provided by Cyndi Wulfson with the Outlook Migration Team.
Email Diskspace Usage Policy states that each user will be provided a Microsoft Exchange mailbox for use with Microsoft Outlook and that mailbox will be limited to a maximum storage limit of 100MB. It is important to note that the Global Messaging team had these mailbox capacity limits in Notes, however, they weren't strictly enforced. As we move to a new mail system, it is critical that all users of Email understand their responsibilities of proper Email usage, mail capacity policy enforcement and the resulting paradigm shift of how Enron utilizes eMail.
Enron has a legal retention policy that states that backup tapes of Email are kept a maximum of 8 days, items in folders older than 365 days are deleted/purged, and therefore eMail should be thought of as temporary storage. It is absolutely critical that as an Email user, we use Email as only the reception point and initiation point of mail and not as storage.
Ways of properly storing mail and mail contents are:
1.	Detach attachments to the home directory (H:\). This will decrease the overall size of one's mail file significantly. A user must be very diligent about this routine of receiving and detaching attachments to h:\.
2.	Deleting unneccessary Email from mailbox folders and mailbox system folders such as the Sent Mail folder. One would be surprised at how many times one attachment or large message is floating around in their mailbox as conversation threads.
3.	Review and follow the recommendations for conserving diskspace and customizing your Outlook mailbox for more efficient identification and viewing of mail sizes and conversation threads.
4.	Additional diskspace can be requested through the eRequest system: <http://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp>  This requires approval from the user's Vice-President or above and comes in 25 MB increments. Each 25 MB increment requires a separate eRequest and approval.
5.	Public Folders can be requested through the eRequest system: <http://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp>  Public Folders can be an additional place for shared group information, group calendars, or personal mail storage. The name Public Folders is misleading - they are essentially folders that reside on an Exchange server that can be viewed and used through Outlook. They can be given rights to a single user or many users. Public Folders still have the legal retention policy applied to them if they are used for mail storage, personal or shared.

As a reminder to all market participants, a REP does not have to wait until
the recission period expires before it sends the switch request in to ERCOT.
In many scenarios, a customer may wish for a REP to expedite handling of
their request and the REP is willing to balance the risk of  customer
cancellation against a customer's desire to receive service in a hurry.
Although this is not the same "customer protection" period identified below,
it may help expedite some service requests.  Further the PUC would like to
remind market participants of the their obligations as highlighted in the
rule below.  The commission is receiving too many calls from customers who
have not been provided accurate information from their REP and/or from REPs
who merely blame another party for the delays.

Specifically, Substantive rule 25.474(i) states the following:

(i) Submission of customer's selection to the registration agent. A
REP may submit a customer's selection of the REP to the registration agent
prior to the expiration of the cancellation period prescribed by subsection
(h) of this section. Additionally, the REP shall submit the switch request
to the registration agent at the proper time so that the switch will be
processed on the date agreed to by the customer and as allowed by the tariff
of the transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or
electric cooperative. The customer shall be informed of the scheduled date
that the customer will begin receiving electric service from the REP, and of
any delays in meeting that date. Additionally, the REP must advise the
registration agent of any "special needs" customers and renew such
notification to the registration agent annually.

Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.
As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.
Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

I have recently spoke with most of you about increasing our emphasis on structured product deal flow. Over the past 12 months, East Power mid-marketers have been focused on covering every customer across the eastern interconnect. Our deal flow through June 30, 2001 stands at 201 term transactions vs. 25 at the same time last year. That's an increase of 8 times. This represents outstanding performance.  Many of those transactions have been relatively standard energy block and option structures. The proliferation of EOL   among our customers has had the effect of shrinking standard product margins. Therefore, we need to increase emphasis on customized risk management products in order to optimize value extraction from our customer base.

We must identify 5 potential "break-out" customers within each of NEPOOL, NYISO, PJM, FRCC, SERC, SPP, MAPP, MAIN and ECAR. That's 45 total target customers for those counting. A break-out customer is a customer with which Enron executes substantial increased transaction flow (especially structured products) with significant associated origination value. I need both coverage and structured product mid-marketers to work as a team to do detailed profiles of the business of each of these customers. A non-exhaustive list of issues to analyze are:

- What is the customers fundamental business(es)
- Supply/demand fundamentals
- Tariff implications
- State regulatory implications
- Identify their risks
- RTO affiliation
- Open access issues

Profiles should be complete by Friday August 10. I will review completed profiles with each of you.  We will develop custom risk management presentations for each of these customers for role out after the profiles are complete. I will be working with Harry Arora to develop presentation materials. Let me know if you have any questions.


Thanks,   Ed

Report: Power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion
DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
Thursday, March 22, 2001
,2001 Associated Press
(03-22) 11:41 PST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Electricity wholesalers have
overcharged California more than $5 billion since May by manipulating the
energy market, according to a report prepared for power grid managers.
The Independent System Operator will file the findings with federal
regulators and ask for a refund, ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said.
The state auditor also said Thursday that the state's 1996 deregulation law
encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to ``manipulate wholesale
prices to their advantage'' by underestimating supply and demand.
The auditor's report lays out what it calls ``a complex combination'' of
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.
According to the ISO report, five in-state power suppliers and 16 importers
frequently offered electricity at prices higher than it cost them to produce
-- effectively withholding supplies -- or didn't bid at all when they were
able to generate power.
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at a
conference in Berkeley last week.
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were
justified.
The commission has recently stepped up scrutiny of power companies' behavior
during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124 million in
sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money. Critics
claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged.
California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since
January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by
electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless.
Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring
wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from
recovering the costs from customers.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's
power-buying is gutting its budget surplus.
Since the state started making emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen
from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said.
Connell ordered an audit of the power buys, saying Gov. Gray Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund''
she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10
billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to
demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the administration has released the
financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term
power contracts with wholesalers.
Also Wednesday, a federal judge ordered a major wholesaler, Reliant Energy
Services, to continue selling power to California despite its fear that it
will not be paid.
The ISO buys power from companies like Reliant on behalf of utilities in
attempts to fend off rolling blackouts like those that hit the state this
week and during two days in January.

Reliant To Appeal Fed Judge Ruling To Sell Pwr To Calif

03/22/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) said Thursday it will
immediately file with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in
response to a federal judge's ruling late Wednesday that the company continue
selling power to California regardless of whether it is paid.
U.S. District Court Judge Frank Damrell granted California's Independent
System Operator, which makes last minute power purchases in the spot market,
a preliminary injunction against Reliant, saying Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the state.
The ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, said the judge's ruling
will allow the agency to keep the lights on in California.
Reliant, which is owed more than $300 million from the state's cash-strapped
utilities, supplies California with about 3,000 megawatts of electricity from
power plants it owns in the state.
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said the state Department of Water
Resources, the agency that buys California's bulk power needs on behalf of
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit
Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas &
Electric, should back the ISO's last minute power purchases.
In a filing with the Securities and Commission, Reliant said it is owed $108
million by the DWR for last minute power purchases the ISO made during the
six weeks prior to the agreement Reliant made with the DWR.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's claim, saying he does not have the authority to
force the DWR to pay for that power.
"We're going to immediately appeal Judge Damrell's order," Wheatley said.
"Clearly the judge understands the implications of his order. We are required
to do business with creditworthy entities. Unfortuantely the judge did not
force the ISO to post a surety bond, which would allowed us to do business
with the ISO."
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state is not responsible for the last minute
power purchases the ISO makes, despite a law passed authorizing the DWR to
buy power on behalf of the utilities.
Wheatley added that the company will also seek relief on the issue at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Damrell's ruling remains in effect
until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
Separately, Wheatley said a short-term power supply contract that Reliant
signed with the DWR expired Monday and the DWR has not renewed the contract.
A spokesman for the DWR would not comment on the issue.

Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California

Updated: March 21, 2001 - 8:23 p.m.
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major
electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear
that it will not get paid.
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO
buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try
to fend off blackouts.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.
The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by
suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the
costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said.
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three
other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling
to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.
Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office
Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press
seeking comment on the ruling.
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring
the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order,
requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue
sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling.
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out,
enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for
roughly 750 homes.
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant
said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most
of the power is committed under long-term contracts.
Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it
won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison.
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June
due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996
deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers.
At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part
to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight
hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest.
Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state
Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed
the state to avoid blackouts.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also
imperils California's financial health.
Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is
gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power
buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2
billion, she said.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its
power-buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.
"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand
that kind of audit information," Harrison said.
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the
$10 billion in long-term debt.
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity
purchases.
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money."
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering
challenging Davis next year.
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with
wholesalers.
Also Wednesday, a report by Davis' chief power negotiator appears to show
that as much as 75 percent of the state's power purchases will have to be on
the expensive short-term market this summer, said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina
del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee.
"The prices may be phenomenol," she said, particularly given predicted
hydroelectric shortages due to drought in the Pacific Northwest.
The report by David Freeman, who is negotiating the state's long-term power
contracts, shows California has finalized 19 contracts and has 25 agreements
in principle. Freeman said DWR is continuing to negotiate other contracts.
Bowen said FERC should impose short-term price caps or let generators to
charge enough to make a reasonable profit "or we could be subject to enormous
price-gouging this summer."

State falling short on pacts that provide low-cost energy
Published Thursday, March 22, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News
BY CHRIS O'BRIEN AND JOHN WOOLFOLK

Mercury News

The state has signed low-cost contracts for just a third of the energy it
needs this year, raising the prospect that California could be forced to buy
much of its electricity this summer on the expensive spot market.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis conceded Wednesday that the state will be in
trouble without more contracts, but insisted California will meet its needs
through conservation and additional long-term deals for cheap electricity.
The state, according to a report released Wednesday, has fallen far short of
the governor's goal of filling almost all its electricity needs through such
deals. In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount
Davis had projected earlier this month.
If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price
of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price,
pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay.
But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said
he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the
plan.''
In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water
Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million
megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million
megawatt-hours needed.
``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in
three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a
lot more to do.''
The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the
state's nearly bankrupt utilities.
The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power
at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68
per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in
December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low
as the $55 Davis hoped to reach.
Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to
2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under
contract. Until then, the amount falls short.
In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The
gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003.
At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would
have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the
open market.
At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a
rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David
Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available
electricity has already been sold.
``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford
professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator,
the agency that runs the state power grid.
Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this
summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've
resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power.

Crisis saps state surplus
POWER CRISIS
Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion
surplus has been cut more than half since January
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER
The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more
than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a
top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases
and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account.
A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5
billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion,
according to Controller Kathleen Connell.
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus," Connell said in a
statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration
officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. "The energy
crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the
electricity purchases would put the fund at risk."
Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the
governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing
long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys.
According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from
the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be
forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly
expensive spot market and further drain its coffers.
And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that
would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides
what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state
treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay
taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric
utilities.
The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the
utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week
contributed to blackouts.
Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of
money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state
officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that
will be repaid by electricity consumers.
The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on
since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from
the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a
day.
High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy,
and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell.
In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the
transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration
to send her office more information about the electricity purchases.
Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the
funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused
her of making political hay.
"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want
to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like
this," said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. "We're sorry
it came up in this manner."
Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The
controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her
Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of
the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power
generators and traders to sell at higher prices.
Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority
either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state
water resources department.
Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid
is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the
blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if
the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers.
Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants,
wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to
spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and
Tuesday.
Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as
qualifying facilities, "immoral." The QFs were either unable to buy gas from
their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them.
"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any
money out," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "They've got the money --
we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it."
The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough
cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion.
Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to
heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of
ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys.
PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water
resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected
from ratepayers for power purchases.
The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among
QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric
plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the
spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson.
"There isn't enough to do that," he said.
That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked,
according to a growing chorus of officials and experts.
Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack
of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others
will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said.
"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money
is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?" Nelson
said. "What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state."
Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the
utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets,
Maviglio said.
"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going
there," he said.
WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM
About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three
major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third
comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques
and one-third is bought on the open market.
The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after
the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the
purchases themselves.
But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has
planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases.
Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15
but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven
suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.

Bill to pay small energy firms stalls
By Kevin Yamamura, Dale Kasler and Jim Sanders
Bee Staff Writers
(Published March 23, 2001)
A quickly melded proposal that would assure payments for alternative energy
suppliers whose money woes contributed to power blackouts this week stalled
Thursday in a divided Legislature.
The state Senate passed the bill, AB 8x, but with Republicans balking, it was
rejected in the Assembly along party lines. Assembly leaders said they may
try again today.
For most of Thursday, lawmakers scrutinized legislation they had overhauled
the night before to include Gov. Gray Davis' plan to force utilities to pay
solar, wind and small gas-fired suppliers. Such providers, called "qualified
facilities," or QFs, provide more than 20 percent of California's
electricity, and their shutdowns were partly to blame for rolling blackouts
Monday and Tuesday.
Under the Democratic governor's plan, the state Public Utilities Commission
would determine prices at which alternative generators may sell power, but
legislation is needed to authorize the PUC action.
Lawmakers faced time pressures Thursday. They wanted to pass the bill quickly
so the PUC could act next week and legislators could embark Monday on an
annual three-day lobbying trip in Washington, D.C.
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said the Republicans'
rejection of AB 8x could jeopardize more than $4 billion the state has spent
or allocated for electricity during the energy crisis.
Hertzberg said producers of alternative energy, which are owed more than $1
billion, have threatened to drag debt-ridden utilities into involuntary
bankruptcy if the Legislature failed to pass the measure.
"They said it, and I believe it," Hertzberg said. If such bankruptcies occur,
he added, the state with its multibillion-dollar debt would become "just
another creditor in a pile of creditors."
But Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park said the
finger-pointing is unfair. Passage of AB 8x would not necessarily prevent
bankruptcies, he said.
One alternative energy provider won a crucial court ruling Thursday that
staved off, at least for a while, threats by some creditors to haul one or
both big utilities into bankruptcy court for nonpayment of bills.
CalEnergy Co. Inc. won the right to sell its geothermal power, which was
contracted to Southern California Edison, on the open market. CalEnergy said
it is owed $45 million by Edison.
If the Imperial County judge hadn't ruled in CalEnergy's favor, the company
and seven other QFs "were fully prepared" to file an involuntary bankruptcy
petition against Edison this morning, said David Sokol, chief executive of
CalEnergy's parent, MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. of Des Moines, Iowa.
"That is currently off the table."
An involuntary bankruptcy proceeding would take California's energy crisis
into uncharted territory, although a bankruptcy judge would have the leeway
to reject the filing.
Freed from its contract with Edison, CalEnergy will move to sell its
electricity "to people who will pay for it," Sokol said.
Besides calming the bankruptcy movement temporarily, the ruling also could
prompt other alternative energy providers -- hundreds of which have shut down
because of nonpayment by Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to follow
CalEnergy's example and find other buyers for their electricity, said Gary
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators.
Assembly Republicans said they felt the Senate's decision to package three
important energy issues into a single bill was an attempt to ramrod
legislation through both houses.
"We have to stand and say no," Campbell said during floor debate.
Besides determining alternative generator payments, the bill would change an
earlier law by capping the value of bonds the state may sell for power
purchases at $10 billion. It also would extend to large businesses an
existing rate cap in the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. service area.
And it would earmark a portion of rates paid by utility customers to fund the
state's ongoing power purchases. Within a week, the state will have spent
$4.2 billion on power since January.
Without the bill, some legislators fear, Pacific Gas and Electric and
Southern California Edison would be reimbursed before the state.
"They have got (some) gall to go to the PUC and say they're going to go to
court to keep our money -- to keep our money to pay off their creditors,"
said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.
Most of the bill's controversy, however, centered on how the PUC would treat
gas-fired alternative generators.
The commission issued a revised draft decision Wednesday that would impose
prices for qualifying facilities at $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year
contracts or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years.
But those producers that use natural gas -- representing about two-thirds of
the alternative energy providers in California -- spent Thursday arguing that
Davis' plan to rescue them would all but guarantee that they would go out of
business instead.
The plan -- ordering Edison and PG&E to pay them a fixed price for their
power -- would set rates well below the cost of natural gas, they said.
Democratic lawmakers tried to assure such producers that the PUC would set
prices that make business sense, even obtaining a letter to that effect from
Loretta Lynch, who heads the commission.
Davis has vowed to fine Edison and PG&E if they don't pay alternative
producers for future deliveries. But Sokol said his company isn't convinced
that Edison will pay.
Calling Edison a "confrontive, in-your-face, nasty organization," Sokol said
the utility was "sitting on $2 billion" and not paying its bills. Edison, in
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday, said its debts outweigh
its cash reserves by $722 million.
The Senate sent the Assembly two other bills that deal specifically with
supply and demand. The first, SB 5x, would spend about $1 billion on energy
conservation and low-income assistance programs. The other, SB 28x, would
streamline siting procedures for power plant construction.
In separate energy-related matters Thursday, the Assembly approved:
AB 21x, which would allow businesses, industries or other electrical
customers to negotiate private contracts with energy providers.
Nine energy bills designed to generate or save 665 megawatts of electricity
-- including 345 megawatts this summer. One megawatt is enough electricity to
light about 1,000 homes.
The state put power emergencies behind it, after dropping out of a Stage 1
alert late Wednesday. The California Independent System Operator, which
manages the state's power transmission grid, was predicting no further alerts
this week. It expected cooling temperatures and a regular dropoff in
electricity use on Fridays to lessen demand, at the same time that more power
plants were returning to service.

House panel ends energy hearings -- will it step in?
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published March 23, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- A key House panel wrapped up a series of hearings on the
California electricity crisis Thursday and now will decide whether to come to
the state's aid with legislation.
But the panel's Texas chairman made clear that West Coast price controls
won't be on the table.
"Caps will not be in anything I am submitting," said Rep. Joe Barton,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality
subcommittee.
Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this
summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of
witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings
over five days.
Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and
Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like
New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging.
But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for
enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused
to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by
opposing any legislation that would compel such action.
Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative
remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation.
He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and
after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and
Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order.
"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer,
we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks," Barton said.
Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a
"careful and deliberate approach" to the California crisis, which he said was
largely of the state's own making.
There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as
more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality
standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate
through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by
about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes.
But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power
production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality.
"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to
air emission limitations," he said. "California's programs to protect public
health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to
date."
The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale
prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California
and the West Coast.
William L. Massey, the lone member of the energy regulatory commission who
supports price controls, said at a Tuesday hearing that without them the West
Coast faces economic catastrophe this summer.
It was evident from the comments of some Republicans that they think their
party could capitalize politically from a difficult summer.
"If they had a bad summer, it could show up in the polls," said Rep. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga. "And sometimes that's not a bad idea."
One of the most dramatic exchanges during the weeklong hearings came Thursday
with S. David Freeman, the former general manager of the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District who now heads the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
He recently was named Gov. Gray Davis' chief negotiator with power generators
for long-term contracts to stabilize future deliveries.
"Don't feel sorry for California," Freeman said. "We're going to come out of
this stronger than ever."
But Freeman said it will be a year or two before all the fixes are in place,
and in the meantime the region desperately needs Congress' help to force the
FERC into controlling wholesale prices, which witnesses said are likely to
rise from $7 billion last year to as much as $70 billion or more this year.
"We recognize that the current administration and various legislators have
their own opinion as to the California situation," Freeman said. "But my
personal plea is that if the federal government is not going to help us, the
least it should do is refrain from legislation that attempts to tell us what
to do."
Barton perked up at that idea.
"Leave California alone, huh?" Barton said. "That might be a good motto."

Dan Walters: Crisis deepens: politicos panic


(Published March 23, 2001)
That choking sound you hear is California's political class shifting into
near-panic mode as it realizes that the energy crisis is on the verge of
becoming a full-scale meltdown, with utilities forced into bankruptcy and
consumers hammered by severe and prolonged power blackouts and soaring
electricity bills.
The Legislature, which had been content to allow Gov. Gray Davis to handle
the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's
unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities
into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation
aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting
conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and
electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and
other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a
political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes.
While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility
deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming
Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and
even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the
governor.
"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and
a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient,"
Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private
negotiations and public posturing.
A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a
warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had
already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she
refused to authorize additional transfers. It was a direct shot by Connell at
Davis, an old rival, and came just a day after the governor had endorsed a
Connell foe, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the duel for mayor of Los Angeles.
Other Democrats didn't join Connell's direct challenge to Davis, but there
is, nevertheless, a growing concern among Democratic legislators that the
power purchases are costing many billions of dollars more than the governor
had projected and could place the state budget in jeopardy. They're nervous
because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much
power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying.
From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is
spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's
reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis
probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate
increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently
into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order
huge refunds from power suppliers.
Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the
costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared. Data from the
administration and utilities, when collated, indicate that the state is in
line to collect just 20 cents for every dollar it's spending on power
purchases, and the gap will increase as summer heat drives up demand.
Privately, some economists say that private utility rates will have to rise
33 percent to 50 percent to cover costs of current power supplies, plus
utilities' past debts to generators and the state's purchase of the
utilities' transmission system, if that deal is made final.
"It's ultimately going to break down, and the ratepayer is going to pay for
it one way or the other," Republican Sen. Jim Battin said during one of
Thursday's many committee hearings on utility legislation. No one disagreed
with him.

Report says power wholesalers overcharged state $6 billion



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Electricity wholesalers have overcharged California more than
$6.2 billion by manipulating the energy market, according to a report by an
economist working for power grid managers.
The Independent System Operator planned to file the findings with federal
regulators Thursday, and ask for a refund, said ISO spokesman Patrick
Dorinson.
In a related development, the state auditor said Thursday that the state's
1996 deregulation law encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to
"manipulate wholesale prices to their advantage" by underestimating both
supply and demand.

California's electricity crisis at-a-glance




The auditor's report lays out what it calls "a complex combination" of
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.
The ISO's filing came a day after the state controller complained that a
relentless energy crisis is jeopardizing California's financial future.
Since May, the companies manipulated the market by bidding at excessive
prices, effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they
had generation capability available, according to the ISO study.
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at an
energy conference at the University of California, Berkeley, last week.
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were
justified.
In a burst of activity after weeks of delay, both houses of the Legislature
approved bills Thursday designed to ease the energy crisis.
The state Senate approved measures to encourage energy conservation and speed
up power plant construction.
Topping that, the Assembly sent the Senate 14 energy-related bills, including
$455 million in loans and grants to encourage energy efficiency and
conservation and alternative energy projects by this summer.
One of the Assembly bills would require new energy plants approved by the
state to sell their power within California before they offer it to other
states.
"The (California) Energy Commission says for every day we delay this bill
there are 20 megawatts that could be saved that we're not saving," said state
Sen. Byron Sher, D-Stanford, as senators voted 28-10 to send his conservation
measure to the Assembly.
Senators also approved another Sher bill speeding up the siting of power
plants. It went to the Assembly on a 37-1 vote.
Meanwhile, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering
one of the companies named in the ISO filing, Reliant Energy Services, to
continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid.
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys at
the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend
off blackouts.
Such blackouts struck the state twice this week, shutting off power to
hundreds of thousands of people from San Diego to Oregon, snarling traffic
and shutting down businesses.
The state remained free of any power alerts Thursday morning, as power
reserves stayed above 7 percent.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities,
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.
The utilities have been denied credit after amassing billions of dollars in
debt paying high prices for power that the state's energy deregulation law
prevents them from passing on to consumers.
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the
costly last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said.
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
In another development Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell
complained that the energy crunch is imperiling California's financial
health.
Connell said the state's power buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is gutting
its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power buys in
January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she
said.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power buying, saying Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She is also refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its power
buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Connell is a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles in next month's election.
The ISO study, meanwhile, covered five major in-state power suppliers )
Reliant, Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, as well as 16 power
importers. All deliver power to customers of Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., the state's three largest investor-owned utilities.
"All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts," said
ISO's Sheffrin.
According to the report, the overcharging took place beginning last May, when
the energy crisis began, and continued through last month.
During that time, according to the report, energy suppliers commonly offered
their electricity at twice the amount it cost them to produce.
FERC member William L. Massey said he wasn't shocked to hear the amount
overcharged added up to more than $5 billion.
"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said.
Chuck Griffin, spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant said the company would
justify their charges to FERC officials.
"I think we're missing sometimes just how basic the problem is in California.
Supply and demand are out of whack and some basic rules of economics kick in
when that happens," he said.

Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm



Controller puts hold on transfer of $5.6 billion to reserve funds
By Karen Kucher and Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS
March 22, 2001
The state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5
billion since January largely because California's power purchases are
devouring the money, state controller Kathleen Connell said yesterday.
Connell said she wants to see more documentation about state power spending
before approving the transfer of $5.6 billion from the general fund to a
special reserve fund requested by Gov. Gray Davis.
Connell said the state would have to borrow $2.4 billion to cover the
transfer.

"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has
taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity
purchases would put the (general) fund at risk," Connell said in a statement.
Her action came on a day when state power supplies improved. After two days
of forced outages this week, no rolling blackouts were ordered yesterday.
Several power plants came back on line and imports from the Pacific Northwest
provided enough electricity to meet demand yesterday, said Stephanie
McCorkle, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator,
which manages most of the state's power grid.
"Gradually more (electricity) generation comes on every day," McCorkle said.
"By Monday, we should see somewhere around 2,200 megawatts back in service
that was not on this Monday. That's if no other generation falls off."
Meanwhile, Connell's move took some by surprise.
A spokesman for the state Department of Finance said Connell is denying a
routine transfer that is required by law. "It was just a routine accounting
measure that we didn't anticipate becoming controversial," Sandy Harrison
said.
Connell announced the denial of the transfer a day after Davis endorsed one
of her opponents, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, in the race
for Los Angeles mayor.
Connell, who monitors California's cash flow, said she was "deeply concerned
about putting the state's general fund in a deficit situation in light of the
energy crisis."
About two months ago, the state began spending about $50 million a day to buy
power after Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison nearly
went bankrupt. It is also purchasing power for customers of San Diego Gas and
Electric.
The Davis administration said earlier this week it soon will begin spending
an additional $500 million on power purchases, bringing the total to $4.2
billion.
As that staggering sum continues to grow, the state won a court battle with
an electricity supplier yesterday. A federal judge in Sacramento sided with
the state and ordered the wholesaler to continue selling to California
despite its fear that it will not get paid.
Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm
if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the Independent System
Operator. The ISO acquires last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill
gaps in supply to try to fend off blackouts.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for the power.
Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly
last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing
state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
Meanwhile, those who manage the power grid say the forecast for power
supplies this week looks good, although conditions can change quickly.
ISO managers continue to stress the importance of conservation. Utility
customers across the state conserved about 900 megawatts of power Tuesday,
which kept blackouts from being ordered that night.
As the power crisis worsened this week, ISO managers wished aloud that they
still could rely on business customers to shut down in exchange for lower
energy rates.
Such "interruptible" customers saved as much as 2,100 megawatts last spring,
a figure that dropped to about 1,700 last summer and 1,400 at the end of the
year. But in January, the state Public Utilities Commission told utilities
they could no longer impose fines on business customers who refuse to shut
down when asked.
ISO managers realize the program was harming businesses with frequent
interruptions of service -- but they still miss having that option, McCorkle
said.
"It would have made an enormous difference, but at the same time we
understand the impact it was having on businesses," McCorkle said.

Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say



By Dean Calbreath
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
March 22, 2001
Until this week, the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce was predicting
that the county was well-insulated from the growing threat of economic
recession.
But that was before the lights went out in the chamber's downtown
headquarters Monday.
Working by window light in his darkened office, chamber economist Kelly
Cunningham rapidly erased his previous projections for 3.5 percent growth for
San Diego County. Cunningham now feels the local economy could fall into a
recession thanks to its shaky supply of energy.

"Blackouts are very disruptive to the economy," Cunningham said. "A business
can absorb rising energy prices by cutting costs or raising its own prices.
But an energy shutoff is much less predictable. It cuts into productivity."
Those sentiments are being echoed throughout California, as business leaders
and economists worry that rolling blackouts will darken the state's
previously glowing economy.
At the University of California Los Angeles, for instance, leading financial
theorists will meet April 4 to discuss the question "Can California grow in
the dark?" Although the topic was chosen before the recent string of power
outages, the blackouts have given the issue new urgency.
"These blackouts are not just a single episode," said UCLA economist Tom
Lieser. "They are a bridge to what will happen this summer. If we don't fall
into a recession in the second half of the year, we will fall pretty close."
Tapan Munroe, an economist formerly with Pacific Gas and Electric, this week
crossed out his projection for 2 percent statewide growth. After blackouts
rolled toward his consulting offices in the Bay Area city of Moraga, Munroe
decided the state will be lucky if it manages zero growth.
"I'm a pretty optimistic guy by nature, but this has been sobering," Munroe
said. "On Tuesday, one restaurant alone in San Francisco lost $20,000.
Multiply that by all of the businesses that lost power in the state and
you've got a serious problem."
Two days of blackouts in San Diego County have hurt businesses large and
small. Among the industries under threat is the local biotechnology sector,
which requires a steady supply of electricity to power areas of laboratories
that must remain temperature-controlled and sterile.
Continued blackouts "could have a huge impact, not only in dollars, but
multiple millions of dollars," said Tom Oster, vice president of operations
for BioCom, the leading trade organization for the more than 200 biotechs in
San Diego County.
Idun Pharmaceuticals, a biotech near La Jolla Village Drive that has 67
employees, had its power cut for about 40 minutes Tuesday. Though the company
has a back-up generator, some segments of its laboratories and lab equipment
were not supported by it. Chemists also had to turn off some sensitive lab
equipment to avoid the possibility of a damaging power surge once the
blackout was over.
"We're not in a position as a small company to back up the whole facility,"
said Steven Mento, Idun's chief executive. "We haven't done a survey yet to
determine whether we had losses, either in experiments or equipment damaged
-- but we're hoping because the blackout was so short that damage will be
minimal."
Mento said rolling blackouts, coupled with continuing high energy costs,
could cripple many small biotechs -- and even take a bite out of bigger, more
established companies.
"We generate new compounds in controlled environments on a daily basis, and
when power goes off you can lose samples because of contamination and other
issues," Mento said. "We are fortunate that our losses would be in having to
repeat an experiment -- but this could be really critical for companies with
drug manufacturing and issues of quality control."
The wireless firms along Sorrento Valley have not been immune from blackouts.
The lights went out at Qualcomm early this week, although executives declined
to comment about the impact.
No blackouts hit the big shipbuilding operations on the waterfront this week.
But the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. -- one of San Diego's largest
employers -- already experienced a voluntary loss of power this year, its
first since World War II. Since the shipyard does not have its own power
supply, NASSCO executives fear the effect of unplanned outages.
"Our average payroll totals half a million dollars a day," said NASSCO
spokesman Jim Scott. "When you have a day's work disrupted, that can be
pretty serious. We're currently in discussions about the possibility of
buying from independent power suppliers, or setting up a power plant of our
own."
Small businesses, which constitute the bulk of employment in San Diego
County, were hurt by disruptions as well -- costing them vital revenue at a
time when their power bills have skyrocketed.
At Fantastic Sam's, a hair salon in Chula Vista, Angelica Alcala estimated
that business dropped 60 percent when the blackouts hit Tuesday. Among other
things, Alcala had to alter her planned haircuts because she was relying on
scissors instead of electric clippers.
At the Family Fun Center in El Cajon, the management gave vouchers or refunds
to the 15 or so video-game players who were in the midst of killing aliens or
fighting ninja warriors as the power went down.
Papa John's Pizza estimates that it may have lost several thousand dollars in
business after six stores were blacked out Monday and four others lost power
Tuesday. Brian Mills, who runs 23 Papa John's stores in the county, said his
main concern was shutting down the computers so they would not be damaged by
a power surge when the electricity was restored.
Paul Ecke III, a member of the West Coast advisory panel for the Federal
Reserve, said the potential impact of the energy crisis "is worse than any
downturn in the stock market."
Ecke, who runs the Paul Ecke Ranch flower operation in Encinitas, said the
crisis could be particularly harmful for the state's agricultural sector,
since farmers need electricity to pump water and natural gas to heat
greenhouses.
"What I'm really worried about is the energy thing is going to cast a shadow
on California," he said. "If you're a business person thinking about moving
to California right now, you're probably not going to do it because you're
not sure you're going to have your lights on this summer."
Besides the disruption to businesses, the energy crisis is also hurting the
pocketbooks of hourly workers who have been sent home during the crisis.
Under state law, employers are free to send hourly workers home without pay
during such emergencies, although salaried workers must still be paid.
Susan Kemp, an attorney with the California Chamber of Commerce, said there
are ways of minimizing the impact on hourly workers.
"You have to look at what time it is when the blackout occurs and how long
you think it's going to last," Kemp said. "If it's around a meal time, you
might send the workers out for a longer meal period if you think it's going
to be an hour or hour and a half delay."
But the potential for losing wages doesn't sit well with the hourly workers.
"When you get sent home early and lose your wages, you have even less money
to pay your inflated energy bills," said an hourly worker who was sent home
during Monday's blackout.

Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority



By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 22, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) At least three major out-of-state electricity generators are
challenging the authority of the California Public Utilities Commission to
investigate whether they deliberately reduced power supplies to drive up
prices.
The PUC has asked for power plant maintenance records as it tries to
determine whether Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and other
wholesalers have manipulated the energy market at California's expense.
At issue is who ultimately controls oversight of in-state plants that provide
most of California's electricity. The plants, once owned by the state's
largest utilities, were sold off as part of the state's 1996 attempt at
deregulation.

PUC President Loretta Lynch said the public deserves to know whether
generators have unnecessarily taken plants off-line to create artificial
shortages, forcing the utilities and now state bureaucrats to buy much higher
priced power on the spot energy market.
"What I do know is we have historically high levels of outages across the
board," Lynch told The Associated Press. "Dynegy and Duke have been fighting
the PUC in the PUC's quest to obtain documents about these outages."
The PUC has the authority to regulate facilities within its borders, she
added. "It doesn't matter where the headquarters of the company is."
Duke, based in North Carolina, says it does matter ) and that since it and
other wholesalers aren't headquartered in California, the PUC can't require
it to turn over the maintenance records.
"We have not given them proprietary information because they do not regulate
us," said Duke's spokesman, Tom Williams.
Dynegy did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
The PUC also faces a new challenge in the legislature. A bill sponsored by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which would have granted the
PUC greater inspection authority over out-of-state generators, was amended
this month to grant the authority to Independent System Operator instead.
The ISO has managed the delivery of energy through most of the state's power
grid but historically has done little regulating and has had no policing
authority.
This board, created during the state's 1996 attempt at deregulation, was
redesigned in January. Now it has a five-member board appointed by Davis,
replacing a 26-member ISO board composed of utility executives, marketers,
power plant owners and others.
The latest version of Migden's bill requires wholesalers to report monthly to
the ISO about any plants that are off-line or working at reduced capacity,
and give

Hello all:

The time has come again for Bowl for Kid's Sake!  Entergy-Koch is sponsoring
the event this year which will raise money for the children of Big
Brothers-Big Sisters of Greater Houston.  BBBS offers youth mentoring
programs to at-risk children, and their goal is to match children from
single-parent families with responsible, adult role models.

Last year, our team raised over $1500, and this year our team goal is $3000.
The company goal is to raise $350,000 in total.  The minimum pledge per pin
is $.10 (100 score minimum), or a flat pledge of $10.  Either method works,
but be careful on the pledge per pin donation (I have been studying the
moves of Roy Munson and Ernie McCracken from the movie Kingpin).

If you are interested, please reply with your phone number, address, and
pledge amount (you will be billed directly in the mail by BBBS).

For those of you who are also interested in supporting our efforts in
person, the fundraiser will take place on Thursday, March 7th  from
2:00-4:30 at Palace Lanes, 4191 Bellaire Blvd (713-667-6554).

Thanks again to those who could contribute last year.  We hope to have just
as much success this time!

Just wanted to thank everybody who works with Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Our former three year deal with them expired September 30.  Last week, we
(finally) executed a new contract that keeps HPL as their largest natural gas
supplier through September 30, 2002.  Also, when their volumes go up in early
2001, they will once again be HPL's single largest industrial customer.

Everybody's hard work in keeping this customer happy has paid off.  Although
they can be very demanding to work with (particularly now that they are part
of Exxon), they know that HPL provides them the best overall service.

Please pass on thanks to anyone I've left off the list who has worked with
Mobil Beaumont Refinery.

Have a great 2001.

Oil companies say North Slope gas pipeline too pricey
09/27/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
ANCHORAGE (AP) - Oil companies looking into the feasibility of building a natural gas pipeline from Alaska's North Slope to the Lower 48 say the project is too pricey.
A preliminary analysis of the proposed project by Exxon Mobil, BP and Phillips Petroleum shows that the pipeline project would not provide them with what they want; a 15 percent return on their money.
The project works out to a 10 percent to 11 percent rate of return.
"We see this as a very high risk project," Robbie Schilhab of Exxon Mobil told Gov. Tony Knowles' natural gas development team meeting this week in Anchorage.
Schilhab and Phillips Petroleum's Joe Marushack presented their preliminary conclusions at a task force meeting.
Whether the pipeline runs north through the Arctic Ocean to Canada's Mackenzie River delta or south along the Alaska Highway through Canada to the Lower 48, the answer is the same: for now, the project looks too expensive for Alaska's oil companies to undertake.
For both the northern Arctic route and the southern Alaska Highway route, the costs would be huge: $15.1 billion for the offshore route and $17.2 billion for the highway route.
"I think this could be made attractive to a number of investors," said Ken Thompson, a former oil company executive who sits on the governors' natural gas team. Thompson said that tax incentives, a lower return on investment and a higher value for liquid natural gas from the pipe would make the project a worthwhile investment.
If the oil companies are not interested, natural gas transportation companies such as Williams, El Paso or Enron might be, Thompson said.
Exxon, Phillips and BP are still refining their analysis of the project. But the two executives made clear that they consider the project a long shot both for its high costs and high risks.
Schilhab said that opportunity remained to make the project an attractive investment by cutting construction costs. The companies also want to streamline the permitting process to avoid delays.
The presentation dented but did not destroy the optimism of the governor's gas council.
"I don't like seeing the number. But it's a lot different from saying no way, no how, we're shutting our doors and going home," said Pat Pourchot, state commissioner of natural resources. Pourchot said that the producers' position underlined the need for incentives like federal tax breaks similar to those being proposed by the Knowles administration.
Exxon, BP and Phillips are split on the incentives. To address the risk of low prices, Phillips wants a tax credit if prices fall below a certain level. BP and Exxon say they want a project that is viable without tax breaks.
Federal legislation is slated for consideration next week in Washington, D.C.
INDIA: State-run Indian firms don't want Enron's assets.
09/27/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
NEW DELHI, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Leading state-run firms have rejected proposals from financial institutions to acquire assets of U.S. energy firm Enron's Dabhol Power Co, officials said on Thursday.
Enron wants to sell its 65-percent stake in Dabhol Power Co which is embroiled in a payments dispute with a local utility.
Officials said some financial institutions had suggested National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC), Oil and Natural Gas Corp and Gas Authority of India Ltd could buy the troubled Dabhol Power Co's assets.
NTPC Chairman C.P. Jain told reporters the company had written to the federal government that it was not interested in the project. "We don't think it is a commercially viable proposition for the organisation."
Officials said financial institutions had also proposed that ONGC and GAIL could buy the LNG import and regasification facilities of the Dabhol plant south of Bombay.
ONGC Chairman Subir Raha said ONGC was not interested. "Right now it is not on our table. We are not considering it," he told reporters.
Dabhol's first phase has a generating capacity of 740 MW. It has been idling since May when Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), its only customer, stopped buying power saying it was too costly and that Enron had violated a part of the contract.
Dabhol's second phase was 97 percent complete when further construction was stopped because of the dispute.
The first phase used naphtha as fuel, but the second phase, that will have a generating capacity of 1,444 MW, will use LNG as fuel.

ANY FAINT HOPES about the murky Dabhol Power Project crisis being sorted out by the contracting parties - the Enron Corporation, the Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB), the State Government and the Centre which provided the sovereign guarantee in favour of Dabhol Power Company - now appear to have been ruined by the Maharashtra Government's resort to "the theatre of the absurd".
The decision of the Vilasrao Deshmukh Government to have a judicial probe into the entire Enron deal abinitio is not a mere exercise in evasion of the responsibility of the State Government to strive for a process of renegotiation of the contract perceived to be loaded against the virtually bankrupt MSEB (which is unable to pay for power purchased from the Dabhol Plant-Phase I); what is involved is a brazen blackmailing strategy through which the State Government perhaps hopes to drive the Enron Corporation down to its knees to settle for an exit course at a substantial discount on its equity stake, estimated at $1.2 billion. The Centre is not blissfully unaware that its own obligation as a surety for the State Government is now seen as an empty promise with all its pervasive adverse image of the country as an undependable and vulnerable investment destination.
The reported remark of the Union Minister for Power, Mr. Suresh Prabhu, that the new twist to the Enron tangle is "unfortunate" but that it would not affect foreign investments in the future, in the power sector in India, is indeed adding insult to injury.
The script, as it is unfolding in the Enron muddle, can leave nobody in doubt that from the very beginning the contract has had a large element of political manipulation driving it. The allegation that the Enron Corporation was able to manoeuvre itself into a power purchase agreement which was decidedly exhorbitant in power tariff owing to the "padding" of capital cost and the denomination of tariffs in U.S. dollar terms (apart from the use of naptha as feedstock) is said to have been corroborated by the Madhav Godbole Renegotiation Committee set up by the State Government. Assuming that a whole chain of bureaucratic scrutiny from the Power Ministry at the Centre down to the MSEB, over a four-year period, did not unravel the odious features of the Enron contract, how does it exonerate the MSEB, the State Government and the Centre now, from non-compliance with the contract in its different stages?
Political muck-raking, which is what is now being sought to be substituted by the Vilasrao Deshmukh Government (with the tacit approval of the Congress High Command) for an honourable modusvivendi on the Enron imbroglio, can never pass muster so long as the arbitration clause in the Enron contract cannot be wished away. It would indeed be a reckless misadventure for the Vajpayee Government to let the Maharashtra Government renege on the power purchase agreement with the Dabhol company and simply watch the disintegration of India's first-ever and much-vaunted mega power plant put up on the basis of foreign investment. Given the deplorable inadequacies in the power infrastructure in the country even after ten years of liberalisation and the demonstrated incapacity to add even 5000 MW of power generation capacity a year, it would be utter folly to abandon the Dabhol project without its full capacity of around 2000 MW being leveraged for the industrial advancement of the country.
Reports indicate that the U.S.-based Enron Corporation has expressed a desire to quit from the Dabhol project. The Indian financial institutions which have a substantial exposure to the capital cost of the project cannot afford to wait in supplication for some miracle to happen for the Dabhol project to stay afloat. It is no less a challenge to them as to the Vajpayee Government to find a way out of the morass. Let the project be revived as an earnest of India's commitment to development rather than be rubbished as a monument of political corruption.

Wood Signals That El Paso's FR Contracts Are High on Agenda
FERC denied rehearing of a June order that permits Arizona Public Service Co. to assign its full-requirements (FR) capacity contract on El Paso Natural Gas to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy to serve a new gas-fired generation facility that it is building in Arizona. On the surface, it seemed a clear victory for the companies involved. However, Chairman Pat Wood made it very clear that he has concerns about FR service on El Paso, which entitles customers to unlimited capacity at frozen rates, and that he plans to take up the issue at a later date.
"I will reluctantly go along with the order denying rehearing, but [I] look forward very aggressively to a forum in which we can address the capacity concerns" on El Paso, Wood said Wednesday during a marathon Commission meeting, the first over which he presided [CP01-90, RP00-336]. The proper forum for discussion of the FR service will be El Paso's Order 637 proceeding, he noted.
As a lawyer, "it's hard for me...to find an excuse to grant rehearing here. Because this is not the appropriate docket to do that, I will concede that after four months of being browbeat into submission...that sometimes you ought to fold up," Wood said. "But I remain concerned about the [interplay] on the pipeline that if we don't engage in some long-term planning," the situation could "lead to a bedsore for the customers out there in the Southwest."
The new chairman made clear that he was not "a fan or supporter of 10-year rate freezes or any extended rate freezes" that are made available to certain FR customers. "I understand that there's a tremendous disincentive here because of that for needed expansions to occur," Wood noted.
He openly invited parties to challenge at the Commission the limits of FR service. He noted that FR customers "seem to have an unbounded upper-end, which I would love the opportunity to [address] if we ever get a contested pleading to define exactly just how full full-requirements can be."
The "interplay" of frozen rates and unlimited access to pipeline capacity in a "growth part of the country that needs to have generation [makes for] a very complicated pipeline scenario," Wood said.
In the June order, FERC gave the go-ahead for El Paso to construct and operate two delivery points and about six miles of lateral pipeline to provide service to the proposed gas-fired electric generation facilities of Pinnacle West and Duke Energy Maricopa LLC in Maricopa County, AZ. Pinnacle's 2,120 MW Redhawk power plant will require about 410 MMcf/d of gas, while Duke's 1,000 MW Arlington Valley plant will burn 210 MMcf/d. Both plants have scheduled in-service dates of June 1, 2002.
Major producers and other El Paso shippers attacked El Paso's plan to provide FR service of 410 MMcf/d to the Redhawk plant, arguing that the service would further constrain an already capacity-tight El Paso system. Specifically, they objected to El Paso's plan to assign the FR contract (66,042 MMBtu/d) of Arizona Public Service to affiliate Pinnacle West Energy, as well as give a "huge increase" in the contract amount in order to serve the Redhawk plant. The protestors further argued that the plan would give Pinnacle West Energy a competitive rate advantage over existing contract-demand customers on the pipeline.
Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company Building New Pipeline
09/27/2001
Business Wire
(Copyright (c) 2001, Business Wire)
BISMARCK, N.D.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Sept. 27, 2001--Calling it the "largest pipeline construction project in company history," executives from Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company announced today their intent to file for federal regulatory approval to construct 245 miles of 16-inch natural gas pipeline spanning sections of Wyoming, Montana and North Dakota.
The pipeline, expected to begin approximately 14 miles north of Gillette, Wyoming, and end south of Killdeer, North Dakota, initially would be capable of transporting from 80 to 120 million cubic feet of gas per day. "Additional pipeline transportation capacity could be added incrementally as natural gas production grows in the coalbed and other conventional fields in Wyoming and Montana, ultimately increasing the pipeline transportation volumes on this pipeline to as much as 200 million cubic feet per day," said Tony Finneman, executive vice president and general manager of Williston Basin.
"In essence, we're looking to construct a `just-in-time' pipeline for the amount of natural gas being produced in the Powder River Basin, and we'll add capacity in step with increases in production," said Finneman, who announced the project today during the Fifth Annual Wyoming Natural Gas Fair in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Initially, the pipeline is expected to feature three large compressor stations - one on the south end of the route in Wyoming, another in eastern Montana and the third in North Dakota. Additional transportation capacity through the pipeline can be made available by adding more compression facilities.
The pipeline would transport natural gas from developing coalbed and conventional natural gas production in central Wyoming and south central Montana to interconnecting pipelines that will transport it to large midwestern markets. "The pipeline would also enhance access to our large natural gas storage facilities in eastern Montana," Finneman said. Availability of storage should be an advantage to large-volume consumers, such as utility companies and large industrial facilities, because they can buy natural gas when prices are low and store it for future use.
Finneman said Williston Basin will be filing the project with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) in October. The selection of the pipeline's route is nearly complete and initial surveying work has begun. With FERC approval, construction could begin as early as the third quarter of 2002, with transportation service slated to begin in late 2002.
Williston Basin Interstate Pipeline Company provides natural gas transportation and underground storage through a pipeline system in Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota and Wyoming. Williston Basin is an indirect subsidiary of MDU Resources Group, Inc., a multidimensional natural resource enterprise traded on the New York Stock Exchange as "MDU."

a federal judge in the United States ruled that thousands of former
Filipino, Chinese, and Korean prisoners of war who claim that they were used
as slave labour by Japanese companies during World War II may not sue for
damages in U.S. courts. U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that
the Treaty of Peace signed by the United States and a multitude of other
nations bars so-called slave labourers from seeking damages from Japanese
companies for work that may have been tantamount to slave labour. The court
decided that allowing the suits to carry on would "unsettle half a century
of diplomacy." The judge ruled a year ago that Americans were barred from
similar suits. See " Judge

FOR SAFE SKIES: On September 25, 2001, representatives of the International
Transport Workers Federation (ITF) told the General Assembly of the
International Civil Aviation Organisation that market forces have failed to
provide "safe skies," an argument long made by industry officials. The ITF
stated that the refrain from industry officials that the "least cost safe
option" of having market forces provide for transportation safety has
failed, and that the industry must now work with unions to develop new
methods of dealing with terrorism. The ITF has pledged the support of its
600,000 worldwide airline workers to help achieve a fundamental reform of
safety and security standards. See " ITF Statement On

25, 2001, port workers across Europe staged work stoppages to protest
against proposed port reforms. The International Transport Workers
Federation (ITF) has warned that measures in the proposed reform plans would
"encourage shippers to demand lower tariffs and prices via unsafe working
conditions, relaxed safety standards and the use of untrained personnel -
leading to the creation of dangerous and sub-standard ports." The ITF has
joined together with the UK Government, the Federation of European Private
Port Operators, and the European Sea Port Organisation in opposing the
reform plans. See " ITF Statement On

the case at issue announced that he would go on sick leave for at least
three months. The following day he submitted a medical certificate, stating
he had a tumor on his hand. The tumor, however, would not necessarily have
kept the employee from working. The court therefore held that the employee's
behaviour was clearly an attempt to "punish" the employer and that it
therefore would justify a termination for cause. See " Threat Of

AGREEMENTS: The German Federal Labour Court recently ruled on that in case

do not necessarily supersede other collective regulations applicable to the
employees of the acquired company. In the respective case, the buyer
acquired a company that was previously bound by a collective bargaining
agreement that provided for annual extra payments. The buyer was not a
member of the respective employers' association and therefore not bound by
the respective collective bargaining agreement. The court ruled, however,
the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement became part of the
individual employment contracts of the employees in accordance with the
German Civil Code. Since the acquired company was located in another city
than the buyer's company, provisions of the collective bargaining agreement
were also not superseded by shop agreements applicable to the buyer's
company. According to the Court, these shop agreements are applicable only
to the employees of the respective plant location but not to the employee of
the acquired company. See " Transfer  <http://bundesarbeitsgericht.de/> of

establish stakeholder pension plans for "relevant employees." The
requirements may apply to an employer that employs individuals in the UK,
whether that employer is UK-based or a multinational. These stakeholder
plans are intended to be an economical form of personal pension plan
targeted at low to middle income earners so as to encourage more people to
save for their old age. See " Pension  <http://www.bmck.com/gel/articles/UK-

SK - I printed this & put it in your working group file.  mm

Team--attached are my group's top 10 objectives at the headquarters level and
at the in-country level for the international PR, marketing communication and
social responsibility areas.

How we prioritize

We arrive at these objectives after discussion with heads of the business
units and senior management, and we focus on goals that support the priority
business goals of the company and build/protect the reputation of the company
as a whole.  On a quarterly basis (at least) we review these top objectives
and ensure that we are staying on target.  Internationally, we are faced with
numerous issues and crises which must be dealt with and they also take on a
priority spot when they occur.

There is an issue with prioritization that we must constantly deal with.
Some of our clients are PR savvy and wish to use our services, which should
please us except that sometimes small, low priority and visibility projects
use too much of our time that should be spent elsewhere.  Conversely, we
sometimes have important projects that the developer wishes to keep low
budget and we are not allowed to have the level of input that we should.

How human and financial resources are allocated

The bulk of our human resources currently are allocated to the regions, and
the structure is an area in transition since the reorganization and in light
of several open positions that we have.  We determine in conjunction with the
business units the proper number and level of staff.  The regional PR head
determines how his or her junior people are assigned.  At the headquarters
level, we focus on the activities that benefit the company overall as well as
top priority countries.  Marketing communication maintains adequate staff to
meet customer demands, and adds temporary staff during peak periods.

We all work on the highest priority items for the year, but also tend to
focus on issues of the moment that are of greatest significance to the
business unit leaders.   My goal is to keep people focused on the long-term
objectives for the year and not get caught up in the day to day operations
without this long term focus.  If there is an area I would like to further
refine, it is making sure that we are better deploying our human resources on
what is important.

How financial resources are allocated

We have a PR budget for each operating company, for international
headquarters, for marketing services and for sustainable development.  At the
regional level, figures are projected for each country and/or project and
these are discussed with the various country leaders.  Headquarters budget is
used for activities that benefit all areas and not one region or country.

Marketing communication budget is on a bill-back basis (the most difficult to
predict because it is comprised of costs for developing presentations and
other marketing/sales tools.  This has been a trait of the former EI and is
the expectation of developers--if you need it for marketing purposes you do
it.)  As you will note in my objectives, I would like this department to
arrange a billing system including their time and fixed costs that allows
them to be completely self-supporting rather than allocating across business
units.  This will encourage people to use their services more wisely.

When a new project is being pursued, budgets are approved for all aspects of
the project including PR, employee communication and social responsibility.
The social responsibility budgets typically fall short or are non-existent,
and this is another area that we will be focusing on changing this year.

How this fits with budgeting process

Our allocation of resources is linked directly with our budgeting process.
There are two exceptions:

1--pursuing major projects that were not planned at the beginning of the
year.  Budgets for these new pursuits are approved during the overall project
approval process, and again, we must work to have greater input in this
process.

2--costs for resolving major crises such as Cuiaba and Human Rights Watch
have been significant and were not pre-budgeted.

I was disappointed,  to say the least, at the return email I received from you so I waited before replying so as not to react in haste. Previously I stuck to facts and did not bring things of a personal nature into the equation. I feel, however, that there are a few things you should know about me and how I have exemplified the ENRON VISION so you can realize why I took this so seriously and why am, to be blunt, ticked off at the resolution.
In the 4 years that I worked on the scheduling desk for Clinton I never missed a day of work.........not one.
I never took vacation during bid week or during tie out time.
Between 96 - 00 I took all but 3 days vacation between the months of May - October so as not to interfere with winter gas operations.
I have had nothing but above average reviews in the past 5 years,  been promoted twice, and received special recognition for working shorthanded through the winter of 99-00.
As you can see I have consistently put ENRON ahead of personal conveniences and strived to do the right thing for the company. I am distressed that the very values Enron holds me to ring hollow with regards to how I have been treated.
Changing vacation rules, be it legally legitimate, does not exemplify INTEGRITYin my eyes!
Not stating a policy change (THERE HAS STILL NEVER BEEN A FORMAL STATEMENT OF THIS CHANGE) does not illustrate COMMUNICATION!
Stating that I will be paid for vacation less any I take between now and the severance date is deceptive at the least and would not constitute RESPECT, EXCELLENCE nor INTEGRITY!
FACT - items 1 - 6 in the original email are 100% true. #2 is of the most significance as the words came from the lips of our HR representative that I would be paid the vacation amount we discussed UNLESS I TOOK ANY VACATION BETWEEN NOW AND JUNE 1st.
FACT - At least 2 people were allowed vacation time off during this transition (Susan Weison, Sheri Wallace)
FACT - If you check my vacation records you will find that I have taken a vacation EVERY YEAR IN MAY. My request was made, like in all previous years, a few weeks before I wanted to take it. HAD I KNOWN THAT THE RULES OF THE GAME WERE GOING TO BE CHANGED I WOULD HAVE MADE MY INTENTIONS KNOWN EARLIER.
In conclusion I do not expect, or even wish for a response. I have enjoyed my time with Clinton Energy and Enron. I have learned much and forwarded my career greatly and for that I am thankful. I just wanted you to know where I am coming from and how an unfortunate situation of severance was turned into one in which I leave being taught a lesson by Enron that does not make me a better person, just a smarter one. This lesson; a spotless record & loyalty to a company means very little. It is better to look out for #1. In the end the company you work for is going to protect their best interests regardless of the rhetoric in their Vision Statement. Thank you for your time.
Respectfully,

Here is a quick summary of our meeting on capacity options on TW.  Bill
Cordes, Steve Harris, Shelley Corman, John Buchanan, Tony Pryor, and members
of the TW Commercial Group (including Jeff Fawcett) were present.

1.  The group all agreed that while it is probably a good idea to mention
that the options could be sold in an online format, we do not want to limit
ourselves at this point and should probably just state that a notice will be
posted on the TW website whenever we have options for sale.

2.  Price:  the filing needs to include a discussion of how price will be
determined, and how capacity will be awarded.  We might also need to include
an estimate of how much revenue options will generate in the first year.

3.  Need to add a short explanation of where TW will get the capacity if a
shipper exercises its call option.

4.  Should frame the service as requiring an exception to current Commission
policy on reserving capacity...not asking Commission to abandon its policy
altogether.

5.  May need to address:  assignability of options; limitation on damages
for nonperformance.

6.  Timeline:
- Turn around a new draft and get further comments (July 3 week)
- Get Market Services started on its analysis of the new service
- Begin contacting customers to get their buy-in (Lorraine already has a
producer/customer very interested in supporting our filing)
- Start the process of getting Board approval (sales of options require
Board approval at Enron)
- Meet informally with FERC to discuss (Shelley is working on)
- Make the filing at FERC (we did not try to specify a date yet)

If you have any further comments please let me know.  I am going to try to
get a new draft out by next Friday a.m.

The market received the announcement of Larry's retirement and Bill's
succession very calmly.   I talked to each of our analysts and elaborated a
bit on the news and answered their questions:
- Why is Larry leaving?  Was there any "hidden" reason?
-  What is Bill's background?
- Does this signal any change in strategy or direction from Enron?
- Do we anticipate any other change in the business as a result of this
management change?
Several said that "since this seems to not be a big change (in direction or
strategy), I'm not going to write anything on it".
The unit price did not reflect much change.   The units opened Monday (the
day of the news) at $29, blipped up some 3/16  just after the press release,
and then settled back to the opening price.   Tuesday opened strong, trended
up $.50 in heavy volume and then again settled to $29.   Wednesday's price
closed up 1/16, at $29.0625.
Daily volumes were:  Monday 27,400 units
Tuesday 50,200 units
Wednesday 20,800 units
We were hoping to communicate that this would be a fairly seamless transition
and continue NBP's history of solid, fairly conservative management, and it
appears that the market interpretted it exactly that way.

Mark-

Sorry for the delay in getting this to you...I've been struggling to find some more concrete information to rest an analysis on, but until we see Transco's supplemental testimony and the Commission Staff's "top sheets", it's very hard to predict where the case will come out.  Following, however, are some known variables that will effect the outcome of Transco's proposed increase:

Rate of Return on Equity

Transco filed for a 15.05% equity return (compared with the 12.4% recently affirmed by the FERC in the RP97-71 docket).
Transco based their filed number on a restructured "proxy group", which was revised by their witness to include Kinder Morgan, ElPaso Energy Partners, and Northern Border Partners (these were added to ElPaso, Enron and Williams).
Adding these entities has the effect of raising the high end of the range of DCF returns from 14.56& to 17.52%
The effect of the 260 basis point increase to return on equity amounts to $61million, or approx. 27% of the requested increase.
Protests on this issue were filed chiefly by the New York PSC and PSE&G.
The NYPSC Protested mainly the change in the structure of the proxy group, citing the fact that the new entities added by Transco's witness are owned in substantial part by existing members of the proxy group.
The NYPSC asked for an expedited hearing on the development of a new proxy group--FERC declined to establish an expedited hearing but did set this issue for the hearing to be conducted before Judge Harfield.
PSE&G's complaint was based primarily on the fact that Transco cannot failed to demonstrate significant financial risk sufficient to justify the higher return rate.
PSE&G cited Transco's continuance of SFV rate design as a risk mitigation factor that cannot allow Transco to seek a higher return.  (PSE&G and UGI have indicated that they will be seeking a "Substantial Shift" from SFV rates in this case.  They sought a 35% shift in the Texas Gas case.

1Line costs

Transco's filing contains approx. $60million representing their allocation of costs for Williams new 1Line system.
Several parties (including NYPSC, KeySpan, PECO) protested the level of costs, questioning the allocation of over 1/2 of the total costs to Transco.
Transco's main risk with respect to these costs is the fact that the FERC accepted and suspended the 1Line tariff sheets until September 1, making it nearly impossible for Transco to move the system into production prior to the end of the RP01-245 base period.  If Transco cannot demonstrate that the 1Line system is "used and useful" prior to the end of the base period, they will technically be unable to recover these costs in this docket.
However, nothing precludes the costs being included in any settlement of the docket.  Essentially, Transco will eventually recover these costs (whether at the $60m level or somewhere near that), but if they cannot get the system up and running prior to the end of the base period, they'd have to make a separate limited Section 4 filing to recover them.

Roll-in
Mobile Bay
Transco included a roll-in of the $120m Mobile Bay project in this case, based on a previously granted predetermination in favor of roll-in from FERC
The roll-in was protested by several LDC customers, who claimed that the $40m cost over run associated with the project represents enough of a change in circumstances to negate any presumption in favor of roll-in.
SunBelt, Pocono & Cherokee
Transco filed for prospective roll-in of these projects.  The suspension order set out the appropriate Policy Statement to be applied to the projects, applying the 1999 Policy Statement which eliminates any presumption in favor of roll-in and places the burden of the costs squarely on the incremental shippers.  Since roll-in is generally not a "settleable" issue, determination of this issue will be dependent on the outcome of the hearing.

The main issue with respect to predicting the rate level for the 2001-02 season is that the FERC Staff has indicated that settlement discussions should not begin until all of the testimony rounds are completed and the Staff files it's top sheets...meaning that the motion rates could go into effect on September 1 before a single settlement session is held.  Transco has indicated that they'd like to speed up the process so they can move rates into effect in September that reflect settlement progress.

It's difficult to predict the net effect of disposition of these issues--but it's safe to assume that the FERC will act to bring the return number down to a level consistent with the January order, which would knock out 25-27% of the requested increase.  I'll continue to update you as soon as any new information comes in or when I can get a better sense for what rate we'll be looking at for September.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?
ie their decision whether to trade or not.

Hi Guys

The following matters were discussed with Gay Wisbey, Paul Richardson and Ted
Morris of the Markets & Exchanges Division of the FSA.

FSA's view is that as more and more trading activity is moving from
traditional exchanges to proprietary electronic platforms the distinction
between the two is becoming blurred.  Currently, FSA has regulatory oversight
over both exchanges and firms which conduct regulated activity via their own
electronic platforms but the regulatory regime applicable to each differs.
In the light of this FSA is considering implementation of a dedicated
regulatory regime for alternative trading platforms (ATSs) so that regardless
of whether business is conducted via an exchange or an electronic platform,
FSA would be able to monitor price transparency, transaction transparency,
market depth and robustness of systems supporting the platform.  As far as
the current situation is concerned FSA mentioned that even before
implementation of a specific ATS regime they would like electronic platform
operators such as Enron to keep FSA informed of any squeezes in the market
which become apparent to our traders - this seemed to be related to
EnronOnline activity vs offline activity.  This is clearly not something we
do now for offline deals.

Regulation of the EnronOnline platform could result in:

a) monitoring of the platform and activity on it particularly in terms of
operational robustness with no additional regulation of products quoted on
EnronOnline;
b) regulation of the trading of financial products (currently regulated
through EEFT arranging deals for ECTRIC) and physical products (currently
unregulated).  This could result in an anomolous situation where Enron's
offline physical trading is unregulated while online physical trading is
regulated.
c) increased concern as to the systemic risk which increased trading activity
via EnronOnline poses and therefore greater attention being paid to the
management of counterparty credit risk and capitalisation.

I suggest that we issue a guest user id to the FSA to enable them to monitor
prices on an ongoing basis.

FSA is releasing a discussion document re ATSs in late May.  Jonathan Marsh
is monitoring developments in this area and will liaise with Justin Boyd and
me as soon as the paper is published.  This should provide further insight
into their intentions.

Please let me know if you need any further information at this stage.

Regards

Amita

Greetings:
Hope everyone had a pleasant 4th.
I've read the respective Burton and Hertzberg language on amending AB 1X.
The Burton language looks cleaner and simpler, though there may be reasons to
include some of the Hertzberg language, too.
I'm proposing to the group the following as potential amendments to the bond
bill.  I would appreciate your feedback.  The amendments would be as follows:
Customers who were on Direct Access when DWR started buying power (Jan.
17th?), and are still on Direct Access when the bill passes, should be exempt
from paying for the bonds.
In short, customers should not be forced to pay for power twice--once from
their ESP, and once from DWR.  Since these customers receive power services
from their ESP, they never consumed DWR power in the first place and it
wouldn't be fair to require them to pay for it.
Customers who have been utility customers since DWR started buying power but
subsequently switched to Direct Access should only pay for power provided by
DWR that they actually consumed, no more and no less.
For example, if a customer was a utility customer when DWR started buying
power but switched to Direct Access on May 1st, then the customer would only
be responsible for reimbursing DWR for power deliveries that took place from
Jan. 17th thru April 30th.
I believe that we agreed on these concepts during the negotiations that took
place over the past 4-5 weeks.  Or if we didn't explicitly agree during the
talks, they seem to be principles on which we ought to be able to agree
pretty easily now. And rather than leave the issue hanging, which can create
unnecessary and costly uncertainty for customers, I suggest that we include
very clear and simple legislative language in the bond bill clarifying what
customers' obligations are.  Your thoughts are appreciated.
In addition, we have talked quite a bit about providing customers with
incentives in the attempt to get California out of the energy hole that it
finds itself in.  Providing (20KW and above) customers with an incentive to
switch to Direct Access as soon as possible could 1) reduce the net short
position that the state (and ultimately consumers) have to finance, thereby
reducing spot purchases and price volatility,  2) reduce electricity
purchasing costs, and 3) reduce the burden on the state budget.
With this in mind, I'm also proposing that the group consider an amendment to
the bond bill that would exempt from bond charges any customer that switches
to Direct Access by September 1st.
Finally, it seems odd that the language directing the PUC to suspend Direct
Access is still in the bill.  If a dedicated rate component is created, that
seems to eliminate altogether the need to suspend Direct Access.  And if
that's the case, would it make sense to delete that language from the bill?
Look forward to your comments and working with you to get support for and
passage of the "core/noncore" proposal.

We met with Edison yesterday in the attempt to settle our negative CTC claim.
Edison continues to take a very hard-line, extreme position.  This is it in a nutshell:
1.	all customers--bundled and DA alike--"contributed to Edison's undercollection" and all customers must pay it down;
2.	bundled customers contributed through frozen rates and DA customers contributed through the negative CTC;
3.	Edison says it will pay ESPs past due amounts related to the negative CTC, but it intends to then turn around and assess a charge on all customer bills--DA and bundled alike--to recover its undercollection.
4.	Edison intends to collect it over approximately 2 years.  Edison estimates that the charge to DA customers over this period would be about $25-27/MWH.
5.	Under Edison's plan, Enron would likely end up paying Edison, i.e., the present value of the "undercollection" charge would exceed the present value of the lump sum negative CTC payment.
Obviously, with respect to any settlement with Edison, we're extremely far apart and we're therefore considering other 	options.
In the meantime, the California PUC is engaged in DA and PX credit-related activities beginning next week and Edison 	will try to get the Commission to adopt their proposal.
We are working with other market participants and gearing up to vigorously oppose Edison's proposal at the PUC.
We will distribute something on Monday describing our approach and tactics at the PUC for folks to review and 	comment on.
We are scheduled to meet with Edison again next Thursday to try to knock some sense into them (the probability of 	which is low).

If you have any questions, let us know.

Best,
Jeff

Transmission lines project draws bidders
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 24, 2001)
Aiming to ease one of the festering problems in California's energy crisis,
13 companies and public agencies have bid for the right to widen a notorious
bottleneck in the state's transmission lines, federal officials said Monday.
The bidders range from the East Bay Municipal Utility District to wholesale
power generators such as Mirant Corp., Calpine Corp. and Williams Cos. Some
independent experts argue that if a generator wins the bid, it could use its
control over those transmission lines to manipulate the electricity market.
The bottleneck is Path 15, a narrow 90-mile stretch of power lines near Los
Banos that carries electricity between Northern and Southern California. It
has less transmission capacity than other portions of the power grid, which
has led to blackouts.
In January, Northern California suffered power outages in part because Path
15 couldn't deliver the surplus electricity that was available in Southern
California. The proposed expansion would add 1,500 megawatts of capacity.
"It's a very big issue; there's been a lot of congestion," said Severin
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute.
In addition, the Independent System Operator, which manages the power grid,
estimates the congestion generated by Path 15 added an estimated $221.7
million to California's power bill in a 16-month period that ended in
December.
Borenstein said he believes there are considerable hidden costs as well,
because the bottleneck has created an incentive for sellers to withhold
power. Path 15 effectively cuts California into two separate markets, making
it easier for sellers to manipulate each submarket to raise prices, he said.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which owns the existing Path 15 transmission
lines, already has been conducting environmental studies with an eye toward
widening the path. To speed things along, the federal government in May asked
for bids on the project, which sparked proposals from generators and others.
Borenstein said having a generator widen Path 15 could bring new problems.
Whoever builds the additional power lines owns them and can charge "tolls" to
companies that use the lines to transmit electricity. A power generator could
deliberately withhold supplies, thereby increasing the congestion on Path 15,
and increase the tolls, Borenstein said.
PG&E is among those bidding to widen the path. So is its sister company, an
unregulated entity called PG&E National Energy Group. Other bidders include a
partnership led by Sempra Energy Resources, an unregulated sister company of
San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
The federal government estimates it will take $300 million and three or four
years to widen Path 15. The costs are ultimately paid by utility customers.
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, speaking to reporters in Los Angeles
on Monday, called the expansion of Path 15 "a critical component in solving
the long-term power crisis in this state."

Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for
years


(Published July 24, 2001)
The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more
intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee
sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn
over internal documents.
Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has
adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple
investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has
become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.
At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted
criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love
to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a
tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With
less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based
companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor
suppliers to California.
Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that
Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of
President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the
rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are
interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also
filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading
data.
Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating
Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality
agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph
Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a
report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction."
Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's
happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears
about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would
data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data
be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands
of class-action attorneys?
Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will
be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative
purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of
turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was
leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that
private lawyers are working closely with investigators.
Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove
collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few
dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings,
that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create
artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted
the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent
System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that
ISO had ordered the plant operational changes.
Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now
under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents
that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation.
Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary.
Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help
in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said
he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides.
The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes
will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at
least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their
utility bill checks.

Initiative effort seeks to lower natural-gas prices
By Jim Miller
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 24, 2001)
Amid higher utility rates, the threat of rolling blackouts and legislative
indecision on how to solve California's energy problems, there is one
proposal to get voters involved.
A ballot initiative to let cities, counties and other public agencies, such
as municipal utilities and irrigation districts, buy and sell natural gas has
been cleared for signature collection by the secretary of state's office.
The initiative emerged from the office of Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza,
D-Merced, whose district includes three electricity-supplying irrigation
districts.
To Cardoza and others, putting public agencies in the natural-gas business
would result in lower gas and electricity prices for consumers because most
generators run on natural gas.
Cardoza's proposal is the first of what observers say could be several
energy-related measures on future ballots.
For months, consumer advocates have warned that they would use the initiative
process if they feel lawmakers are saddling taxpayers with the costs of the
state's botched energy deregulation.
"As soon as we find out what the Legislature has done or has not done this
fall, we'll react appropriately," said Jamie Court, executive director of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the groups considering an
initiative.
"If there's a bailout (of utilities), we'll go to the ballot box. If there
isn't a bailout, it's not clear what we'll do," Court said. "Right now, we're
fund raising to be able to have the capacity to do whatever needs to be
done."
The future of Cardoza's initiative is uncertain.
Since its approval by the secretary of state's office May 29, there has been
no effort to collect signatures or to raise money for a campaign. The
initiative needs the signatures of 670,816 registered voters by Oct. 26 to
qualify for the ballot.
The electric industry strongly opposes the Cardoza initiative.
"This came about during the winter because it looked like there was going to
be a natural-gas shortage," said Stephanie Espinosa, a spokeswoman for
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. "Since then, we've been able to provide
sufficient natural gas to our customers."
A recent poll, however, showed Californians may be in the mood to approve
energy-related ballot measures. The Public Policy Institute of California
poll found that 65 percent of all adults believe measures on the 2002 ballot
are the best way to solve the energy crisis. Thirty percent said the
Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis would provide the best solution.

Daniel Weintraub: There's no shame in doing nothing for Edison


(Published July 24, 2001)

To understand why state lawmakers are inching closer to handing over billions
of dollars of consumers' money to California's second-largest utility, you
need to appreciate the collective psyche of the Legislature. Not appreciate
as in enjoy. But appreciate in a scientific way, in the manner of an
anthropologist studying the mores of a foreign culture.
Confronted with a big problem, legislators think they need to solve it. Doing
nothing is not a comfortable option. It makes them feel ineffective and
impotent. When the governor is demanding a bill, the pressure grows even more
intense. They want to do something -- anything -- rather than having to go
back to their districts and admit that the problem is not theirs to fix.
In this case, though, doing nothing might be the wisest course.
Lawmakers now have on their desks three bills that take various approaches to
rescuing Southern California Edison from the brink of bankruptcy. The company
has a $3.5 billion debt left over from the state's failed experiment in
electricity deregulation. If something isn't done about it in the next few
weeks, the utility's future is likely to wind up in the hands of a judge.
But all three bills ignore a fundamental fact: Edison got itself into this
mess. Maybe the utility should get itself out.
Edison was a big cheerleader for the 1996 bill that restructured the way
electricity was bought and sold in California. Supporting a freeze on retail
rates, which was the centerpiece of that legislation, the company took a huge
gamble. If wholesale prices remained low, Edison would rake in billions by
capturing the difference between the price it paid for power and the much
higher price it was allowed to charge its customers. The money would go to
compensate the utility for power plants it built as a regulated monopoly,
plants that might no longer be profitable in a free-market, competitive
industry.
Like all gambles, this one came with a risk. If wholesale prices rose, they
might exceed the retail rate cap. Edison would be forced to sell its
electricity at retail for less than it was paying in the wholesale market.
The tide of dollars that flowed in so nicely would begin to flow back out
again.
And that's exactly what happened. Some of the world's smartest utility minds
guessed wrong. An electricity surplus turned into a shortage. Wholesale
prices soared. Things got so bad at Edison that the state stepped in to buy
power on the company's behalf.
But before things got ugly, Edison enjoyed two flush years of artificially
high rates. During 1998 and 1999, the company pocketed billions from its
customers, paid down debt and sent money to its parent firm, Edison
International.
Now Edison wants to divide the question. The money that flowed in, Edison
says, the company should get to keep. And the money that flowed out -- well,
that should be someone else's responsibility. The utility is asking the
Legislature to ignore the first two years of hefty profits and reimburse the
company for the one year of big losses.
Gov. Gray Davis negotiated his version of the Edison bailout several months
ago, but that deal was seen as so rich for the company that it went nowhere
in the Legislature. The Senate approved its version last week, a bill that
would reduce the payout to Edison by $1 billion and then stick business with
the remaining tab. The Assembly, meanwhile, is considering two other
measures, both of which would spread the pain between business and
residential consumers.
"This is corporate welfare at its worst," state Sen. Bill Morrow,
R-Oceanside, said of the Senate bill. "This is not even a bailout. It's a
corporate handout."
Edison and the state's other big utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which is
already in bankruptcy, say they are entitled to the money because they never
should have been put in the position of charging less for electricity than
they were paying to obtain it. That's a legal argument that belongs before a
judge. There is a good chance the court would want to balance the profits the
utilities made under deregulation with the losses they incurred. Under that
scenario, they wouldn't need a bailout.
But even if the utilities were to win their case, consumers probably would
fare no worse than they would under the various legislative proposals under
consideration.
Sen. Steve Peace, D-San Diego, who helped craft the 1996 bill that
restructured the industry and who now supports the Edison bailout, lectured
his fellow senators on the floor the other day about the need to take a risk.
"We can do nothing and be safe," Peace said. "Or we can do something, and do
our job."
Everyone is weary of the state's energy crisis. It is human nature to want to
get it behind us, to sweep it away, even at great cost. But lawmakers
shouldn't feel it's their job to "do something" -- especially when that thing
carries a multibillion-dollar price tag for consumers.
This time, doing nothing means standing up for ratepayers. What's the shame
in that?

State consultants don't see need for more rate hikes


\
objattph
Outlook brightens; price cut may be possible by 2003 By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 23, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- State consultants,
releasing a new estimate of power costs with an improved outlook, said
yesterday they do not believe an additional rate increase will be needed --
and a rate cut may be possible by 2003.  The state issued a long-awaited
"revenue requirement" asking for a little more than half of the revenue from
a record rate increase imposed by the state Public Utilities Commission
earlier this year.  The state power-purchasing agency, the Department of
Water Resources, wants 1.65 cents of an increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour
that began last month for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern
California Edison.
The PUC is not expected to rule on the state's revenue request until the
middle of next month, when the regulators also are scheduled to approve an
increase for the customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.  PG&E and Edison did
not immediately say whether the state's proposal would leave enough money for
the utilities. But as if expecting criticism, the state consultants said
utilities often ask for larger rate increases than they are granted.  An
adviser to Gov. Gray Davis said the administration was "mocked" by critics
when it forecast in April that the average cost of power would drop during
the summer, even though heat would drive up the demand for power.  "Quote:
'They just don't know what they are doing,' " consultant S. David Freeman
recalled the critics saying. "Well, we did know what we were doing. Quite
frankly, I think this is a good-news story of major proportions."  The widely
derided forecast issued in April said the average cost of power that must be
purchased on the expensive spot market would drop from $346 per megawatt-hour
in April through June to $195 in July through September.  Now the "reasonably
conservative" estimate is that the average price of power in July through
September will be $129 to $130 per megawatt-hour, said Ron Nichols of
Navigant Consulting.  Nichols attributed the price drop to a number of
factors: long-term contracts, cooler weather, cheaper natural gas used by
generators, more small and large generators back online and floating federal
price caps.  The state began buying power for utility customers Jan. 17 after
PG&E and Edison, whose rates were frozen by deregulation as wholesale power
costs soared, ran up massive debts and were no longer able to borrow.  The
consultants estimated that the state will have spent $13 billion on power by
the end of next year. But they also predicted that the state power-purchasing
fund would develop a substantial surplus by then.  "That would allow for a
rate decrease in 2003, based on our current projections," said Joseph Fichera
of Saber Partners.  The new revenue requirement issued by the state yesterday
is needed for a series of actions planned by the PUC next month to pay for a
record bond issue to repay the taxpayer-supported state general fund for
power purchases.  Fichera said that, despite reports to the contrary, the
recommendation is for a $12.5 billion bond -- leaving a cushion in the
authorization of $13.4 billion. The bond will be paid off by ratepayers over
15 years.  The consultants said their projection of state power costs is
cautious. They assume consumer conservation will drop from 7 percent to 6
percent, though it actually has been 11 percent and 12 percent in recent
months.  The projections are intended to leave some ability to absorb
unforeseen costs, such as scorching temperatures later this summer or next
summer, or a spike in natural gas prices as happened last winter.  The cost
projections do not include any overcharge refund from generators. Davis has
asked federal regulators for an $8.9 billion refund and has vowed to seek
full recovery in the courts.  The governor wants to get the state out of the
power-buying business by the end of next year. But that requires legislative
approval of a rescue plan for Edison that could become a model for getting
PG&E out of bankruptcy.  The Senate, which left for a monthlong recess after
approving a state budget early yesterday, approved an Edison rescue plan that
the utility says is too weak to restore its ability to borrow.  The Assembly
is struggling with two competing Edison rescue plans. Talks may continue
during the recess in an attempt to reach an agreement before the Aug. 15
deadline set by Davis to reach a deal to keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  The
consultants say there is enough room in the existing rates to give the two
utilities a revenue stream for bonds to pay off their debts -- 0.4 cent per
kilowatt-hour for Edison and 0.7 cent for PG&E.  Fichera said he disagrees
with speculation that falling power prices and the rate increase might give
Edison enough revenue to avoid bankruptcy without a legislative rescue plan.
To pay off Edison's $3.5 billion debt, he said, $2 billion would come from
the bond, but $1.5 billion would have to come from the sale of Edison's
transmission system to the state under the governor's plan.







Senate committee told Morgan Stanley destroyed power records


\

ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 23, 2001  SACRAMENTO ) Morgan Stanley, a multibillion
dollar financial firm and adviser to several power generators, destroyed
documents that potentially could show efforts to gouge California consumers )
and a state Senate committee wants to know why.  The company recently also
has come under the scrutiny of an Oregon lawmaker who is concerned the
company's purchase of the rights to move power between California and Oregon
could result in artificially high prices.  For several weeks, Morgan Stanley
had told the committee it would provide the documents, but said last week
they had been destroyed as a matter of routine "years ago," said Sen. Joe
Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee's chairman.  Members of the committee are
trying to determine whether power companies worked together to raise prices
by purposefully holding back electricity to drive up demand.  Morgan
Stanley's involvement would have been several years ago, when it advised
out-of-state energy companies to buy California power plants up for sale.  A
Morgan Stanley attorney told the Orange County Register that the company did
not destroy any documents after Dunn's committee requested the documents May
16.  "At the end of the project, they decided what they were going to keep
and what they weren't going to keep, and those decisions were made years
before the energy crisis and years before the committee existed," said Paul
Patono, a company attorney.  Dunn noted it is not illegal to raise prices as
long as a company doesn't collude to force prices upward.  Private utilities
became able to sell their plants as part of the 1996 plan to deregulate the
electricity market. Although the plants were expected to sell below their
book value, they instead sold for up to three times that price, although the
state then had an oversupply of electricity and old plants.  While the public
was told deregulation would lead to lower electricity prices, energy
officials and experts testifying before the committee have said it's unlikely
investors would buy aging power plants if they believed that to be true.
Dunn is curious if there was any kind of plan or advertising that said the
plants, if bought a certain way, would give of the buyers market power in the
wholesale electricity market.  The committee is still moving forward with
contempt proceedings against Houston-based power marketers Enron Corp. and
Reliant Energy for refusing to hand over documents to committee
investigators.  New York-based Morgan Stanley, now Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
& Co., got into the energy trading in 1984 and now is one of the top 20 U.S.
power marketers.  The company also has come under the scope of Rep. Peter
DeFazio, D-Ore. Morgan Stanley bought the rights to transmit just under a
third of the power flowing between California and Oregon from the Bonneville
Power Administration through February 2002.  DeFazio has written a letter to
the BPA, asking that the agency make sure the Northwest keeps its "reliable,
affordable" energy source.  "The ability of a financial services company,
which has no obligation to serve electricity consumers, to lock up all
available capacity for a year raises serious concerns," DeFazio wrote.  A
company spokeswoman said Morgan Stanley acquired the transmission capacity
from BPA to meet its power delivery obligations in the Northwest, and had no
intention of manipulating the market.








News briefs on the California power crisis


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 24, 2001  IRVINE ) Future Olympic swimmers in Southern
California may no longer have a training facility if the state's power crisis
continues.  Utility bills have jumped significantly over the past couple of
months and aquatic centers across Southern California have felt the pinch.
At Heritage Park in Irvine, home to gold medalist Amanda Beard and silver
medalist Aaron Peirsol, the monthly energy bill has doubled from $7,000 to
between $13,000 and $15,000.  Officials at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in
Pasadena have raised membership fees 10 percent to offset electricity costs
that have more than doubled.  The Industry Hills Aquatics Complex in Industry
may close its doors on Sept. 9, in part because of the rate increases.
Gas-powered heaters and electric motors run 24 hours a day at most swimming
centers to keep water temperatures warm. Some swim coaches said a temperature
drop in the pool can hamper an athlete's training regiment and possibly raise
health concerns.  Swimming facilities run on a tight budget, say coaches, and
the soaring energy costs have eaten away any profit margins the training
programs once had.  The Industry Hills facility has even used trash and
methane gas from the landfill it sits on to heat the pool. But the complex
lost about $85,000 last year and operators expect natural gas costs will
double this winter. The property management company, which owns the land, has
given a Sept. 9 deadline to reduce operating costs or close the swimming
center.  ))  CHINO ) The largest of 11 power plants that are supposed to be
built by Sept. 30 under the governor's emergency fast-track program appears
to be running behind schedule.  The concrete foundation hasn't been poured at
the $125-million natural gas facility, which sits near the California
Institution for Men in Chino. The plant, being built by Delta Power Co. of
New Jersey, would supply about 135,000 homes with electricity.
Environmentalists warn that the plant will produce smog five times more than
the legal limit and want state air quality officials, who will conduct a
hearing Tuesday, to deny a final operating permit to Delta Power.  Delta
officials said they hope to meet the Sept. 30 deadline despite the objections
by environmentalists and residents who live near the proposed plant. They
also pledged to install equipment by November that would reduce nitrogen
oxide compounds, which contribute to smog.  If Delta and other energy
companies finish their power plants by the end of September, they receive
incentives such as eliminating environmental analyses and the ability to emit
pollutants for months at levels exceeding state standards.







State sells surplus power at a loss


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 23, 2001  LOS ANGELES ) State officials sold excess
electricity at a loss of nearly $14 million in the first 16 days of July )
roughly 4.5 percent of the total amount the state spent on power during that
period.  According to the Department of Water Resources, the state purchased
3.5 million megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour. It
sold off 177,000 surplus megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per
megawatt-hour.  Industry officials told the Los Angeles Times it is routine
for utilities and electric companies to at times either sell power at a loss,
work out an exchange or give it away when they find themselves with surplus
power. However, some say this is an indication that the state government does
not belong in the power business.  The sales of surplus power "get to the
issue of, do these people really know what they're doing? Are they really
competent to be managing this to the lowest cost for the ratepayers?" said
Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. "It reinforces to me that we should get
the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."  Department of
Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details in response to
an inquiry by Campbell.  Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles, said he
did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.  "Right now the summer is
cool," said Wright, who is also chairman of the Assembly utilities committee.
"If this had been a normal July, we would have used all that power."
Department of Water Resources officials expect the sales to stop if
temperatures heat up later this week.  Department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo
said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the state's
electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a
megawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in
July.  Since January, the state has spent more than $8 billion buying
electricity for the customers of three financially ailing utilities ) Pacific
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and
Electric Co.  The state had to take over buying electricity to keep the
state's lights on after federal energy regulators ruled that only
creditworthy entities could buy electricity.







CHINO
Rush for Power Plant in Chino Raises Concerns
Energy: The facility may exceed pollution limits if it begins operations by
Sept. 30. Opponents say that would endanger public health.
By TERENCE MONMANEY
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

CHINO -- Seldom are government bureaucrats criticized for moving too quickly,
but so goes the battle here over a power plant slated for the sun-blasted
grounds of a men's prison.

The proposed plant--big enough to supply 135,000 homes--is one of five in
California that have been licensed to start up despite exceeding pollution
standards as part of Gov. Gray Davis' rush to bring more power online.

The program, covering small to mid-size facilities that run during hours of
peak demand, slashes licensing review from a year to three weeks, eliminates
comprehensive environmental analyses, and authorizes plants to emit
pollutants for months at levels exceeding state and federal air quality laws.
The catch is that the plants must operate by Sept. 30 or those rare and
lucrative incentives could be withdrawn--a possibility confronting developers
of the Chino plant, which a growing number of environmentalists opposes.

So far, with only 69 days left until the deadline, workers haven't poured a
drop of concrete foundation for the $125-million natural gas-burning
facility, developed by Delta Power Co. of New Jersey. The site is on the
outskirts of the California Institution for Men.

The proposed plant, the largest of 11 so-called peakers given expedited
approval, is galvanizing opposition to the governor's emergency fast-track
program. Environmentalists decry the fact that until the plant installs
devices to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds, which contribute to smog, the
level of the pollutant will reach five times the legal limit.

Five groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Planning
and Conservation League, have joined in petitioning state air quality
officials to deny the plant a final operating permit. They contend that
excess nitrogen oxides will endanger public health and that the fast-track
process jeopardizes decades of gains against smog.

"We're not necessarily opposed to a power plant on the site," said Gail
Ruderman Feuer, an attorney in the Los Angeles office of the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "We're just opposed to one without environmental
review and without all the pollution controls."

Critics also are wary of the fast-track process because the state has a
vested interest in making sure the plants are built quickly. The Davis
administration has promised to spend billions buying electricity from plants
that aren't built yet.

"It's a massive subterfuge," said Sandra Spelliscy, an attorney with the
Planning and Conservation League in Sacramento.

Jay Roland, manager of the Chino facility for Pegasus Power Partners, a
subsidiary of Delta, said the extra nitrogen oxides released from the plant
for a month or so are "not going to cause damage to anybody."

Roland said he is so frustrated by the "interveners," he sometimes wishes the
whole state would go dark, to underscore the power shortage that the plant is
intended to address.

Though opponents have made a tough job even tougher, he said he hoped to make
the end-of-summer deadline. Missing it could mean applying to the state all
over again under the old rules, he said. "Then I sit here nine months with
$120 million in equipment that's not generating any revenue."

State officials said it was necessary to approve the extra-polluting plants
because of the need to avoid blackouts and because there is a backlog of
emissions-control equipment. Besides, they said, state-of-the-art gas-burning
plants emit fewer pollutants without controls than do many older plants with
them.

Kevin Kennedy, a California Energy Commission official who reviewed the Chino
project, acknowledged that public involvement in the process has suffered
somewhat. "It's been difficult to get the word out . . . to make sure people
in the communities have enough information to know what's going on."

Site Seems Ideal for Power Plant

In many respects, the 11-acre Chino site looks right for a power plant. It
rests on flat surplus land at the northern boundary of the state's largest
prison property, where grasslands cover hundreds of acres.

Half a mile away is a booming warehouse district and a Southern California
Edison substation, which would relay the new power to the transmission grid.

Moreover, Pegasus runs a small power plant on the prison property across a
narrow utility road from the site. Supplying steam and a few megawatts to the
penal institution, the company sells the bulk of its 27 megawatt output to
Edison.

Delta's president, Dean Vanech, bristles at charges that his company doesn't
care about the environment.

He said equipment to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds won't be available until
around November, at which time engineers will work "as quickly as humanly
possible" to install it. Other air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and
microscopic dust particles, will be controlled from the beginning.

Also, though energy officials reviewed the proposal in a matter of weeks,
they closely scrutinized the company's nine-part application, which took two
months and $1 million to assemble, plant officials say.

The company moved the plant's site after biologists discovered two protected
bird species nesting nearby--burrowing owls and red-tailed hawks. That
required engineers to redesign gas, water and transmission lines and tinker
with the plant structure, Roland said.

Owlets in a nest by a proposed transmission tower still pose an obstacle. "We
have to wait for the babies to leave," construction manager Robert Surette
said.

Key decisions over the plant's future lie with the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, the air pollution agency, which said in May it would
give the Chino plant a construction permit.

But after environmental groups petitioned in late June, the agency asked
Pegasus for more data describing the possible impact of elevated levels of
nitrogen oxides on people in the plant's vicinity.

"We're still in the evaluation phase, and we're not going to prejudge this
project," said district executive director Barry Wallerstein.

He said the plant emissions were probably negligible compared with those from
the parade of diesel trucks in the nearby warehouse district. Those "could be
a larger health hazard to the community than this particular power plant," he
said.

Public Hearing to Be Held Today

The air quality agency has scheduled a public hearing today at its Diamond
Bar office to weigh issuing the plant a waiver needed to exceed state air
quality standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has indicated it
will not prosecute the Pegasus plant for temporarily emitting more nitrogen
oxides than the federal Clean Air Act permits.

Vanech of Delta said the company would want to build the plant even if it had
not received expedited approval: "The reason we're doing the project is that
we have a favorable long-term view of the California energy market.'

Delta operates 13 power plants nationwide, five of them in California on
state-controlled property.

The Chino plant promises to benefit this diverse, mostly blue-collar city of
66,000. Although the developer is leasing the property from the state, Delta
agreed to pay the city $500,000 up front, plus $75,000 annually and millions
more over the years in water and natural gas fees.

Vanech said the half-million-dollar "host fee" was compensation to City Hall
for its swift handling of the project's mountainous paperwork and for the
wear and tear that construction crews will cause on city roads.

In the neighborhood closest to the plant, where large new houses rest on
half-acre lots fronted by bridle paths, residents seemed divided.

Jim Tippings, 59, who is retired, said he didn't have a problem with the
plant running a month or so without full nitrogen oxide controls: "I don't
think a month is going to hurt us." Rising utility bills are what really
hurt, he said.

Up the street, 35-year-old Kent Hobbenslefken was not aware that a power
plant was going up a mile away. A former hazardous waste manager who sells
health insurance, he was skeptical of the need to run the generators without
full pollution controls, just to meet a bureaucratic deadline.

"What's a couple of months delay?" he said. "We're already in the crisis.
What's it going to do for John Q. Public? Are our rates going to go down? I
don't think so."

Surplus Power Sold at a Loss
Electricity: Cool summer and effective conservation efforts result in excess
supplies. Industry officials say it's a routine move.
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Caught with an excess of electricity as a result of cool
weather and heavy conservation, the state government sold power at a loss
approaching $14 million in the first 16 days of July.

The loss amounts to roughly 3.5% of the total amount the state spent on power
during that period.

To keep power flowing to 27 million Californians, the state purchased 3.5
million megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour,
according to the state Department of Water Resources. It sold off 177,000
surplus megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per megawatt-hour.
Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details
in response to an inquiry by Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine).

The sales of surplus power "get to the issue of, do these people really know
what they're doing? Are they really competent to be managing this to the
lowest cost for the ratepayers?" Campbell said. "It reinforces to me that we
should get the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."

Industry officials, however, say it is routine for utilities and electricity
companies to at times find themselves with more electricity than their
customers need. They either sell the power at a loss, work out an exchange of
power or give it away.

"It's not all that uncommon for utilities to be buying one day and selling
the next," said one Pacific Northwest trader who asked not to be identified
because his company does not permit him to talk to reporters. He said a rule
of thumb in the industry is to match supply to demand within 1% to 2%,
although "5% on a load like California isn't that much."

Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly
utilities committee, said he did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.

"Right now the summer is cool," he said. "If this had been a normal July, we
would have used all that power."

"The worm could have turned the other way."

Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said the state's crew
of 15 power purchasers found themselves selling a "very minimal" amount of
electricity in May. In June, more power was sold, but less than was sold in
July, he said. The department has not released those figures.

Department officials expect the sales to stop if temperatures heat up later
this week.

The water department was thrust into the role of buying 30% to 50% of the
state's overall electricity in January after the state's major utilities
became so financially crippled by high wholesale electricity prices that
energy companies refused to sell to them.

The department has so far spent roughly $8 billion of taxpayer money
purchasing power that is sent to the customers of Pacific Gas & Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.

Hidalgo said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the
state's electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a
megawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in
July.

"If we were out scrambling for power right now," Hidalgo said, "the market
would reflect that and adjust to it, and we would most likely be paying much
more in overall purchases."

Campbell said he assumes the department sold its most expensive, marginal
megawatts of power. But Hidalgo said that is not necessarily so. The
department does not track what it paid for the power it sells, he said.

The department's statement to Campbell shows sales to 25 different companies,
including the federal Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, and several private energy companies that
bought power plants from California's utilities under the state's 1996
deregulation scheme. Those firms include Dynegy Corp., Reliant Energy, Mirant
Corp. and Duke Energy.

Pacific Gas Gets 4-Month Extension on Filing Plan
Bloomberg News

July 24 2001

PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, won a
four-month extension to file a Chapter 11 recovery plan free from
interference from creditors and other groups.

The utility's sole right to file a plan was extended from Aug. 6 to Dec. 6.
Creditors, shareholders and others with a stake in the case could have
presented their own plans had the extension not been granted.

Companies reorganizing under Chapter 11 have the sole right to advance a
recovery plan in the first 120 days after filing for bankruptcy. Courts
routinely extend this period in large and complex cases. A committee
representing unsecured creditors in court papers said it "firmly believes
that all parties in interest should move quickly and provide assurance that
any filed plan will pay creditors in full and remedy PG&E's various issues
and problems."

PG&E Corp. shares fell 75 cents to close at to $14.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

State sells surplus electricity at a loss
BUY HIGH, SELL LOW: $14 million deficit
Paul Feist, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers

<http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/24/MN217124.DTL>
California has lost $14 million during the past three weeks selling surplus
electricity back to power generators as mild temperatures and energy
conservation slackened demand statewide.
The state, which has spent more than $8 billion purchasing power on behalf of
financially troubled utilities, became an electricity seller this month,
racking up losses and triggering criticism from Republican lawmakers and
consumer groups.
State Department of Water Resources Director Thomas M. Hannigan said in a
letter that since July 1, the state had sold 177,571 megawatt hours at a rate
of $36.95 each. California paid just over $118 a megawatt hour for the
electricity, Hannigan said in the letter to Assemblyman John Campbell, R-
Irvine.
Some of the exports to 25 buyers went to out-of-state power providers such as
Atlanta-based Mirant and Texas-based Reliant Energy, which a state Senate
committee has found in contempt for not complying with subpoenas for
documents as part of its investigation into alleged price manipulation.
Excess electricity also went to public power agencies such as the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power and even abroad to Powerex, the trading arm of
BC Hydro. The giant Canadian power firm has started issuing rebates to its
customers, citing "strong exports" to California and elsewhere earlier this
year.
"To me this reinforces the idea that the state should get out of the power
buying business as soon as practically possible," Campbell said.
TAXPAYERS GET STUCK
When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. or Southern California Edison makes a similar
mistake, he said, shareholders pay for it. But when the Department of Water
Resources is to blame, taxpayers are left holding the bag.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis defended the losses, calling them minuscule
in the bigger context of the state's power-purchasing strategy.
"This is all an inexact science," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "This
has been a handful of days over seven months, and the amount is minuscule. If
the choice is keeping the lights on or having rolling blackouts, it's a small
risk to take."
Because power can't be stored, all power trading operations are occasionally
forced to sell excess electricity, Maviglio said. He said that people would
have laughed in January had the administration predicted that the state would
have more than enough power this summer.
Mild weather and a strong conservation effort by Californians have led to
days when the state hasn't needed all the power it has on hand.
SHARP DROP IN DEMAND
In recent days, the peak load on California's grid has been around 33,000
megawatts -- far below the 40,000-plus megawatt demand that can come on a hot
summer day.
"When we bought power at these prices, who would have thought that it was
going to be the coolest July in 20 years?" said Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los
Angeles. "The problem becomes when you second-guess things."
The state Department of Water Resources has negotiated about $43 billion
worth of electricity contracts spanning 15 to 20 years. The contracts were
made public after media organizations, including The Chronicle, and GOP
lawmakers sued the Davis administration.
Consumer groups yesterday criticized the losses, calling them an inevitable
byproduct of the state's entry into the power-buying business.
"It's one of the costs of secrecy. You've got an agency that is totally
unaccountable to the public," said Doug Heller, a consumer advocate with the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "They haven't done a great job
of serving the public's needs for energy procurement."
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said Campbell and other critics
were not being fair to the Davis administration.
"You can't say at one time get the energy situation under control, but then
question every line item a month out," she said.

San Diego tries to undo the damage
THE PLAN: Regional public power
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:dlazarus@sfchronicle.com>
Tuesday, July 24, 2001
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle </chronicle/info/copyright>

San Diego -- This city, which was first to bear the brunt of the state's
energy crisis a year ago as electricity bills tripled, is now aiming to be
first with a long- term solution: regional public power.
A bill is making its way through the Legislature -- and being fought at every
turn by the power industry -- to make San Diego County one of the largest
municipal utility districts in the nation.
If the measure fails, San Diego officials intend to refashion the local water
authority as an alternative utility hub that would construct efficient new
plants and steal business away from costlier, decades-old facilities owned by
out-of-state generators.
Some consumer advocates believe that San Diego's efforts could serve as a
model for large-scale public power systems in Northern California.
"If we can pull this off, we can bring down prices and show the way to energy
independence," said Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego. "If we don't change the
rules, we're going to be back where we were."
It won't be easy, though. Even if San Diego can overcome vigorous opposition
from power companies, its public-power scheme still could run afoul of Gov.
Gray Davis, who is counting on statewide revenue to finance next month's
municipal bond offering, the largest in U.S. history. Going its own way as a
municipal utility district would mean San Diego could avoid purchasing
electricity from the state Department of Water Resources, thus reducing the
flow of cash into California's coffers.
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said Davis would not take a
position on San Diego's public-power bill until it cleared the Legislature.
"But the governor would obviously look extremely carefully at anything that
would affect revenue to pay off the bonds," he said.
Twelve months after California's energy crisis first erupted in San Diego,
leading to statewide blackouts and financial catastrophe for utilities,
residents of this city, to a large extent, have tried to put last summer's
difficulties behind them.
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., owned by Sempra Energy, had been the first of
California's three investor-owned utilities to pay off outstanding debts and
thus qualify for a lifting of the rate freeze that accompanied deregulation
of the state's power market.
Unfortunately for San Diegans, wholesale electricity prices suddenly
skyrocketed, and San Diego Gas & Electric was free to pass along its rising
costs directly to consumers.
Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison were
still protected by the rate freeze and thus saw no changes in their power
bills -- although the two utilities, in turn, were forced to absorb about $14
billion in unrecovered expenses.
San Diego power rates subsequently were limited by state regulators to
restore stability to the local market -- but not before many residential and
business customers saw their monthly bills go through the roof.
"I'm still paying almost double what I was paying before," said George
Aguilar, owner of a downtown jewelry store. "We should talk to lawyers and
sue the people in the government responsible for this. It was pure
negligence."
WELL-INFORMED POLITICIANS
In fact, San Diego's political leaders are now among the best informed in the
nation about energy issues and the volatility of electricity markets.
When power bills spiked last year, outraged consumers demanded that their
representatives take steps to remedy the situation. Democrats and Republicans
alike took a crash course in the frequently arcane minutiae of the energy
business.
"We didn't create this problem. We didn't make any mistakes," said San Diego
Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who has been among the most aggressive local
politicians in responding to the energy mess and is a leading proponent of
the county's public-power plan.
"But one way or another, we're going to have to pay for it," she said. "This
was a very bad experiment."
Her solution is to establish a vast municipal utility that essentially would
take over the entire service area of San Diego Gas & Electric, which provides
power to 1.2 million customers.
PLANS FOR NEW POWER PLANTS
The county-run utility would build its own power plants and renewable- energy
resources and would transmit electricity to customers over existing San Diego
Gas & Electric lines. Funding for the municipal utility's activities is not
yet clear.
"There's no question in my mind that we can generate power for less than what
the generators are putting on the market," Jacob said.
REGIONAL APPROACH PRAISED
Medea Benjamin, a San Francisco consumer advocate, said the regional approach
sought by San Diego -- which requires a rewriting of state law -- would
benefit consumers by making construction of new plants more economically
feasible.
Municipal utility districts statewide are now limited to individual cities.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is one of the few large enough
to generate its own juice and sell off excess capacity.
San Francisco voters will be asked in November whether to replace the
existing San Francisco Public Utilities Commission with an independent power
and water authority.
"It would be wonderful if San Diego's disastrous experience with deregulation
results in them taking a leadership role in creation of regional public
power," Benjamin said.
Not everyone, however, backs the plan. San Diego Gas & Electric's parent,
Sempra, has actively lobbied against the public-power bill in Sacramento,
fearing that it would allow seizure of the utility's distribution system by a
county energy authority.
"It's unclear what the bill is trying to accomplish," said Art Larson, a
Sempra spokesman. "California's energy crisis isn't a local-utility problem.
It's a demand-and-supply problem."
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP CRITICIZED
Another considerable opponent of the plan is Jessie Knight, head of the San
Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce and a former member of the state Public
Utilities Commission.
He believes that public officials are no match for savvy power-industry
executives in a competitive marketplace and that the county cannot guarantee
lower rates by building its own plants.
"This thing looks like the biggest shell game in the world," Knight said.
Moreover, he said, he could not see how San Diego would win legislative
backing for regional public power when state authorities, including the
governor, were counting on revenue from all customers to back California's
multibillion-dollar bond offering.
Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido (San Diego County), author of the
public-power bill, said it was too soon for anyone to speculate about San
Diego's breaking away from the rest of the state's power grid.
"We have to be realistic about the future of this," he said. "Right now,
SDG&E is the utility in San Diego County, and there is no intent to transform
that overnight."
Meanwhile, in case Wyland's bill is defeated, a separate legislative effort
is taking shape to expand the San Diego water authority's jurisdiction to
include electricity.

13 plans submitted to alleviate power transmission bottleneck

Washington -- More than a dozen private investors have turned in proposals to
ease a Central Valley bottleneck in California's electricity transmission
grid that can contribute to blackouts in Northern California, Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday.
The 13 investment plans were in response to the Bush administration's
national energy plan, which called for the expansion of Path 15, an 84-mile
stretch of interconnected transmission lines located between Los Banos
(Merced County) and Coalinga (Fresno County). The lines form the main link
for power flows between the northern and southern parts of the state.
"When we announced our plan in May to upgrade Path 15, it was dismissed as an
old idea on which little had ever been done," Abraham said in a statement.
"Today, I am pleased to announce that those days of neglect and inaction are
over."
The administration's plan calls for $230 million in new investment from local
utilities and other private entities. Abraham called it "the first concrete
step to relieve congestion on the state's power grid."
The Bush administration, he said, "is taking a leadership role in addressing
a long-neglected problem in Caifornia's electricity transmission system."
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. owns Path 15. During the late 1980s, the utility
held public hearings in the Central Valley to discuss a possible expansion,
but dropped the plans after concluding that existing transmission lines could
handle future demand.
When California's electricity shortages began to mount last year, Path 15
proved to be a major bottleneck. By preventing an increased flow of power
from the southern to the northern parts of the state, it contributed to
blackouts in Northern California. Earlier this year, the state PUC ordered an
upgrade to the transmission system.
The federal Western Area Power Administration, which manages hydropower
projects in the Central Valley, is conducting studies for the Path 15
expansion and will be holding environmental impact hearings in Coalinga on
Aug.
27 and in Los Banos on Aug. 28. More information is available on the agency's
Web site at www.WAPA.gov <http://www.WAPA.gov>.
The agency will review the proposals and make a recommendation to Abraham.
The proposals were made by, among others, PG&E Corp., Calpine Corp. and
Mirant Corp, the Western Area Power Administration said.
The expansion plans calls for a third transmission line and other upgrades
that would permit an additional 1,500 megawatts of transmission capacity,
enough to power 1.5 million homes. Construction time is estimated at three to
four years and would cost $300 million.
The companies are expected to recapture their investment by adding a
surcharge on power transmitted over the new lines, Abraham said.
The expansion is likely to follow the same route identified in the hearings a
decade ago, running in a 2,000-foot-wide corridor through the foothills west
of Interstate 5, mainly over privately owned ranchland.
In a related development, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., hailed an agreement
between the House and Senate to spend $1.3 million for the new environmental
impact report and feasibility studies to expand Path 15. The money will go to
the Western Area Power Administration.

1037EDT0155.DTL>
(07-24) 07:37 PDT (AP) --
Developments in California's energy crisis:
TUESDAY:
* No power alerts Tuesday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
MONDAY:
* U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveils a plan to help alleviate a
transmission bottleneck that has kept power from flowing freely throughout
the state during times of peak usage. The plan calls for expanding the
state's power grid along so-called Path 15 by attracting private investment
for the $300 million project.
* A Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation has given the
full Senate a report asking for Houston-based Enron Corp. to be cited for
contempt. The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of
the Wholesale Energy Market says Enron failed to comply with a subpoena for
financial and trading documents. The Senate recessed Sunday until Aug. 20 and
could take up the matter when it returns.
* Secretary of State Bill Jones asks the state Assembly to allot $250,000 for
a legislative review into whether Gov. Gray Davis' advisers complied with
conflicts of interest laws. Jones, a Republican who plans to challenge Davis
in the next election, says the advisers failed to disclose that they held
stock in energy companies. The Senate rejected a proposal Saturday to earmark
that money for a bipartisan investigation. Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman,
says the governor's office, the attorney general and the Fair Political
Practices Commission are "working together to resolve any conflicts of
interest and to deal appropriately with any violations."
* U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali gives Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
four additional months to produce a reorganization plan in its Chapter 11
filing. PG&E lawyers had argued for the extension because of the complexity
of the case. The bankruptcy case is believed to be the largest ever.
* The Department of Water Resources says that since July 1, the state has
sold 177,571 megawatt hours at $36.95 each. During the same time, DWR
purchased 3.5 million megawatt hours of electricity at $118 per megawatt
hour. That amounts to a loss of about $14 million. Assemblyman John Campbell,
R-Irvine, says it's proof the state needs to get out of the power business.
DWR spokesman Oscar Hildalgo says it's normal for utilities to sell excess
power they have purchased.
* Shares of Edison International close at $13.67, down 57 cents. PG&E Corp.
stock close at $14.25, down 75 cents. Shares of Sempra Energy, the parent
company of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., close at $25.20, down $1.09.
* No power alerts Monday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
WHAT'S NEXT:
* The deadline for the Legislature to approve Davis' rescue deal for Southern
California Edison is Aug. 15.
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's
electricity crisis.
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost
nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E,
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state
lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and
natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are
refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power
for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The
state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas
& Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and
PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs.
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's
multibillion-dollar power buys.








Figures show state lost big on extra power
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK

Mercury News


State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month
selling surplus electricity for less than it cost.
The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a
loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much
excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts --
and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be
needed.

Well, Well, Well,
I am writing this note to all the smack talking coonass LSU fans who enjoy
banging on The University of Texas Longhorns with smug smack like
"Overrated, Overrated".
I usually use the BCC field when sending smack notes like this so everybody
won't get barraged with weak Reply All's from recipients who think they can
go toe to toe with me in e-mail smack (i.e. Val and his weak shit he likes
to send).
This time is different because I think y'all should know who your fellow
pathetic smack talking LSU fans are.
Y'all can start a new support group - called "Vassigh's College Football
Smacked down Bitches - that got their cakeholes shut by Chris Simms, Cedric
Benson, and Roy Williams et al"
Y'all have dished it all out, so I do not feel bad for rubbing salt into
the fatal wound that Ole Miss delivered you and your team Saturday night.

Here a couple of smack statements made by some if not all of the cajun's
included in this e-mail header.
"Simms sucks, how could he be a preseason heisman candidate?" - Over his
last three games, Simms is 59-of-88 (67.0 percent) for 698 yards and 12
touchdowns passing 2 touchdowns rushing with just one interception
(176.41 rating).  He has just started about ONE full seasons worth of
games recently and is coming into his own.  Simms will be a top NFL pick
as will Roy Williams and Cedric Benson.  I can't think of any College
Football team in history with the high caliber triple threat that UT has
with Simms, Benson, and Williams.
"The SEC is the best conference in football, the Big XII Sucks" - What a
joke that statement is.
"LSU would whip UT"  - Yeah right - LSU Could not beat Rice.
"UT is the most overrated team in college football" - interesting since
they are higher ranked now in November than they were in the preseason
polls.
"Mack Brown can only recruit - he can't coach worth a damn - Nick Saban
is better" - Mack Brown has one loss - he hasn't lost in Austin since he
has been coach - while Saban has led LSU to three losses - 2 in the Red
Stick - just THIS SEASON.

Every college football analyst would agree no conference compares to the
Big XII.
The BIG XII have 3 TEAMS RANKED IN THE TOP 5 early November - unbelievable!
Two of the top ranked BIG XII team's only losses were to the other top
ranked BIG XII school.  UT loss to OU and OU loss to Nebraska.
The only way the best teams in the Big XII lose is when they have to play
against each other.
The highest ranked SEC team (Florida) lost to Auburn which lost to pathetic
Arkansas.

All football players worth a damn have left y'alls God Forsaken state.
Peyton to Tennessee, Marshall Faulk to SDSU, the newest Manning to Ole Miss
that just whipped up on y'alls 3rd world state university in the Red Stick
on national television on a cool October Saturday night.
Cajuns like Jake Delhomme and Bobby Bouchieaux stay in Lousyanna to play
college ball though - that's some encouraging news for y'all.
I can't think of one LSU player that has ever done shit in the NFL.
NFL teams have gotten screwed every time they drafted a Lousyanna State
football player.
David Lafleur, Kevin Faulk, Harvey Williams, Eddie Kennison - the list goes
on and on.  It is really pathetic.
Texas has just RECENTLY produced dominating hausses like Ricky, Tony
Brackens, Dan Neil, Shaun Rogers, Leonard Davis, Priest Holmes, Blake
Brockermeyer, Bryant Westbrook, and many others.  Look at Eric Metcalf in
his first game back to the NFL for the Redskins - breaking NFL records.
Texas players are magic baby.
Not to mention legends like the Tyler Rose, Tom Landry, Bobby Layne, and
Tommy Nobis

I hope y'all enjoy Shreveport on a cold December night while y'all attend
Lousyanna States bowl game against Fresno State at the Independence bowl.
At least you can enjoy the New Years holiday by watching the NFL like
offense of The University of Texas Longhorns play in a BCS bowl and God
willing with some magic from TAMU over the Texas Traitor filled roster of
OU and some other help - watch UT vs. Miami in the Rose Bowl.

I guess that smack from Elliot saying Rohan was better than Simms seems
pretty foolish to you now doesn't it.
That dude needs to play linebacker if he wants to get in the NFL.  He might
have a decent arm but he has no clue in the pocket,  The difference between
how Eli Manning ran the passing game and Rohan did for LSU Saturday night
showed LSU's deficiency at the QB position.  Fumbling, bumbling, stumbling
is the best way to describe his play.

CKL - you better buy your family Christmas gifts from the dollar store
because you need to save your money to pay on the $500 bet you made with me
the night of Val's wedding in that little bar in Natchez, Mississippi.  You
boldly put your soon departed money where your mouth was all night, since
all you were ranting was "tiger bait, tiger bait" any time I was trying to
tell you how UT would whip up on LSU like the 3 lesser ranked teams have
already done this season.
The bet for $500 was to go to the person whose team would be ranked higher
at the end of the 2001 College Football season: Me = University of Texas
You =  LSU.
Well since UT is in the top 5 and with a worst case scenario would not
finish out of the top 15 this year and the fact that LSU will not even
finish the season ranked - you need to start saving your extra pocket cash
- or we can work out an installment plan.
Lenhart was a witness as well was another of Val's amigos (I forgot the
name but know the face).

It looks like history will keep on repeating itself with the Great State of
Texas always being superior in every facet over it's little cajun neighbor
to the east - Lousyanna.
Texas has the winningest NFL team of all time in the Dallas Cowboys, the 3
time champions and top 4 ranked Texas Longhorns.
Conversely Lousyanna has the losingest NFL team of all time in the Aints,
and the doormat of the pathetic SEC west Lousyanna State university.
The last Governor of Texas is the President of the United States and leader
of the free world.
The last Governor of Lousyanna is in prison licking Boudreaux's balls for
the next 15 years or so.
And the bottom line is that y'all are in my State working because there are
no jobs outside of casinos and bars in Lousyanna

Even the only bright spots in the pathetic history of y'alls only
professional sports franchise is provided by Texas players - Earl Campbell
and Ricky Williams.

He who laughs last laughs best.
Man this note is a classic.  I think I will be sending it to Jim Rome.

Hook 'Em

Val forward this note all over the Red Stick and all over that God Forsaken
land east of the Sabine.
The Truth shall set your people free.

Brian

ISDA PRESS REPORT - TUESDAY,  NOVEMBER 7, 2000

* Tax Change to Boost Danish Derivatives Market
* ISDA plans restructuring info session.
* ECB intervention fails to bolster euro
* Corporates Caught Napping As Deadline For FAS133 looms.
* Derivatives traders at JP Morgan are delighted...

Derivatives Week - November 6, 2000
Tax Change to Boost Danish Derivatives Market

A change in Danish tax law that is expected to be passed this month should
lead to a surge in derivatives use among pension funds and life insurance
companies.  Jens Kristensen, head of the financial division at the Danish
Ministry of Economic Affairs in Copenhagen, said the tax rates for all the
gains on investments for pension funds and life insurance companies are
being equalized, at 15%.  Previously, there were tax incentives to investing
in cash equities-gains on equity positions were taxed at 5%.  The flip side
of this was that non-equity investments, including, hedging, were taxed at a
much higher rate - 26% - and losses on cash investments were not offsettable
against gains on hedges.

Clause Stampe, chief investment officer at pension fund Laegernes
Pensionskasse in Copenhagen, said it plans to increase its use of
derivatives because of the taxation change.  It will use more derivatives to
hedge all of its non-euro and non-krone denominated fixed income portfolio
and its equity portfolio where it feels there is currency risk.  About 10%
of the funds DKK35 billion (USD4 billion) portfolio is in non-euro or
krone-denominated fixed income products.  The pension fund already
occasionally uses foreign exchange swaps and options to hedge equity
investments, but not fixed income products.  Stampe said he envisages its
use of derivatives to hedge equity would increase slightly, but said it was
too early to estimate by how much.

Pensionskassen for jusristernes og okonomernes, a pension fund, is going to
start using derivatives, according to Jesper Jakobsen, strategist and head
of asset allocation in Copenhagen.  He said it was too early to tell exactly
what strategies it will pursue but he envisages the fund will use
derivatives for hedging all asset classes because of the change in tax law.

Previously, there was a lower tax for equity to encourage Danish pension
funds and life insurance companies to invest in local equities.  With global
capital increasingly dominating the local equity market, local institutional
investors are no long required to maintain liquidity on the Danish stock
market.

Derivatives Week - November 6, 2000
ISDA plans restructuring info session.

The International Swaps ant Derivatives Association is holding a meeting in
the next two weeks to discuss  restructuring as a credit event. Credit
derivatives players recently were at loggerheads regarding whether
restructuring should be listed as a credit event under the standard terms of
single-name credit default swaps (DW, 10/9). A group of dealers in New York
elected last month to stop including restructuring as a credit event when
quoting prices for standard single-name credit default swaps. Restructuring
as a credit event will still be available as a menu choice on the ISDA
confirm, ant will not be removed from the 1999 ISDA definitions.

According to Bob Pickel, general counsel at ISDA in New York, dealers and
end users have had numerous
questions regarding the decision, and ISDA's credit derivatives
documentation task force is providing a forum for those questions to be
answered.

Some dealers reported a slowdown in the credit default swap market following
the decision. Others said that they saw no slowdown in their trading
activity, and noted that even if there was a slowdown, it cannot be linked
to the decision. Cash markets remain volatile, and there has been little in
the way of new bond issuance or loan activity recently, they added.

Pickel emphasized that the main point of the meetings is to allow
participants to provide information, rather than provide a forum for debate.
Because this is a market practice issue, it is not up to ISDA to rule how
parties should trade. Meetings will be held concurrently in New York and
London, with a brief conference call joining both of the meetings. The
meeting is open to all ISDA members.

Separately, ISDA is planning to complete its strategic documentation review
by year-end.

Financial Times - November 7, 2000
ECB intervention fails to bolster euro
By Christopher Swan and Adrienne Roberts

The European Central Bank intervened in foreign exchange markets yesterday
for the second consecutive trading day, emphasising its determination to
defend the currency. The unilateral move by the bank initially drove the
single currency almost a cent higher to $0.87. But the impact was
short-lived. The release of figures indicating that growth is slowing both
in the eurozone and in its biggest economy, Germany, pushed the euro back
below the level at which it had started the day. It finished in London at
$0.861, down from its close on Friday. In Birmingham, Romano Prodi,
president of the European Commission, expressed full confidence in Wim
Duisenberg, chairman of the European Central Bank, and insisted that the
euro would recover more ground.

Sales of distressed assets by Japanese banks and other financial
institutions to investors, such as US hedge funds, have unexpectedly slowed
in recent months, bankers and analysts say. The decline is likely to
raise new unease about the health of Japan's financial industry and its slow
progress in cleaning up the problems caused by the collapse of the country's
1980s bubble. Some industry observers suspect that one reason for the
slowdown is that falling Japanese share prices have eroded the banks'
capital - and left them unwilling to make additional provisions for losses.

If the slowdown persists, this could leave some foreign funds and banks
re-examining their attempts to build a distressed-debt business in Japan.
Precise data on the distressed-debt market is not available because it is
one of the most secretive sectors of Japan's financial markets.

Derivatives Week - November 6, 2000
Corporates Caught Napping As Deadline For FAS133 looms.

A raft of corporates have delayed implementing the Financial Accounting
Standards Board's Statement 133, and are scrambling to meet the deadline,
which for most companies is Jan. 1. "The big five have been warning people
for years not to delay in figuring out how to implement FAS 133, but a lot
of people didn't listen," said Rob Royall, partner in the national
accounting group at Ernst & Young in New York. Dilip Kumar, partner at
Arthur Andersen in New York, added that billion-dollar companies have been
laggards in implementing the measure, although he declined to name them.

"We were worried that would happen," said Bob Wilkins, senior project
manager in charge of FAS133 at the accounting standards board in Norwalk,
Conn. He noted that the standard was originally slated to come into effect
for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 1999. Corporations concerned about
digesting the bulky standard while also preparing for Y2K persuaded the FASB
to push the deadline back to fiscal years     beginning after June 15, 2000.
For most companies, that's Jan. 1. "Cynics here said that some companies
would just let the standard sit on their bookshelves for another year," he
added.

The standard itself is daunting, consisting of about 280 pages plus 260
pages of derivatives implementation group interpretations. Ernst & Young's
Royall said the whole document could balloon to 750 pages by a year from now
as hazy parts of the standard are cleared up.

Satish Rishi, v.p. and assistant treasurer at Dell Computer in Austin,
Texas, noted that his company has preparing for some time for the new
standard, and will be ready for it when the deadline arrives. But he noted
that companies that have not planned adequately are reaching a crunch point
now. ZD. U%

AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST.......

The Daily Telegraph - November 7, 2000
Derivatives traders at JP Morgan are delighted...

Derivatives traders at JP Morgan are delighted their bank has been taken
over by Chase Manhattan.  "Hopefully they will sort out the toilets on our
floor," one says.  "There are only four of them, and they never get
cleaned."

On October 2, I, Aaron Klem and our outside attorney, Jeanne Bennett, met with other ESPs, the utilities, and the Energy Division staff of the CPUC to hammer out an agreement on implementing the CPUC's order suspending direct access (DA) and handling continued submission of DASRs.

It was news to the utilities that ESPs have many contracts --  most several years old -- that allow for addition and subtraction of facilities throughout the contract term.  The utilities had thought that cutting off DASRs would be the best way to enforce the CPUC's order without having to review contracts (which they don't want to do). After much discussion and debate, the participants agreed to make a joint filing at the CPUC seeking quick action.

Most agreed on the following plan (with the CPUC staff to check on the appropriate procedural vehicle):
We will endeavor to reach agreement on a joint filing at the CPUC to modify Rule 22 (the rule that governs CPUC/ESP interactions) (a Petition to Modify was also discussed as a vehicle) - a small working group of attorneys has been set up to draft this.  The group includes Jeanne Bennett and Dian Grueneich, who represents UC/CSU.
The new Rule 22 will add a section that acknowledges the CPUC action and sets forth therein (or in an Appendix) a verification procedure.
Each ESP will submit a list of customers by this Friday, October 5, for ALL contracts -- existing and new -- to each utility. It will be diificult and perhaps impossible to add customers later, so be complete.
Each ESP will submit to each utility the account level information for each customer on the list by November 1. All customer accounts should be on this list including facilities that have not yet been switched to DA, but may be switched sometime in the future.  Also, to the extent customers have plans for new facilities, put them on the list -- even if we do not yet have account information. Anyone who has the right to add DA later needs to be on the list.
Any DASR submitted for an account on the November 1 list will be accepted by the utilities -- no matter when it is submitted.
Additional accounts not on the November 1 list can be added through a verification process, such as an affidavit submitted by the ESP or by both the ESP and the customer.  This process is being worked out by the attorney working group.
The CPUC will be asked to approve this approach quickly.

There is risk that the CPUC will NOT approve the approach and will cutoff DASRs on some date certain, in which case legal action would be required to allow for futher submission of DASRs. Steve Roskow of CPUC Energy Division said the CPUC has two factions -- one wants to cut off DA and the other wants it to continue.  He could not guarantee how the CPUC will respond to the joint approach.  He also mentioned that there are many lawyers at the CPUC looking at the retoactivity issue and the Commission's ability to affect existing contracts. Several participants, including Enron, UC/CSU and APSES, made strong statements about the legal problems the CPUC would face if they go down that road.

The utilities will be making a filing at the CPUC tomorrow that describes the steps they have taken to enforce the order.  PG&E and SDG&E will discuss the meeting and the joint plan -- PG&E may also say it will stick with some DASR cutoff date unless it hears otherwise from the CPUC.  SCE did not attend the meeting in person and at the end made clear that they had not agreed with the joint plan.  SCE is sticking with its original plan -- a customer and account list by September 24 and a DASR cutoff of October 20, no DASR accepted unless the name is on the customer list. The Energy Division staff is trying to move SCE off this position but I believe it comes from "on high."  We'll take our own run at it through a higher level at SCE. For now, we should continue to submit DASRs and follow the proposed joint plan and just keep records of our interactions with SCE (and the other utilities as well). If the situation does not improve in the next few days, we will reassess.

There is also the risk that the CPUC will not act on the joint approach quickly, leaving these issues in limbo and the utilities assuming "risk" that they have done the wrong thing and will be "punished." Not surprisingly, the utilities seem to favor a drop dead date for DASR submission, as a way to minimize this risk.  During the course of the meeting, the utilities mentioned a "compromise" of January 1, 2002 for a DASR cutff date.  They thought this would give the CPUC time to act on the joint plan, but allow them to minimize their risk in the event the CPUC decides that the utilities should have cutoff DASRs from the beginning.  This notion may appear in the filings to be made tomorrow.  I told them that any drop-dead date for DASR submission would be unacceptable to Enron. UC/CSU said the same.  A few ESPs seemed ready to accept the 1/1/02 cutoff but most do not.

Call with any questions.

response_text: Response DS-PN:002

Pacific Northwest Generating Cooperative (PNGC) objects to this Data Request
on the grounds that it (i) seeks information that is not relevant; (ii) seeks
information that is privileged; and (iii) seeks information that is unduly
burdensome to produce. Rules of Procedure Governing Rate Hearings, Section
1010.8(b). PNGC further objects to this Data Request on the grounds that it
is in improper form as it does not cite to specific testimony or indicate the
specific use to which the information sought will be put. Special Rules of
Practice, WP-02-01. Further, the Data Request PNGC received in hard copy of
March 12, 2001 covered communications from October 16, 2001 to the present,
of which there were none. PGNC hereby responds to the corrected Data
Requests received March 14, 2001 covering communications from October 16,
2000 to the present. Without waiving the foregoing objections, PNGC responds
as follows:

1.    On or about January 26, 2001, Joe Nadal, PNGC, called Barney Keep,
BPA, in the afternoon and spoke with Mr. Keep for about five minutes. Mr.
Nadal stated that PNGC had concerns relating to the practical feasibility of
implementation details of proposed versions of LB CRAC methodology, i.e.
ability to get transparent monthly price quotes. No specific details or
alternatives were discussed. Mr. Nadal stated PNGC's interest in having BPA
and utility traders/schedulers attend an upcoming work session to give their
input. To the best of PNGC's knowledge, no other parties participated in
this telephone conversation.

2.    On or about January 29, 2001, Joe Nadal, PNGC, called Ed Bleifus,
BPA, in the morning and spoke with Mr. Bleifus for about five minutes. Mr.
Nadal again stated that PNGC had concerns relating to the practical
feasibility of implementation details of proposed versions of LB CRAC
methodology, i.e. ability to get transparent monthly price quotes. Again, no
specific details or alternatives were discussed. Mr. Nadal reiterated PNGC's
interest in having BPA and utility traders/schedulers attend an upcoming
work session to give their input. To the best of PNGC's knowledge, no other
parties participated in this telephone conversation.

3.    On or about February 13, 2001, Erick Johnson, attorney for PNGC,
called Peter Burger, BPA OGC, at about 11:45 am, and spoke with Mr. Burger
for about three minutes. Mr. Johnson asked whether BPA would take the
position that the provisions of the "Partial Stipulation and Settlement
Agreement," WP-02-M-111, Exhibit A, Parties' Proposal, Section H, would
preclude PNGC from offering direct testimony the the first 990 aMW of DSI
service should be priced at market. Mr. Burger did not initially answer this
question. However, at about 1:40 pm on the same day, Mr. Burger called back
to say that BPA agreed that the Partial Stipulation did not preclude PNGC
from offering such testimony. This conversation lasted about two minutes.
To the best of Mr. Johnson's knowledge, no other persons participated in
these telephone calls.

4.    On or about February 23, 2001, Phill Sher, PNGC, had a conversation
with A. Perino, BPA, starting at about 11:30 am and lasting about one hour.
The topics discussed were not specifically related to the BPA WP-02 rate
case. The terms "cost recovery adjustment charge" or "CRAC" did not arise to
the best of Mr. Sher's recollection. Also, to the best of Mr. Sher's
recollection, the topics discussed were matters of general interest to
economists. The topics discussed included commodity prices and load
forecasting.

5.    On or about March 6, 2001, Doug Brawley, PNGC, left a voice mail
message for Bob Procter, BPA, starting at about 3:00 pm and lasting about two
minutes. Mr. Brawley pointed out that in GRSPs Section Q- Low Density
Discount, Sub Section 7- Application of LDD to Slice, in the third line from
the bottom in paragraph 3, the words "Financial Based (FB) and Safety Net
(SN) should be inserted between (TAC) and CRAC - in order to properly reflect
the intent of the Settlement Proposal. Mr. Procter did not respond to this
voice mail message.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Due to ISO system difficulties with setting up charge type
1120, the estimated allocation of the June Summer Reliability Agreement
(SRA) Invoice amounts did not appear on the 5/31/01 Preliminary Statement as
planned.  The difficulties have been corrected and the CT 1120 estimated
allocation will appear on the 5/31/01 Final Statement which will publish on
8/13/01,  instead based on final May load and export data.

Future SRA Allocations will remain as originally planned.


XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX


REVISED MARKET NOTICE from July 6, 2001 @ 11:16AM
Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge
Charge Type 1120 (Estimate) and
Charge Type 1121 (Actual)

ISO Market Participants:
SC Settlement Contacts:
The California Independent System Operator has contracted for peaking
generation through the Summer Reliability Agreements (SRA) to assist in
meeting reliability needs this summer.  On March 30th, 2001 the ISO
Governing Board directed Management to recover costs incurred under the
Summer Reliability Agreements as provided in the ISO Tariff Section
2.3.5.1.8.  (i.e.: "all costs incurred by the ISO ... shall be charged to
each Scheduling Coordinator pro rata based upon the same proportion as the
Scheduling Coordinator's metered hourly Demand (including exports) bears to
the total metered hourly Demand (including exports) served in that hour.")

The SRAs require the ISO to make the monthly fixed capacity payments in each
summer month (June through October) and then true-up the penalties and
offsets in the last month. Two facilities with SRAs reached Commercial
Operation by June 15th, 2001and therefore became eligible to extend their
SRA, day for day, into November 2001.

The ISO will allocate these charges in two phases based on two new Charge
Types, "Estimated Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT
1120)," and "Actual Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT
1121)".  To accomplish this, the ISO will allocate an estimated charge,
based on the previous month's metered Demand and exports (CT1120).   Then,
in the following month, the entire estimated charge (CT1120) will be
reversed and the Scheduling Coordinator will be charged the actual amount
based on actual metered Demand (including exports) (CT1121).  An example of
the allocation process is as follows:

1.	The ISO will allocate the SRA amounts to the Market by applying CT
1120 (Estimated Summer Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge) on the
Preliminary statement for the last day of the Trade Month preceding the
Trade Month for which payment is due. The estimated charges for SRA costs
(CT 1120) applicable to Trade Month June 2001 will be applied to the
Preliminary Statement for Trade Day May 31, 2001.  The ISO estimate will be
based on the Market Participant's metered hourly Demand and exports from the
prior month (in this example, the metered hourly Demand and exports for May,
2001). Charges for CT 1120 will also show up on the Final Statement for
Trade Date 5/31/01.

2.	The ISO will then recalculate the allocation of the SRA amounts
through Charge Type 1121 (Actual Summer Reliability Contract Capacity
Payment/Charge) based on the Market Participant's actual metered hourly
Demand and exports for the appropriate Trade Month.  Actual (CT 1121)
charges will appear on the Final Statement for the last day of each actual
billing month.  (In the foregoing example, the charges would appear on the
Final Statement for Trade Date 6/30/01.)  As CT 1121 appears on the Final
Statement, CT1120 will be reversed in its entirety (e.g., the 6/30/01 Final
Statement will include a reversal of the 5/31/01 estimate)  The reversal can
be identified by the Trade Date for the previous month and it will have the
opposite dollar value as the previous month.

3.	Additionally, at the end of each SRA Summer Period, the SRA amounts
are recalculated to include penalties and offsets.  The Actual Summer
Reliability Contract Capacity Payment/Charge (CT 1121) will be adjusted
after the owner of the facility with the SRA has received the final market
settlement for the Summer Period.

The first SRA charge (CT 1120, estimated charge) will be for the June 2001
SRA payment and will appear on the Preliminary Statement for Trade Date May
31, 2001.  This Preliminary Statement will publish on July 25, 2001.
Adjustments for June 2001 through CT 1121 (based on Actual metered hourly
Demand and exports in June) will appear on the Final Statement for Trade
Date 6/30/01, which will be published on September 12, 2001.

CT 1120 and CT 1121 will be manual charge types within the Manual Line Item
Records.  Thus, no structural changes will occur in the Specification for
Settlement Statement Files, Version 13.1 and you should not need to make any
changes in your own systems.  Finally, as this is a new process it will
remain under review and may be subject to refinement.

Should you have questions, please contact your ISO Client Relations Account
Manager.

After discussions with the management team, the HR group and our advisors on Wednesday, January 23, 2002, we agreed that Janet Dietrich and I would co-lead, with HR and our advisors, the completion of the proposed Key Employee Retention and Severance Program for Enron.

A lot of ground work has been completed, however, we need to bring it together into a complete, concise and workable plan that can be negotiated and agreed to over the next two weeks.  Timing is critical.   In order to work towards retaining the intellectual capital required to maximize the value of the assets of the estate, the internal plan needs to be substantially complete by the close of business, Monday, January 28, 2002.  From there, we will endeavor to complete final discussions with the Creditors Committee and their advisors during the weeks of January 28 and February 4, 2002.

We need your assistance between now and this Monday to complete the preparation work.

Specifically, Janet or I will schedule some time with you today, tomorrow, over the weekend or on Monday to review to following information for Debtor companies:

validation of the information that you have already provided to HR
obtain any additional information necessary to make sure that the HR file is complete and accurate
your business plan, by quarter, for the next several quarters
a clear illustration of the value that exists (as it is currently best understood), along with a plan to realize that value
a clear mapping of your personnel to the plan
projected role, by individual - discussion to include your view on near term activities (ex: data mining) versus longer term roles (ex: asset sales, etc)
projected completion time, by individual, by task - to realize the value
discussion, by individual, regarding the most appropriate type(s) of retention / severance to utilize for their intended role
services provided, by individual, to debtor and non-debtor companies - including IT system connections and ties, partial and complete headcount, etc.

For non-debtor companies, we need to discuss:

services provided, by groups and individuals in debtor companies, including level of reliance, ability to separate tasks, individual / group services, etc.
any other issues that you believe need to be discussed and considered in these discussions


Preliminarily, we have broken out the groups as follows:

Janet Dietrich (with Kalen Pieper and Shanna Funkhouser) will meet with the following:

Wholesale		Jim Fallon
EBS		Rich DiMichele
EGM		Gary Hickerson
EIM		Rodney Malcolm
EA		Don Miller
Ongoing Concern	Janet Dietrich
Operations		Bob Hall
IT			Piper / Dayao



Dan Leff  (with Robert Jones and Marla Barnard) will meet with the following:

Finance		Jeff McMahon
Treasury		Ray Bowen
A/P, Purchasing, Cash Management, Insurance, IR

HR, EPSC, etc,	Cindy Olson
Properties, EHS
EES		Dan Leff
Accounting		Rick Causey
Tax			Bob Hermann
Government Affairs	Rick Shapiro
RAC		Rick Buy
Legal		Jim Derrick
PR			Mark Palmer
ETS		Stan Horton
International Assets	Jim Hughes
E&P		Scott Josey
EEOS		Brian Stanley


By the close of business today, Robert Jones from HR will send to each of you a spreadsheet illustrating:  employee name, title, salary, supervisor, projected role, projected completion date for the role, application of type of retention to the role, comments, etc.  Please review and verify this information prior to our meeting.

If we have missed a group on these lists, please advise Janet or I immediately.


Thank you for your input and help.  Kay Chapman or Esmeralda Hinojosa will work with you to set up time to meet in the next couple of days.


Thanks - Janet & Dan

Group,
A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites.  We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow.  PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis.  My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission, but then attempted to remove it immediately (wrong hour, wrong mw value on the submission etc.) and were unable to, or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it.   Then nothing happens.  There are two things we need to do to prevent this.
One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time.  Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem.
Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf, or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system.
Hopefully, this will prevent the extra charges, or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges.
Thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses

Dear Students,

Izio is a Learning Management System that the Haas School is using in a
pilot study. Two LMS systems are currently being evaluated, Izio and
another one called Prometheus. Izio provides many useful tools to help you
with your courses throughout the semester. To learn more about Izio, see
http://support.convene.com/stud/index.htm

Also, be aware that the use of Izio is an "opt-in" choice for each faculty
person.  That is, each faculty person may choose whether or not to use
it.  Ask your instructor to find out if he/she is using Izio this semester.

For the Fall semester, Convene has released an enhanced version of our
learning management system called IZIO PRO.  You can access Izio Pro by
using the same URL as the previous version at http://haas.izio.convenve.com
By now most students should have received an email containing their login name
and password.

To avoid the duplicate accounts issue we encountered last semester, Convene
has created a method for creating accounts and posting student course
registration information from Haas and Berkeley Campus Systems of Records
(e.g., EDULink, SIS/TeleBears).
Self registration has been removed.  CHANGES TO STUDENT REGISTRATION DATA
will be obtained from the Systems of Record and POSTED TO IZIO ONCE PER WEEK
UNTIL THE ADD/DROP PERIOD ENDS.

Convene has also changed the naming convention for Izio Pro accounts.  The
naming convention goes as follows, first initial_last name1.  This is a
locked field and cannot be changed by Haas Computing Services.  The Izio
software does however allow for users to changed
their unique password.

As always Haas Computing Services is pleased to assist you with any support
issues if you contact the Help Desk at (510)642-0434,
mailto:helpdesk@haas.berkeley.edu, or http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu.


Thank You

I suggest we talk first. Call me on the following cell phone 713-962-1490. The difficulty I suspect is that people are understandably uncertain of the unknown, but in 10 days we will have everything nailed down. Additionally, people, it would appear, seem to be making certain assumptions about the estate which I believe are false. I can't see the estate continuing to sponsor green cards, or in maintaining the cash balance plan, at least in the form of the past, etc., etc., Bankruptcy isn't pleasant.
I would however, like to avoid selling NETCO at the estate's expense, as difficult as this may be.
The main points we need to communicate and build around would be;
Salary - Everyone we talked to has indicated a willingness to keep them at least at current levels
Job responsibility - This is entirely Jay and Jenny's call. If they see a person as necessary to do a different job, they need to explain that. Typically, people should be transferring in exactly the same position as the current have, that would be the whole point of why NETCO needs them. Clearly NETCO will be a subsidiary of a large bank and as such will not have quite the same prominence it enjoyed with Enron pre-bankruptcy. Unfortunately, that is lost forever.
Bonus - Plan two main counter parties have agreed is more generous than Enron's current arrangement, if we perform.
Retention - Two main counter parties have agreed in principle to a pool of cash to be paid to the 700 people in NETCO who didn't get anything in Nov. This would be paid as soon as practical after signing in exchange for a commitment for them to stay for 3 months or so otherwise they will have to repay it.
Benefits - These will differ depending on who buys us. However, it each case they have comparable benefits but they are obviously different. On the specific point of pension plan, they have plans that require some vesting period but again the 2 main counter parties have agreed that they will take Enron service into account (i.e. if they have 5 years with Enron and their plan requires 5 years service to vest they will vest immediately, but obviously will get just their first years contribution). Now is someone is 4 years in with Enron, I recognise this is not a great answer, but has to be contrasted with how long there is a position in the estate for them (i.e. is there a job for another 12 months). The last point concentrates too much on negative aspects of what may happen to estate, so I would prefer to avoid too much innuendo here.
VISA's - we have a plan to switch all H1b visa's within 24 hours. This is apparently straight forward and Neil and Tim Callahan and I have discussed logistics with one of the counter-parties in some detail. On L1's, these will take up to 3 weeks to switch to H1's. Of the 70 people identified who have VISA's only about 7 or 8 have L1's. Tindall and Foster tell us this will not pose a problem and again we have discussed this with the one of the counter-parties who have agreed our approach. These people should avoid traveling outside US in this 3 weeks, but according to Tindall and Foster will be legit.
Green Cards - No easy solution. Essentially these will have to start from scratch. The counter parties have not at this stage told us whether they will support new applications. However, bear in mind I do not believe the Enron estate will continue with green cards, although this has not been officially proclaimed.
Expat Terms - These will probably be honored by the new company, although each counter-party has indicated a desire to "normalise" the terms with those of their own company, over time.
Employment Agreements - We have identified 179 across NETCO. The estate plans to transfer these to the buyer, but it is clear that each prospective buyer does not readily accept this as a term of the deal. As such my working assumption is that the offer letters each NETCO ee receives circa Jan 12, will supercede all previous terms including employment agreements, that individuals may have had. Specifically, I expect that the new employer will not honor future equity, cash retention, target bonus or severance provisions that may be in people contracts. Clearly, there may be some negotiation here.
Now, we have other things like Title's, PRC, Promotion dates, Salary reviews, project bonuses, All employee stock option programs, etc., to figure out, but I think it unlikely that these will be unpleasant surprises, after all the new employer will be probably one of the 5 biggest investments banks in the world and we almost certainly benchmarked our processes on them over the last 10 years. There may even be an ability to transfer (after a while to a different part of their organisation, if they have an internal posting process).
As to process from here, we want to identify those who DON"T want to go and why. I want to avoid ANYONE receiving an "offer" to switch and NOT accepting it. As I mention above, many of the terms of the "offer" are unlikely to be a huge surprise, and if people have genuine concerns I want to switch them out now for someone who does want to go. We should have 100% acceptance, not because of bullying or ultimatum's but because we figure out early who had concerns, solving them or switching them out for someone else.
Jeanie/Amy/Michelle/Neil - looks like we need new updated talking points for all. Lets get them out Weds.

Greetings Technology For All Board Members:

Several of you have seen the announcement today that Enron received notice
from Dynegy, Inc. that it is terminating the merger aggreement between it
and Enron.  In addition, Standard and Poor's, Moody Investors Service and
Fitch, Inc. downgraded Enron's long-term debt to below investment grade.

Technology For All has been the recipient of significant support from Enron
as a national sponsor.  We are grateful for Enron's support and the support
of Ken Lay.  We acknowledge the enormous credibilty that support has given
us to expand our vision and mission.  We now have direct supportive
relationships with 200+ Community Technology Centers in 15 U.S. cities
including our local TFA affiliates in Houston, Denver and Cleveland, Ohio.
We estimate that 30,000-50,000 persons each week are positively impacted by
these program partnerships.

With the Enron announcements today in the press, I wanted to inform you of
my actions in response to these developments.

Enron's commitment to Technology For All was a commitment of three items
over three years: Cash, Connectivity on the Enron Network and in-kind
contributions of hardware and/or other services.
The commitment was to expire at the end of 2002. Therefore, 2/3 of the cash
commitment has been received by TFA. We have received some in-kind
contributions, but never finalized the provision of connectivity on the
Enron Network. To date, continuing connectivity has generously been provided
by FYI-Net, a privately owned company of which Scott Yeager and members of
his family are the largest stockholders.  Therefore, while significant to
TFA, the Enron developments will not shutdown our vital mission to bring
technology to underserved communities.  Our vision continues to be focused
on using technology as a tool with the disadvantaged and underserved to
bring about sustainable and meaningful change in their communities.

Over the past several weeks as Enron situation has unfolded, we have done
and are doing several things to preserve our core missional focus.

1)  In expectation of reduced revenue, we have been cutting expenses
significantly and will be announcing several layoffs in the next few days.
I have taken a voluntary 10% reduction in income and Douglas Caldwell has
taken a voluntary 5% reduction in income.

2)  With the assistance of a "Capacity Building" tool developed by McKinsey
& Co. for the Venture Philanthropy Partners Group out of Washington DC., we
are in the midst of strategic planning effort that will help us rewrite our
business plan.  This effort will help us focus on the capacity building
activities most vital to our core mission and develop a "go forward" plan.

3)  We are intensely developing other relationships with corporate and
foundation funders that are project specific and results oriented.   Almost
all of my time will be focused on fund raising activites.  We have several
potential relationships under development. The diversification of our donor
basis is criticial to the future of our mission. To set an example for
potential donors, in addition to the reduction in salary, my 2001 gifts to
TFA equal 1% of my annual income.

4)  I have named Douglas Caldwell to serve in an expanded position of
leadership as the Chief Operating Officer. As the COO, Douglas now has
responsibility and authority for the day-to-day operations of Technology For
All and also for Technology For All-Houston. This decision was made in
consultation with Jack Trotter, Scott Yeager and Jack Clark.   As some of
you already know, Douglas brings many skills to this new role. In addition
to his numerous contacts with potential funding sources, he is able to see
the big picture of our common vision while at the same time is also able to
drill down to the details required to accomplish it.  He is also a person
who manages resources well.  While this is always important, this is
especially important during this time of economic uncertainty.  We must be
good stewards of our available resources.

5.	It is my recomendation to the TFA Board that we establish advisory
boards in each TFA city and at the national level to help carry the TFA
banner and to raise the dollars necessary to support our core programs and
activies.  The TFA-Houston Board of Directors unanimously affirmed this
recomendation for Houston.  I solicit your support of this recomendation on
a national level and your suggestions of persons who may be potential
advisory board members.

6.	We are in the final stages of preparation for a larger three year
proposal for a Houston Workforce Development Initiative that will utilize
our SmartForce content in collaboration with over 100 of our community
program partners.  It is our intent to pitch this first to Houston's Brown
Foundation for a three year commitment. The support of our board will be
vital to the success of this proposal.  Mr. Valenti, I will be calling you
and others to assist with this.

Please call me if you have any questions regarding my plans.  I look forward
to your comments and reflections.

Regards,

Will

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Attention:  Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts
Payable

Third Notice - The ISO  faxed the initial monthly FERC Fee invoices to
Market Participants yesterday afternoon.

However, the invoices did not contain the ABA number associated with wire
transfers to the ISO FERC Fee bank account.

Therefore, please use the following Bank Account information, if paying the
invoiced FERC Fee on a monthly basis.

ISO FERC FEE Account Information:

ABA # - 12100358
ISO Account # 14897-03272

ISO Settlements & Finance

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The following notice outlines the FERC Fee description, process and payment
options for ISO Market Participants.

FERC Fee - Market Notice

Introduction

FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from the
Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35 to the
ISO Tariff, 94 FERC  61,266, the California ISO has developed a procedure
for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market Participants.  The
California ISO has also developed a way in which entities that wish to claim
exemptions from this fee can provide the ISO with the appropriate data and
request that they be exempted from charges.

Process

One business day before the Preliminary Invoice for a trade month is issued,
the California ISO will issue a monthly invoice and data sheet to each
market participant for FERC Fees. Contained within the Invoice and data
sheet will be the SCs load and export data for the month, total exemptions
for load and export, FERC Fee rate, total FERC fee charges, and total
balance outstanding.  A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and
can be used to verify metered load and export quantities.

Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis if an Approved
Credit rating is maintained, or financial security at a level sufficient to
cover the outstanding obligation is maintained as stated in Section 7.5.1.2
of the Tariff.  For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an
annual basis and meet the requirements to make annual payments, those
payments will be due 5 business days after the final invoice is issued after
FERC has issued the applicable FERC Fee rate in the following year.

Market participants that qualify to make annual payments must notify the ISO
Client Relations department if they will be paying on a monthly or annual
basis.  Please inform the Client Relations department of your decision
within one month of receiving your first invoice.  Any SC payments received
by the ISO will be held in an interest bearing account.  Interest earnings
will not be separately identified to the benefit of individual Scheduling
Coordinators.

A final invoice will be issued annually,  by fax, after the FERC announces
the final rate after April 30 of the following year.  This invoice will
contain the actual charge to the SC based on the FERC rate, finalized load
and export data, and will take into account any payments made during the
year.

To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data showing
that applicable load and export data was not associated with transmission
transactions over ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting exemption from the
FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative with the BAID,
location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export that are to be
exempted. The ISO will assess the request for exemptions and will reflect
any approved exemptions in the subsequent month's FERC Fee invoice. Any
disputes concerning requested exemptions should be raised in the ISO's
settlement dispute process. The ISO will annually inform the FERC of the
total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO Controlled Grid

Due to the fact that the FERC Fee invoices will be generated using
preliminary settlement's data, the load and export quantities may change
once the settlement's data is finalized.  Market Participants will see the
revised data for the prior month on the subsequent month's invoice and data
sheet.


Timeline

The ISO will issue  invoices for FERC Fees to Market Participants commencing
this afternoon.  The process and timeline described above will begin with
the April Preliminary Invoice.  The FERC Fee invoice for April 2001 will
contain invoices for January through April.

If you have any comments please contact your Client Representative.

business London. Even if there was some minor inaccuracy from this method it
would be better than what we have now. This would greatly improve the
efficiency (by 4 to 6 hours) in reporting to senior management. Can you guys
initiate this change or get me to the right person there. Thanks, Rick

Aneela, could you call the business folks on the other side re: the following
brokerage agreements to find out if they could give their lawyers some gentle
reminders about returning legal comments to us:

- Simmons

- JP Morgan - Electronic Trading Agreement

-  Frost Securities

There may be others but these  come to mind immediately.

Also, it would not hurt to have the business person at Robertson Stephens
contacted to indicated that the lawyers reached an agreement on the terms but
we are waiting for Alberto Delgadillo to send back a final version for
signature and to find out when this is going to be done.

Thanx.

I talked to Terry Bilke at the MISO today about the training sessions and they have room in the classes on the 30th and 31st. He informed me that they would have more classes coming in the future. They have requested each company to limit the number of people they send to two for each session. I would like to suggest we send two people this time and in future sessions (fall) we could send another group. That is if anyone can spare people this time of the year.
I ask Terry when the MISO will be operational and his reply was FERC order 2000 stated that RTO'S will be running by Dec.15, 2001 and that date is their target. One of the MISO's biggest problems seems to be staffing. In an agreement with the MAIN  region they must leave 30% of the jobs open to MAIN employees but no one wants to move. The two parties have been negotiating that agreement but I don't know if anything has come out of the talks.

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.
Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d
New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1
Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.
New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.
OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select
Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.
Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.
2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.
Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:
Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.
For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:
Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4
In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.
Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,
Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.
Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.
2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.
Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.
Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.
OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Last week, our sales team signed Conagra Foods, a Fortune 100 company, to a
beta license for the Risk Workbench.  Based in Omaha, ConAgra is North
America's largest foodservice supplier and the nation's second largest name
in retail foods (www.conagra.com).  In 2000, Conagra had revenues of over
$25 billion, making it 68th on the Fortune 1000 list.  Many of their
consumer brands are household names: Hunt's tomato products, Healthy Choice,
Louis Kemp, Libby's, Wesson, Country Pride, Blue Bonnet, Parkay, Reddi-wip,
Marie Callender's, Butterball, Chef Boyardee, Orville Redenbacher's, Peter
Pan, and Swiss Miss.
They currently have a large risk management and trading operation in Omaha
that hedges their exposure to energy and agricultural prices while engaging
in some speculative trading.  Kiodex will work directly with the principals
in this division as well as senior management as they adopt the Risk
Workbench for the purpose of conducting this mission critical function.
Conagra represents a tremendous opportunity for Kiodex to enroll a Fortune
100 company in becoming a high-profile reference account for us as we launch
on August 23rd.  Our focus, beginning on July 9th, will be on converting
this trophy client into a full paying customer (they are paying to
participate in the beta program) of the Risk Workbench.  I ask all of you to
help us realize this opportunity.
I would like to especially acknowledge Russ Chalom in our sales department
for his work on this account.  For the past 2 months, he has been
aggressively courting Conagra, performing demonstrations for senior
management, including the CEO.  His lucid delivery and cogent explanation of
the Risk Workbench value proposition created this opportunity for all of us.
Well done, Russ!
Regards,
Raj

paperloop.com
SAN FRANCISCO, July 27, 2001 (paperloop.com) - Various major market pulp producers have further increased their downtime plans -- scheduling an estimated 767,402 tonnes during the third quarter -- in a more aggressive attempt to bring inventories in line with expected demand.
Many of the supply curtailments are taking place during the summer as producers anticipate continued weak pricing.
The 767,402 tonnes producers are taking this quarter represent the most downtime producers have taken in the past fiscal year, and already has eclipsed the estimated 655,132 tonnes producers took in the second quarter. The total also dwarfed the 383,000 tonnes taken in the first quarter, when cold weather prevented some producers from shutting operations, and has surpassed the 512,000 tonnes taken in fourth-quarter 2000, when several producers combined maintenance and market-related shuts. Current downtime is primarily market related, say industry sources.
Tembec, Inc., which has about 426,000 tonnes of yearly northern bleached softwood kraft (NBSK) capacity, will lose about 20,119 tonnes from its NBSK mill in Skookumchuck, B.C., while its other NBSK mill, in Smooth Rock Falls, Ont., will trim about 16,926 tonnes based on c capacity of 191,000 tonnes/yr. Tembec's NBSK downtime alone will total 37,405 tonnes, representing more than a third of the 100,000 tonnes of 3Q downtime it has planned. The remaining 62,595 tonnes will come from its various bleached chemi-thermomechanical (BCTMP) mills and some specialty sulfite pulps.
A source at Parsons & Whittemore today said the Rye Brook, N.Y., firm would shutter its northern bleached hardwood kraft (NBHK) mill in Nackawick, N.B., from Aug. 20 to Sept. 8. The mill, which has capacity to produce 260,000 tonnes/yr, will curb about 14,060 tonnes from its supplies. All of the downtime is market-related, said the source.
Meanwhile, International Paper Co. said during a conference call last week that its third-quarter pulp curtailments would total about 80,000 tonnes, equaling the downtime it had taken in the second quarter. That downtime is in addition to huge cutbacks of a combined 147,000 tonnes per quarter it has taken since shutting down its integrated pulp mills in Mobile, Ala., and Camden, Ark.
Canfor Corp. last week said it would close its Northwood mill in Prince George, B.C., from July 27-Aug. 6 and lose about 19,000 tonnes of NBSK. A company source said the mill would again close in September, with its two pulp lines shut for about 10 days each, losing another 15,000 tonnes and bringing the company's third-quarter NBSK downtime to 34,000 tonnes, according to the source.
Valois Vision Marketing reported last week that UPM-Kymmene has taken about 12,000 tonnes of NBSK from supplies at its Miramichi, N.B., mill in July. Further third-quarter downtime plans at the firm were not available.
"Look at the prices, I'm surprised there isn't more downtime," said Managing Director Michel Valois, who expected that paper downtime would continue at a high rate. That could fuel additional market pulp downtime moving forward, he noted.

Dear Melissa, Rebecca, and Michael,

I'm sending you an attachment of a manual that I have in progress that I think may be a useful tool for Settlements in order to help the Settlement Coordinators in their research before they enter a dispute into DMS.

I believe that by following this outline, the coordinators can easily find information that will help to settle a dispute and I hope that we can eliminate 10% of the total number of disputes entered each month.

Please look over what I have put together and provide me with any feedback or additions that you might have.

I hope to have this document ready for implementation by next Friday 5-18-01.

Thanks for your help, guys.

Executive Summary

The likely outcome of the 16 May elections is a victory by the BC Liberal Party (currently holding polls at 70%), a pro-business, right-of-center party led by Gordon Campbell.
Major changes in British Columbia energy policy are likely under a Liberal government.
A low snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed by US power consumers could force BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts expire
BC Hydro's additional generation at Williston is likely undeliverable

Liberal Party Platform

Income tax cut that would make BC's income tax the lowest in Canada
Independent audit of the province's books amid allegations of NDP mismanagement and incompetence
Review of all Crown corporations (including BC Hydro) to enhance efficiency and management quality
Campbell has also said that he wants to scrap the Corporate Capital Tax, the Machinery Equipment Tax and the Corporate Income Tax.

Energy Agenda

According to sources, under the Liberal party's rule, significant changes in the BC government's energy policy could include a move toward the privatization of some BC Hydro assets, perhaps including its transmission assets, as well as increased government support for independent power producers and coal-fired production.  At the same time, a rate review and attempts to establish a broad electricity strategy for the province could lead to a lack of clarity about the province's overall energy strategy over the next few years.  Campbell reportedly is a proponent of deregulation and of expanding coal-fired production.  Campbell calls thermal coal, "an asset that we want to be able to move forward with and to encourage once again in BC."  A high-ranking NDP source believes that Campbell will take the province back along the path of natural resources extraction rather than promoting new technology.  The source expects this to lead to strong protests from environmentalists.  "These are confrontational moves, and people will be on the streets."

Campbell's most likely choice for energy minister is Richard Neufeldt, though we caution that this decision depends on the make-up of the legislature after the election.  Neufeldt is responsible for the Liberal Party's energy, mining and northern development portfolio.  Sources speculate that if right-wing Liberals are dissatisfied with the party's performance after the May election, Neufeldt could again defect to the Opposition.  However, this gives Campbell even greater incentive to name Neufeldt energy minister, a high-profile position.

Should the Liberals win the election, Gordon Campbell has indicated that he would return BC Hydro to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission.  The BC government has derived $5.5 billion in revenue from BC Hydro since 1991 (roughly 85 percent of its profit).  Critics say this has undermined the utility's ability to pay down approximately $7.5 billion in debt and invest in the future. This also has left Hydro without a rate stabilization fund, something that sources feel may be needed this year.  Campbell reportedly intends to address these issues, and one can expect this to lead to calls for change.

Electricity Export Policy

Currently the BC Utilities Commission is demanding more information about BC Hydro's out-of-province sales.  The Commission has warned that, given the low snow pack, the utility could be a net importer of power this year. Supporting this view, the Northwest Power Planning Council, representing BC Hydro's key trading partners in the US, has said that it would not be able to rely upon British Columbia or Alberta during peak consumption periods over the next few years, and that its customers face a 25 percent chance of not making it through the winter without power losses.  The combination of a low snow pack, a return to regulation by the BC Utilities Commission and public concern about outstanding debts owed to BC Hydro by US consumers may force BC Hydro to stop out-of-province power sales once existing contracts expire.

BC Hydro Privatization

A key campaign energy issue for the Liberal party is the privatization of BC Hydro.  Campbell has urged greater electricity competition, saying, "We need to ensure the transmission infrastructure is available to all, producers and consumers, on an equal and non-discriminatory basis." He stated that independent power producers have been discouraged at every turn. "I want to change that big time," he told the Canadian Institute of Energy.  Campbell also urged more natural gas development, including pipelines and co-generation plants.

Campbell backtracked on this stance last week after being challenged by NDP leader Ujjal Dosanjh.  Campbell stated on 25 April, "We have no intention of selling BC Hydro; we have no intentions of selling their transmission lines, no intention of selling their dams, we have no intention of selling their reservoirs."  Liberal Party spokesman Mike Morton also reiterated on 29 April that BC Hydro would not be for sale.  A high-level NDP source commented that Campbell has been extremely careful in his choice of words regarding BC Hydro, essentially saying that he would not privatize the dams, transmission lines or generating stations, but that he is in favor of opening the sector up to competition.

However, local sources believe that some parts of BC Hydro might be sold as part of an overall review of BC Crown Corporations to enhance efficiency.  Likely sale prospects include BC Hydro's distribution channels and its energy trading subsidiary, Powerex.  In addition, Gary Farrell-Collins, the Liberal finance spokesperson and possible second choice for energy minister (after Neufeldt), has stated that public ownership of BC Hydro's non-core businesses, such as Westech, its systems division, and customer billing, could come under review.

BC Hydro Williston Generation

Current reservoirs levels at BC Hydro's Williston hydro-generation facility are at 2,150ft, which allows BC Hydro to drop levels another 35 ft (170 Gwhs/ft) under their current permit.  The one drawback to this plan's additional generation involves the Mackenzie pulp mill that would have to cease operation if water levels were to fall below 2,140ft.  Sources close to the Minister of Mines & Energy - elect, Richard Neufeldt, indicate that levels at Williston probably will not be drawn down below Mackenzie's operational limits due to concern over political backlash.

The ERCOT Board met yesterday in Austin to discuss among other things the
implementation of the Texas Choice Pilot and the single control area under
the control of the ERCOT ISO.  Below are the primary items of interest.
1.   ERCOT proposed the following plan to implement the Pilot program and the
wholesale:
May 25, 2001
ERCOT begins to transfer security analysis to the ESCA system
Participants able to start viewing network conditions, preliminary load
forecasts, preliminary A/S market requirement analysis, and retail load
profiles
ERCOT begins to manage and publish participant information and process
customer service requests
June 1, 2001
ERCOT initiates switch processing from competitive retailers starting with
small volumes and to be completed by July 1, 2001 (this is only the switch
request, power does not "flow" from the REP until the billing cycle after
July 6, 2001).
ERCOT begins to process retail meter read information.
Participants begin to enter outages in ERCOT systems (this will be parallel
to current outage system entry).
ERCOT will begin to publish distribution and transmission loss factors to the
market.
June 8, 2001
ERCOT Begins to complete data aggregation functions and initiates UFE
calculations/analysis.
ERCOT's A/S market requirements and QSE obligation Calculations are ready for
sing control area operations
ERCOT begins to execute the production settlement algorithms.  The settlement
results are not binding.
ERCOT begins to transfer grid security decisions to the new systems
Data aggregation allows initial calculations of UFE to be made visible to the
market providing energy accounting information
July 6, 2001
Frequency Control.  ERCOT begins single control area operation and
controlling frequency.  The existing control area replaced with the single
control area run by ERCOT.
Wholesale Markets.  ERCOT administers the regulation, balancing energy, and
reserve markets.  ERCOT starts clearing prices as part of single control area
operations.  The wholesale competitive market, as defined by the protocols is
initiated with ERCOT settling A/S markets centrally.
ERCOT begins to execute financial transfer processes as a result of binding
settlement with participants
QSEs must have completed qualification activities
While the proposal satisfies many of the competing concerns of the
Stakeholders and the PUCT, there are a few outstanding issues that remain.
ERCOT will begin switching load transfer requests on June 1 2001, but actual
settlement and energy flow will not occur until after the wholesale market
opens on July 6, 2001.  Enron has submitted a proposal that would allow the
retail market to decouple from the wholesale market which would allow the
wholesale market time to remedy the system limitations and the retail market
could begin June 1, 2001.  Under the ERCOT timeline if the wholesale market
is not ready by July 6, 2001 and the switch requests have already begun, then
there is no method to serve a customer full requirements without the ability
of the REP to purchase balancing energy and other A/S other than purchasing
under current tariff.  I can provide a copy of the Enron proposal to those
who are interested.
Another concern is for reliability of the system.  Some parties question the
wisdom of opening the wholesale market in the middle of the summer peak,
rather than waiting until the summer peak has passed.
2. Credit Standards.  The Board also voted on language for the surety bonds.
There has been a debate as to whether ERCOT should allow security bonds in
light of what has happened in California and the surety bond that was
underwritten by AIG.  At this point, the PUCT order requires ERCOT to accept
a surety bond, however, ERCOT is trying to tighten the payment language.  The
language that the board approved will be forwarded when I get the correct
language.  The board approved the addition of BBB- credit to the credit limit
matrix.
3. New Power Company made an unsuccessful appeal for corporate membership.
New Power argued that they were technically not an affiliate of EPMI who
holds the Corporate Membership.  EES for example has associate member
status.    It was pointed out by ERCOT that EPMI listed New Power as a
corporate affiliate on their application for corporate membership.  Marianne
Carroll, represented New Power in the appeal, and stated that EPMI did not
ask her advice prior to listing New Power as affiliate.  An additional
rationale cited by New Power was that in the future Reliant Energy wants to
"spin off" their generation company and that when they do, they should be
allowed a Corporate membership as well.  I am concerned about the appearance
of the appeal by New Power, it looked like an attempt by Enron to sway the
process in "their" favor by getting additional votes on ERCOT issues.

We are looking into setting up an electronic approval process for reference
credits and counterparties. This would be based on a platform such as
Livelink. The idea is that when  traders and originators would need an
approval, they would enter the name (and a few other details) into an
electronic document which upon submission would be automatically despatched
to the relevant groups for approval, i.e., Credit and Legal. For a name to be
approved, both groups would need to give their approval.

For this process to work efficiently, we need to be sure that each request is
seen by at least one relevant person in each group. For the time being these
persons are:

Credit:
Bill Bradford
Debbie Brackett
Rod Nelson

Legal:
Mark Taylor

Could you please be kind and confirm that these names are relevant and add a
few more if necessary (which it is for Legal).

Many thanks

Tomas

OK.
Greg, my recommendation is that we send out a note from ENE OTC saying, "ENE OTC is going to let BU's use their judgment on the PRC and evaluation process at this year end, given the rather extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in.. In that way if Stan wants to go ahead as below but EEL doesn't (which I believe is accurate) we can cater for what each team think is right for their people.
What do you think?

Attached is a summary of my notes at the Socal meeting regarding revised window procedures.  No hand-outs were provided.
Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d
New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1
Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.
New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.
OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select
Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.
Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.
2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.
Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:
Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.
For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:
Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4
In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.
Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,
Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.
Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.
2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.
Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.
Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.
OFO can be declared during undernom season (winter season)

Please find below the creditworthiness criteria for Alberta Pool.  I appreciate the help of Fino and Guillermo.
The credit worthiness in Alberta determines the trading limits for each participant in relation to its bond rating as follows:
Rating		trading limit
AAA		$25,000,000
AA		$20,000,000
A		$15,000,000
BBB		$10,000,000
<BBB		$0
Trading limit is a defined term and means the maximum financial obligation to which a participant is or is expected to be owing the pool administrator.   I am currently investigating of the current levels of our trading levels as that will determine the action required.
If a participant's financial obligations are expected to exceed the trading limit , the participant must provide a payment in advance or other form of financial security.  This security may be in the form of a bank guarantee, letter of guarantee, irrevocable letter of credit, or cash deposits drawn on a Canadian Chartered Bank, trust company, credit union or other lending institution acceptable to Council in or for an amount determined by the pool administrator to be equal to the expected financial obligations in excess of the trading limit.
It is noteworthy that a rating with a plus or minus sign indicates the relative standing within the major rating categories (so A- is A).  An exception to this is a rating of BBB minus which falls in the <BBB category and therefore no unsecured credit is granted.  It is also noteworthy that participants are required to report any downgrading of the relevant corporate credit rating within 2 business days.
The Power Pool of Alberta requires participants to report any event of default for borrowed funds or a material adverse change in their financial position within 2 business days of said default or change.

Thanks very much.  I'm assuming that Bev is there in her capacity as lobbyist for Wild Goose on this one?
Can you please let me know 1) the outcome of the meeting and 2) any actions the group intends to take.  I'm here in Sacramento, have alerted Hedy, told her that we're trying to gather more intelligence, and that you and your client are attempting to get folks together to mount opposition.  Give me a call on my cell phone to fill me in on what the group decides.
Finally, what information do you have about where generators and other large customers groups (i.e., CMTA, the Chamber and CLECA) are on the bill?
Best,
Jeff
MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com> 07/17/2001 12:38 PM 	   To: "'Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com'" <Jeff.Dasovich@enron.com>, James.D.Steffes@enron.com  cc: Harry.Kingerski@enron.com, Paul.Kaufman@enron.com, Susan.J.Mara@enron.com, Leslie.Lawner@enron.com, MDay <MDay@GMSSR.com>  Subject: RE: AB 23XX Bad Bill Alert
Jeff;
In response to your questions, I cannot explain why everyone missed this
bill in the past, I have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in
the last two months.  However, now that it is moving they have got the
message.  Williams (Kern River) is going to host a meeting today to create a
coalition to oppose the bill.  Bev Hansen knows where the meeting will take
place.  In addition to Williams, I understand that Questar, WSPA, and other
retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill.  My
client Wild Goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry
that much clout or name recognition so far.  I am hopeful that other groups
will surface soon.
As for the bill itself, the problem is two fold.  First, the CPUC decides
what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities.  They take
input from customers, but Loretta is a command and control type all the way,
and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate
pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated
state-regulated system.  While the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar
interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which
will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates.  The
large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with
exit fees.  If they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service
from the utilities.  Many if not all large customers, especially generators
cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only
interruptible access to the LDC system.  This is the same dilemma that the
RLS tariff caused.  My belief is that the obligation on the part of the
commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new
investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another
attempt to reinstitute the RLS tariff or an onerous peaking rate.  The
Commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not
undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to
economically take partial requirements service from an interstate.  My view
is based on Sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision
and statements by Lynch's office.  This could interfere with Enron gas sales
over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any Transwestern plans
for building across the border into California, although that does not
appear to be a high priority at this time.  This bill will also make it more
costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had
hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of
their needs.
Please call if you have further questions.  Mike Day

ID2:		Had to manually schedule Northwest CR 20786/24954, PNM CR 20785/25397, and TW CR 22948 because the receipt 		points were considered invalid.  The system EPSQ'd all the volumes down to 50%.  I didn't have any problems with the 		Northwest or PNM contracts, but I had to trace the TW admin contract all the way down the West Texas and Central 		pools.  I was able to reinstate a lot of the gas, but Astra's ended up at Socal and part of Richardson's gas ended up at 		Socal and PG&E.  Sempra's went to Calpine, Reliant went to Southwest Gas Mojave, and USGT's went to both Rio 			Puerco 	and Westar Ward so I fixed their volumes.

I had to manually fix Williams' CR 24925 and Texaco's CR 25923/25924 due to variances at El Paso Blanco and 			Mojave, respectively.  Williams was off by 1 MMBtu while Texaco netted to zero.  West of Thoreau scheduled to 			938,382 and San Juan at 772,209.  I confirmed the scheduled volumes with Gas Control for all the points involved.

EVE:		Had to manually schedule the Northwest and PNM Hub contracts again.  I did not touch the gas sales on the admin 			contract.  Hopefully it will schedule in the Non-Grid.  ANR is slightly off, and one Northwest Receipt changed by 1 on 		cycle 3.  The Northwest delivery from Milagro should schedule on the Non-Grid.  I submitted the volumes to WFS as if 		they did schedule on the Evening.

NON-GRID:	Confirmed down USGT's 27161 at Halley since NNG did not have a nomination in their system.  I got caught up trying 		to fix the Hub contracts that I did not notice the problem on the Evening cycle especially since Debra is working for 			the South end.  I nominated the payback volume on ANR's OBA for 15,000 on the 19th as well as the 20th through 			22nd.  I also confirmed the volumes for each day.  Check to make sure I am going in the right direction.  At least the 		system didn't get hung up during the confirmations like they did over the weekend.

If you need me on Tuesday, call me at home or page me.  I plan to work Wednesday night unless someone tells me otherwise.

Lorna,
Sources close to Kern River confirmed with me just yesterday that the
original expansion (124,500 MMBtu/d) is being contracted principally by one
party, PG&E National Energy Group, for their La Paloma Power Project outside
of Bakersfield, California.  I'm assuming that additional support for a 2nd
KRGT expansion will come from other developers interested in securing gas
supply.

It's important to remember the economics here --- Kern River's pipeline
originates in Wyoming (Rockies gas) and delivers directly into Southern
California.  Their gas generally clears the market at the Southern California
Border index.  Consequently, there is no stacking of rates as would be the
case if TW or EPNG attempted to deliver their gas through Mojave to the same
markets.  I've attached the recent press release regarding the La Paloma
project for your information...


PG&E CORPORATION UNIT BEGINS CONSTRUCTION OF
CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST +GREENFIELD, MERCHANT POWER PLANT
La Paloma Facility Will Fill a Critical Need for New Electricity Supplies in
California

San Francisco ) Welcoming the opportunity to provide competitive electricity
to meet the growing electricity needs of California, PG&E Corporation
(NYSE:PCG) announced today that its National Energy Group has begun
construction on the La Paloma Generating Plant. La Paloma is a 1,048-megawatt
, natural gas-fueled combined-cycle facility. The plant is expected to begin
operating in the summer of 2001.  PG&E National Energy Group President & CEO
Tom Boren said, "The construction of the La Paloma facility is an important
step in meeting the growing demand for electricity in the state. We welcome
the opportunity to further the growth of customer choice in California's
evolving competitive power market."

The California Independent System Operator (ISO), a non-profit public benefit
corporation responsible for maintaining transmission reliability and ensuring
adequate electricity supplies, hailed La Paloma as a welcome addition. "As
North America,s only regional transmission operator relying on competitive
market forces to maintain the critical balance between electricity supply and
demand for California,s 27 million electric customers, the California ISO is
very pleased that PG&E,s National Energy Group has stepped forward with the
La Paloma facility to fill an essential consumer need," said Cal ISO
President & CEO Terry Winter. "This investment shows that the market is
responding to the growing demand for electricity."
"As a highly efficient plant from both an energy and environmental
standpoint, California consumers will benefit," added PG&E Corp.'s Boren.
"The La Paloma Generating Plant provides highly competitive costs with a
minimum of energy consumption and environmental impacts."

The La Paloma plant site is approximately 40 miles west of Bakersfield,
Calif. in western Kern County on an industrial site previously used for oil
production. When completed, it will be the state,s largest facility designed
from the ground up exclusively as a merchant power plant. A merchant plant
sells its electrical output to wholesale customers in a regional competitive
bulk power market. Those wholesale customers, which include traditional
utilities, municipal utility districts, retail energy services companies,
wholesale power marketers, and electric cooperatives, in turn arrange to have
the electricity delivered to retail consumers.

The La Paloma development team has selected ABB ALSTOM POWER Inc. as the
turnkey contractor for the project. ABB ALSTOM POWER is responsible for the
design and engineering work, the procurement of equipment and management of
sub-contractors, and the actual construction of the facility. The La Paloma
Generating Project received its California Energy Commission approval in
October 1999, and the financing package for the project is being completed
now.

"The rigorous permitting process really laid the ground for an outstanding
construction program," said Roger Garratt, project development manager for
PG&E Corporation,s generating unit. "We look forward to making a major
contribution to the Kern County economy in a manner that is completely
compatible with the area's sensitive ecosystem." Garratt noted the project's
plan to permanently set aside conservation land as part of its environmental
mitigation program.

This morning, all 5 FERC commissioners testified before the Senate Energy
Committee on yesterday's order and on the pending Feinstein/Smith legislation
to impose cost-of-service rates on wholesale power.  Highlights and analysis
are as follows:

1. Sen. Feinstein, the chief sponsor of Senate price cap legislation, called
FERC's order "a giant step forward" and said she is "very grateful" for what
the commission did.  Senators Gordon Smith and Barbara Boxer agreed.  Sen.
Feinstein said that she and Sen. Smith would now recommend to Chairman
Bingaman that next week's mark up of their price control bill be postponed
"for the time being" pending how the order plays out in practice.  Chairman
Bingaman said he would follow their advice and cancel next week's mark up.
(Responding to a question, each of the five commissioners said that Congress
should NOT act to pass Smith/Feinstein, at least at this time -- this
included Comr. Massey, who has favored legislation in the absence of
"stronger" action by the commission.)

2. However, it is very important to point out that House Democrats in
California and elsewhere out West have not been as supportive of FERC's order
as have the Senators.  House Democrats are still expected to attempt to offer
a price control amendment to the supplemental appropriations bill when it
comes before the House later this week.  Of course, the reaction of the
Senate may undercut the House Democrats's argument, at least at this time.
Furthermore, should prices go up and the FERC order is seen as not working,
price control advocates, including Sens. Feinstein, Smith and Boxer, will no
doubt pick up where they left off.

3. It will be very interesting to see how Senator Lieberman and Gov. Davis
react to the FERC order at the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee hearing
tomorrow morning.  While this committee does NOT have legislative
jurisdiction over the Feinstein/Smith legislation, this hearing will be well
covered by the news media.  Sen. Lieberman is a cosponsor of the
Feinstein/Smith legislation.

4. In my view, the political and public pressure will now shift in large part
-- at least for the time being -- from the legislative price cap proposals to
the settlement conference process that the FERC order will set motion.  There
was a clear drum beat at the hearing from the western senators, particularly
Feinstein, Boxer and Cantwell (WA), for refunds either out of the settlement
conference or ordered by FERC.  In essence, they are pressing to have the
price mitigation formula in the new order applied to power sales that took
place prior to the issuance of the order.

5. Another sense of the poltiical flavor is that Sen. Schumer (D-NY), while
expressing his continued support for deregulatioin and competition, pressed
FERC general counsel Kevin Madden (by this point the commissioners left for
the RTO conference) about why the order applied only to the WSCC and did not
apply nationwide.  Madden at least tried to distinguish the New York and
California markets, but then said that Con Ed has filed pleadings with FERC
to extend price mitigation to New York and he could not say any more about
the matter.

6. Ranking Republican Frank Murkowski said he had received a letter today
from four western governors -- those from Arizona, North Dakota, Utah and
Wyoming -- saying that since FERC has acted, there is no need for Congress to
pursue price control legislation.

There were a series of questions and comments on details and technical
aspects of the orders.  I will do an e-mail on these items later today.
Please advise if you have any questions or comments.

IN THE MONEY: Enron - From Energy Trader To Spinmeister
By Carol S. Remond

A Dow Jones Newswires Column

(This column was originally published Wednesday.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With the value of its stock continuing to plummet, Enron Corp. (ENE) tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press release touting, among other things, increased liquidity.
The problem is that most of the so-called news was three days old, recycled from the company's latest quarterly filing.
And investors weren't fooled by the release. Although the stock of the embattled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the release, climbing to $5.35 a share from $4.60, it quickly gave up most of its gains. One hour after the release, Enron stock was back trading at $4.98 a share, down more than 28% on the day.
"They had to say something, but really didn't have any new news. It's quite incredible," said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron.
Amid mounting fears that Enron's credit woes could thwart its plan to merge with rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN), a merger that many see as the only way for Enron to avoid possible bankruptcy, Enron began its press release by announcing that "it has closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines..."
Great news, given the way Enron has been burning through cash. Except that investors who took time to read Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday already knew that "on November 19, 2001, Enron closed a $450 million new secured line of credit, which will mature in the fourth quarter of 2002." Readers of the company's 10-Q also knew that the $450 million credit was secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co.
Meanwhile, the real news everyone was waiting for, an announcement about whether a $690 million loan due next Tuesday had been extended, has yet to be finalized.
Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to mid-December would be formalized soon.
Separately, people familiar with the matter said J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the syndicated loan, which contains a clause that, unbeknownst to many, was triggered by Enron's ratings downgrade to "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's Corp. earlier this month. The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the $690 million note on November 27 if it didn't post collateral.
Those people said that the syndicated loan, which is built inside a structured vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors around the world, would likely be extended to the middle of 2002 when other bank loans to Enron come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured.
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, according to the people familiar with the terms.
Meanwhile, Dynegy also tried to rally, although somewhat halfheartedly, investors around its plan to acquire Enron's stock. Dynegy said it was encouraged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining $450 million credit facility and news of the extension of the $690 million loan. Under the terms of the acquisition, Enron holders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share.
Investors, however, remain more circumspect, unmoved by the whopping 104% risk premium currently attached to the merger. (That's how much investors buying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday.)
Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come, analysts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enron's liquidity, or lack thereof, going forward.
"We're having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion (from the banks), even with the $1.5 billion from Dynegy, will provide enough liquidity for Enron," one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said.
As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron, Chevron Texaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, already injected $1.5 billion into Enron. Another $1 billion is expected upon closing of the deal.

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and diverse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of the city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., economists and analysts said.
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and is in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third major employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent months. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attacks and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if finalized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.
"It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Continental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in the grand scope of the Houston economy," said Phil Scheps, director of Houston's finance and administration department.
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energy giant's market share has steadily eroded.
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of layoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs "will be spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's efforts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenue collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. "We're watching to see where things go now," she said.
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. "While Enron is certainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what the impact would be."
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdown since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nation.
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the Texas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the initial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the city to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent. That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 billion budget.
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small change in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very large, Scheps said.
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence has quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenue collections will be available in February when the city receives data for the December holiday season, Scheps said.

Meeting in Singapore to discuss Enron's arbitration proceedings against Indian state

11/23/2001

Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - A panel of arbitrators will meet in Singapore on Saturday to discuss legal action by Enron Corp. against the western Indian state of Maharashtra, an Enron official said.
The Houston-based company has a 65 percent stake in the Dabhol Power Project in western India, and is locked in a dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board over unpaid electricity charges.
The Singapore meeting is likely to be followed by arbitration in a London court, Dow Jones Newswires reported, quoting an unidentified Enron official on Friday.
The company suspended operation of the power plant in May and now plans to withdraw from India.
Enron has invested about dlrs 1 billion in equity of the 2,184 megawatt of power project, the largest ever foreign investment in India.
Enron sold electricity produced from naphtha to its sole customer, the government-owned power utility in Maharashtra, which found the costs too high.
The company also served notice to the federal government for not honoring a contract that required the government it to cover the Maharashtra state power utility's unpaid dues.
Earlier this year, Enron's chairman Kenneth Lay wrote to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee threatening to sue the government for up to dlrs 5 billion if it did not resolve the dispute.
Dabhol Power Co. initiated arbitration against the state government for not honoring guarantees on power bills due for December 2000 and January, this year.
The panel, which has been appointed by the Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra state government, includes an independent observer.

Enron SEC filing contained information Dynegy was unaware of - report

11/23/2001
AFX News
(c) 2001 by AFP-Extel News Ltd

NEW YORK (AFX) - Monday's SEC filing by Enron's Corp contained information that proposed buyer Dynegy Inc had not known about, the Wall Street Journal quoted a person familiar with the merger plans as saying.
Dynegy representatives plan to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence on Enron, the source said, without specifying what the new information was.
In the filing, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than 2 bln usd in loans by the end of the year.
Dynegy announced Wednesday that it is working to accelerate regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition in accordance with the previously announced agreement.
The Journal quoted analysts as saying Dynegy is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the deal.
It also cited Fitch director Ralph Pellecchia as saying that, without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible".

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (ENE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said.
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enron.
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was.
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy.
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price.
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share.

Enron casts pall on analysts: 'Everyone had a buy on the stock' all the way down

For thousands of people burned by Enron Corp.'s spectacular implosion, it must have been tough to feel thankful yesterday.
Over the past month, the Houston-based company has admitted its earnings reports going back four years are useless, written down billions in worthless investments, and fired its chief financial officer in a failed bid to shore up its plunging stock.
The slide in Enron's stock (ENE/NYSE) has already wiped out US$67-billion in shareholder wealth. Now it may lose its last lifeline, a US$7.93-billion takeover offer from Dynegy Inc.
Enron's fall is proving to be more than just a cautionary tale about sketchy accounting. The case is raising serious questions about the responsibility of analysts who strongly recommended a stock that many now admit they never really understood.
"The public isn't going to trust stock analysts for awhile," said Scott Preston, a San Francisco-based analyst with Research Capital Corp. who does not cover Enron. "Every analyst had a buy on the stock. And it's not like there was only one little issue there. It's a mess and big brokerages were coming out as it was on the way down saying put this thing in your Grandmother's [RRSP]."
But Wall Street's embarrassment pales next to the pain of shareholders, including Enron employees whose pensions were loaded with the stock.
"I have lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything," Roy Rinard, a long-time Enron staffer, said this week as he announced that employees have banded together for a class-action lawsuit against the company.
Several analysts have acknowledged that Enron's financial statements were routinely incomprehensible. But with brokerages vying for the millions of dollars in equity and bond underwriting business Enron provided every year, many analysts chose to focus on the company's growth, and failed to ask tough questions about its books.
Critics say the red flags were waving long ago.
The first clear sign of trouble came Aug. 14, when Jeffrey Skilling quit the CEO job he took over just seven months earlier, citing personal reasons. Former chief executive Kenneth Lay reclaimed the job. "Our business is strong and our growth prospects have never been better," Mr. Lay said at the time.
In fact, cracks were already appearing in the business. Enron's plan to start trading capacity on fibre optic networks was a costly failure, and the company was locked in a prolonged dispute with the Indian government over energy purchases in the region.
In October, Enron surprised investors by reporting its first quarterly loss in more than four years, due in large part to the writedown of US$1-billion in bad investments. Within a week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating Enron's finances.
The company soon admitted major accounting errors dating back to 1997. Its profits had been overstated by US$586-million, or 20%. The company revealed that some of the investments it had written off were limited partnerships headed by CFO Andrew Fastow -- a serious breach of good corporate governance. Mr. Fastow was fired, but it didn't stop Enron's descent.
The pain may be far from over.
Facing a year of regulatory hearings to approve the merger, and a rapidly devaluing asset in Enron, many fear Dynegy will walk away from the deal. If that happens, Enron may be doomed.
The stock closed Wednesday at US$5.01, down 93% this year. Dynegy closed at US$39.76, valuing the Enron offer at US$10.67 a share. The fact that Enron's stock is trading so far below the offer price is a sure sign that investors doubt it will proceed, at least not at the current offer price.
All this has left investors wondering how so many could have been so wrong, about so much. And how can so many continue to endorse the stock?
Of the 18 analysts that cover the stock, 10 still rate it a "buy." Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleisher removed Enron from his recommended list this week, but only after his firm was excluded from the banking syndicate arranging the Dynegy deal.
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, dropped Enron from "buy" to "sell" this week, citing its long history of spotty disclosure, and often evasive answers to questions. She acknowledged to clients that her downgrade is "too little, too late" for many.

Enron looking for US$1.5B boost to balance sheet: Expects cash from buyout firms, private equity investors

NEW YORK - Officials working to shore up Enron Corp.'s balance sheet said yesterday the struggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than US$1.5-billion as early as next week.
Enron is in talks about investments of US$250-million with JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup and is also hoping to raise at least US$1-billion from private equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish to invest in Enron, but the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be talking to the company before Dynegy Inc. made its US$9-billion rescue bid, is understood not to be talking to Enron any longer.
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt until after completion of the merger.
The move comes as reports from Goldman Sachs & Co. and Fitch, the credit rating agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-term viability.
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were inadequate to meet US$2.8-billion of debt obligations falling due before the end of the year. People close to Enron say that nearly US$1-billion of that debt has already been restructured.
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed Enron would struggle to meet US$9-billion of obligations, due before the end of next year.
People close to Enron insisted Dynegy remained committed to the merger and played down talk of renegotiation.
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the deal, they predicted.
But bankers acknowledged the fate of the Dynegy deal was largely irrelevant in terms of the company's immediate liquidity problems.
The company has raised about US$7-billion in cash, enough to cover its operating costs since a US$1.2-billion writedown of shareholder equity plunged it into crisis on Oct. 16.
However, the company's cash flow is being squeezed. The computer screens in front of energy traders at Enron's London headquarters still glow, even if they are doing much less business following the U.S. group's financial woes.
The Belgravia offices house Europe's biggest electricity trader, which accounts for about a fifth of all European power contracts, worth roughly (ps)70-billion ($158-billion) last year in British, Nordic and other European markets.
Fears over Enron's credit rating have prompted a sharp fall in its European electricity trading. Nonetheless, some companies that had previously withdrawn from buying and selling power with Enron have resumed trading with it in the short-term market.
Few want to risk trading further than a week or two ahead, however, given continuing doubts over the company's finances.

Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endangered their retirement funds. The lawsuit, filed in Houston under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, alleges that Enron encouraged the employees to invest more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit was filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker, Steve Lacey. Enron shares have plunged more than 90 per cent over the past several months after an accounting controversy that eventually caused it to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating more than $580-million (U.S.) of reported income.

Dynegy's Bid for Enron Appears Less Appealing --- Merger Deal Loses Luster as Shares Tumble --- Acquisition Target Faces Numerous Earnings Problems

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multi-billion-dollar deal.
The pressure is coming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas in the U.S. In the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion (1.1 billion euros) write-off of assets, restated downward the past several years of earnings and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The problems owe largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships run by some of its own executives now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In documents filed with the SEC on Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.
On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Enron shares were down 28% at $5.01 each, after having dropped some 23% on Tuesday. There was no trading Thursday. More than 115 million shares changed hands Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also fell, traders said.
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's shares, which were also among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy shares were at $39.76 each on Wednesday, down $1.94.
Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement" though it continued doing due diligence review on Enron. Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough.
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To consummate the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 of its shares for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price.
However, from a price point of view, the deal is looking ever less attractive to Dynegy.
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 a share, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price.
Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price.
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts is also turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron executives have predicted that the merger, which is supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said that because of Enron's financial problems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said a "likely scenario" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply lower to about 0.15 Dynegy shares for each Enron share.
Such a move wouldn't be without precedent. According to a person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of Enron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was above $80 a share.
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover the significant business that has been lost" in its energy trading operations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," wrote Mr. Fleischer.
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to significantly renegotiate the terms, Enron might be pushed into bankruptcy. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron request for bankruptcy protection from creditors "is highly possible," said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one notch above noninvestment grade, or "junk" status. But Fitch also said that Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls" in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contributing to liquidity pressures.
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which has a specialty in bankruptcy and corporate restructuring. One energy trader said Wednesday that some colleagues had even started a betting pool about the timing of a possible Enron bankruptcy filing. But he quickly added that he had no knowledge that the company has contemplated such a step.
Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spokeswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the merger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said that his company had alternatives to the Dynegy deal, but he has declined to identify them.

Enron Europe carries on trading.

The screens in front of energy traders at Enron's London headquarters are still glowing, even if they are doing much less business following the US group's financial woes.
The Belgravia offices house Europe's biggest electricity trader, which accounts for about a fifth of all European power contracts, worth roughly GBP70bn ($99bn) last year in UK, Nordic and other European markets.
Fears over Enron's credit rating have prompted a sharp fall in its European electricity trading. Nonetheless, some companies which had previously withdrawn from buying and selling power with Enron have resumed trading with it in the short-term market.
Few want to risk trading further than a week or two ahead, however, given continuing doubts over the company's finances. Whether Enron can survive depends on the commitment of Dynegy, the rival US energy group, to its $9bn rescue takeover announced two weeks ago.
John Sherriff, president and chief executive of Enron Europe, was anxious on Thursday to show that it was still "business as usual" for his energy traders.
He estimates they are transacting about 70 per cent of the number of contracts they would normally expect, but only about 40 per cent by volume. Rival traders believe volumes may have fallen much further.
Contracts ranging from a day ahead to many years hence are used as a hedge to protect generators and retailers from risks of sudden price changes.
As financial instruments they are traded many times over. As a result, the total value of the transactions is much higher than the cost of the actual electricity delivered. However, the transactions play an increasingly important role in oiling competitive electricity markets.
Rival European power companies and traders are anxious that Enron should not fail.
Brian Senior, director of trading and asset management at Innogy, the UK arm of the demerged National Power, said recent transactions had shown there was sufficient liquidity in European markets to cope if Enron disappeared.
Traders were more concerned that Enron might not be able to honour existing long-term contracts. "This could have a domino effect, putting pressure on other companies," said Mr Senior.
US power companies failed in similar circumstances after the Ohio-based Federal Energy defaulted on power contracts in 1998, he said.
Martin Stanley, president of European energy trading for TXU, another large US energy group, said: "We are watching the situation carefully and would want to do nothing to add to Enron's problems by making unhelpful comments about their current position."
Mr Sherriff said: "Counter-parties are generally being very supportive."
Innogy said it had resumed limited trading with the US group but was "watching the situation carefully". TXU said: "We are still trading with Enron in the short-term market but less than we were."
The Nordic market is one of the most active for power trading. US groups such as Enron, TXU and Dynegy have helped to expand the UK market, while Enron has a strong base in Germany.

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sued by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses because of Enron's plummeting stock price.
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misled participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks, the company "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, because of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has been costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% of the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, according to one of the suits.
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesday by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A spokeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 investment choices, one of which is company stock.
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information.
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. The suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to the 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an investment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the end of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harrison & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's decline. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril.
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In addition, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the SEC.
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's stock. "I feel like I have been betrayed," Mr. Rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers. "I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything."
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Generally, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary duties, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities.
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LLP, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Gotto Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ikon Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing Ms. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Representatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employees to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for diversification.
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day after Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.01 billion in the third quarter, Enron "locked down" the 401(k) plan's assets, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A "lock-down" occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't make changes in their investment choices).
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth said.
"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announcing some really bad news," Mr. Barth said. "Mr. Rinard's looking at having no retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in your 50s."

Enron says sorry as shares keep falling.

11/23/2001

Investors in Enron must be wondering when their luck will change. The company's shares were sent tumbling again this week after the company revealed that its credit crunch was worse than many investors thought. The news spurred talk that rival energy trader Dynegy may have to inject more cash under its plan to buy Enron - or could even walk away from the deal.
In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said it must pay down a $690 million note by Nov. 27 because of the recent downgrade of its credit rating. Unless Enron repays the note or posts a letter of credit, the unidentified creditor can start liquidating Enron assets. These include CEG Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron is already in the process of selling to pay down other debt.
At the market close on Tuesday, Enron shares stood at $6.99/share, about 39% below Dynegy's bid price of $11.60/share, and a fraction of the $90.75 peak reached in August 2000 when the company was in its asset-light pomp.
At least Enron is trying to say sorry - sort of. In a conference call with analysts and investors last week, chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay indicated regret for the series of bad investments in non-core businesses that has nearly bankrupted the big energy trading company. "In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in some non-core businesses," Lay acknowledged. "I could not have ever contemplated the events we as a company and you as a stakeholder have faced over the last several weeks. This has resulted in a complete loss of investor confidence."
And, via the Dynegy deal, a complete loss of Enron independence, although even that is not cut and dried. If Enron fails to settle the $690 million debt repayment next week, its credit rating would likely be reduced to sub-investment or "junk" status. And if that happened, it would qualify as a "material adverse change," allowing Dynegy to pull out of the merger if it wanted to. Analysts doubt things will get this bad, still giving the deal a 70-90% chance of going through.

From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen partner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Management case.
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Arthur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry?
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know more than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said this week.
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead.
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong. But they can add up.
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 million over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a related party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not clear if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing partner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the table was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules.
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior people at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looked the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says he acted properly.
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits.
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting.
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the public of that.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal.
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said.
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enron.
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was.
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy.
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price.
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share.
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of Enron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was above $80 a share.
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading operations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," Mr. Fleischer wrote.
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-law filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible," said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one notch above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. But Fitch also said it believed Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls" in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contributing to "liquidity pressures."
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spokeswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the merger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alternatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron said it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.

Options Report
Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms for Tax Losses
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal
C11

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain extremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price for option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston company sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled investors.
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet session Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate income. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a three-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dynegy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compared with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the "wash sale" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "substantially identical" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive "buy" candidates.
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the wash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money put, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor.
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by "doubling up": buying additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stock.

INDIA PRESS: Enron May Sell Dabhol Stake For $500 Mln

11/22/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) may be forced to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Co. for around $500 million, half of the asking price of $1 billion, reports the Business Standard, quoting the New York Times.
According to the report, Tata Power Co. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) - the Indian bidders for Enron's 65% stake in the 2,184 megawatt Dhabol plant - were reportedly willing to pay only half of the asking price. If the lenders and prospective buyers adopt a take it-or-leave it posture, Enron may have little choice but to accept their offer and take a huge loss, the newspaper said.
Dabhol, located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is India's largest single foreign investment at $2.9 billion.

Lawsuit claims Enron led workers astray, hurt retirement funds%)

11/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endangered their retirement funds.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Houston under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, asserts that Enron encouraged the employees to invest more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit was filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker, Steve Lacey.
Enron shares have plunged more than 90 percent over the past several months after the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controversy that eventually caused it to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating more than $580 million of reported income.
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle, said Enron touted the value of its stock and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into Enron stock.
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berman, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class-action case.
Berman wants to prove that the 401(k) plan executives failed

Howdy.  I wrote the following last month while I was in Northern Cyprus.
Hope you enjoy it.

*  *  *

Maras, The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- Attached to the rusting
chain-link fence I am approaching are several blood red signs, on which are
stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier
holding a rifle and a warning, in Turkish, that "Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir
[To Take Photographs Is Forbidden]".  The fence, no longer quite plumb in
the soft sand, seems to stumble across the beach, eventually ending at a
gently lapping Mediterranean. There a tangle of wires attached to the fence
extends a short way into the surf, making anyone's effort to outflank it
obviously intentional.  The Turkish soldiers patrolling the non-man's land
beyond, to the south, could thus treat such an intruder, I suppose, in
whatever way they might see fit.

In the other direction, the fence, before it has completely left the beach,
cuts sharply north, running in front of the hulks of four empty resort
hotels.  Above them in the deep blue of the pre-dusk sky hangs a crescent
moon, the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  One of the hotels still has the
remnants of an identifying sign, with just two of its six letter Greek name
remaining.  Another hotel, the smallest and no doubt at one time the
quaintest, has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors
leading out to tiny porches.  Some of the shutters have rusted off their
hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings, and now point out to
sea as if giving urgent warning.  Others hang limply, defeated, from a
single remaining hinge.
Most surprisingly, every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is
either missing or broken.  I am taken back by such thoroughness, given that
the most likely motivation was vindictiveness.  I struggle to find a loftier
one, wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration, such
as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to
squatters.  Maybe -- though I find this thought the most troubling -- it had
been done just for the fun of it.





The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and
uninhabited Maras, the Turkish Cypriot's name for the town Greek Cypriots
call Varosha.  The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish
army invaded Cyprus in 1974.  Before that invasion the small Turkish Cypriot
minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority, though in
the years since 1960, when Cyprus was given its independence by the English,
periodic outbreaks of inter-communal violence had led to increased
segregation and emigration.  The invasion, launched after a coup on the
island and another particularly vicious spat of violence, eventually put an
end to even this limited association -- as it did the worst of the violence.
The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most 40% of the
island, which was accompanied and followed by one of the last century's all
too familiar mass cross-migrations.  The northern "half" is now home to
nearly all of the island's Turkish Cypriots, close to 20% of the total
population.

The border between the north and south, known as the Atilla Line, is one of
the many UN patrolled "blue lines" in the world.  Maras actually falls
within Northern Cyprus, with the Attila Line further to the south.  It is
controlled now by the Turkish army.  At the time of the invasion the town
had been a thriving, up and coming resort town, run mostly by Greek
Cypriots.  Indeed, all over Cyprus, since its independence -- despite the
periodic, deadly violence -- tourism had been booming.  But here in Maras,
at least, the boom is no more.  The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who
once owned, ran or otherwise worked there, fled in panic before the
advancing Turkish army, reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishes
on tables and washing on lines, some forgetting to turn off lights that
burned on and on for years.

UN sponsored "proximity talks" between the North and the South  -- called
proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face --
started in New York on December 4th.  They are set to continue in Geneva
this January 31st.  The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot
owners, or more precisely their return to it, is no doubt high on this
meeting's (thus far secret) agenda, as it has been over the years at the
many similar, though always fruitless, negotiations.  This time around,
however, expectations are running higher than usual, primarily because of a
positive change in the dynamic between the two side's by far most important
sponsor states, Turkey and Greece.  Turkey, for example, has recently
acquired candidacy status within the European Union, which commits it to
resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece.  Greece, on
the other hand, has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the
international stage, the biggest of which was being caught last February
having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader -- and
terrorist in most people's minds -- Abdullah "Apo" Ocalan.  Coupled with the
significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance
Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters last
year, the two countries just may be willing to push their client states
toward a deal.





The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve of
the short beach I am walking.  Behind me, at this beach's other end, is
inhabited Maras' nicest hotel (oddly sporting an English name, the Palm
Beach Hotel).  If you looked in that direction, taking in only the fine
hotel, the attractive beach, the dark blue sea, you might think you were in
a tourist paradise.  But this is no paradise.  As I walk the last few feet
to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge, much longer than the one I
am on, sweeping south most of the way to the horizon.  There are more
hotels, which I knew from what I had read were also empty.  But my reading
has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all.  First, in the
distance, one, two, three empty hotels quickly come into view, then, more
slowly, dozens more.  At the fence, with the entire beach now visible, I
count more than thirty of them, and these just on the waterfront.

Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment
scattered about the sand.  I try to imagine the happy cries of the children
as their parents, more than twenty- five years before, pushed them round and
round in dizzying circles on the miniature merry-go-around, now rusted and
partially buried by drifted sand.  There is a long slide too, though
half-tumbled down, one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed
after so many years of weather and neglect.  My own memories of childhood
end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized no-man's land.  How
different life must seem to those whose memories do.  What sorts of dreams
are built on this type of innocence lost?

I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel, along the way wondering if
it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence.  On
its porch I chose a chair, since it has become cold, near a partly cracked
door through which comes a warm draft.  I order a cup of tea.  As the
evening grows darker, so does the abandoned town spread out before me.  The
crescent moon is now higher in the sky and, together with a strategically
placed star, provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire dismal
scene below.

At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door.  The bigger
of the two is gripping the arm of the other, directing him forward to the
porch's railing.

"Bak [look]!" he says in Turkish, gesturing out toward the sea with a broad
sweep of his free arm.  "Harika, degil mi [Wonderful, isn't it]?"

"Evet, cok guzel [Yes, very beautiful]", his friend agrees.

They stand gazing out over the sea, though after a brief moment I see the
smaller man's head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore.  The
bigger man glances at his friend, sees where he is looking, then looks
himself.  They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man
returns his attention to his friend, squeezes his arm.  His friend, as if
awakening from a trance, slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins, smiles up at
his companion.  After two identical, simultaneous shrugs, they chuckle
uneasily, shaking their heads as they do.

When they turn to return to the door, I holler out to them. "Baris mumkun mu
[Is peace possible]?"

They stop, look at me with frowns of curiosity.  "Nerelisiniz [Where are you
from]?"  It is the big one who had taken the lead.

"Amerikali"yim [I'm an American]."

His frown deepens, though now for a different reason.  "Belki dort, bes yil
sonra [Maybe four, five years from now], belki hic bir zaman yok [maybe
never]."

"Ama, ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak, bir yeni baris gurusmesi [But, what about
January 31st, the new peace negotiations] (?"

"Hah!" he exclaims, interrupting me. "Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var
[There are always new peace negotiations]!"

He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he
used to introduce, to his friend, the sea.

This sheet is as complete as possible, and I am worried about it due to the following circumstances;

1.  The Dispatch sheet that comes to Real time was 25 MW flat on Sunday and LLH on Monday more than all the preschedules that were tagged today.

2.  The Four Corners values on that dispatch sheet changed between 5:15 and 5:42, from 10 mw long to flat. I tried to resolve the four corners schedules with PSCO, who
told me they did not have a purchase from EPE in July.  I tried calling numerous people at their office and cell phone numbers and got forwarded to Enron each time. Lisa had a buy resale with PNM at four corners, but that booked out and did not seem to match the 10 long that I saw in the dispatch sheet.  I spoke with Pete, who assured me that the sale to PSCO was good for the summer.

3.  I still was unable to resolve the 25 mw difference between the tags and schedules that we knew, and what the dispatch sheet said we should have for preschedule.  No EPE representative was available to tell me what they were expecting for the schedules, and I was referred by a Dispatch person to call on Saturday and speak to Carlos when he came in at 4 pm.  I was very uncomfortable doing this, and so in my desperation called Roger at home, who after some discussion with Steve at his home confirmed that the extrat 25 flat Sunday and LLH Monday was a deal that is supposed to begin on July 3.  I trust his assesment, and have removed the extra schedule from the sheet.



Between all of the preschedulers today at Enron, we have spent over 6 hours dealing with the EPE schedules today.

The sheet is as complete as I possibly can find justification for.

I am down to the last few error messages on the EPGT Quick Response and also looking into the external pool for WH034 in Unify.  About 70% of the line items have been cleaned up.

I need the following information from you as soon as possible.

1.  The downstream contract number for Aquila Marketing and a "scheduled quantity report" for the Pooling contract WH034, this is the report you would obtain from the pipeline at the end of each cycle to determine cuts etc. or you can give me the user id and password
and I can go pull it myself.

The EPGT's IT group is trying to research the correct DUNS # for Aquila Dallas Marketing.  If this issue is not resolved, I am planning on setting up a meeting with EL Paso on November 26th at 1:30 at their offices and I would like for you to go with me. We will meet with their IT and Business Group for about an hour or so.
Your prompt attention to this will be greatly appreciated.

IMPORTANT NOTICE

Attention:  Scheduling Coordinator (SC) Settlements Contacts and/or Accounts
Payable;


CORRECTED ISO ABA NUMBER:    121000358

ISO Account # 14897-03272



Third Notice - The ISO  faxed the initial monthly FERC Fee invoices to
Market Participants yesterday afternoon.

However, the invoices did not contain the ABA number associated with wire
transfers to the ISO FERC Fee bank account.

Therefore, please use the following Bank Account information, if paying the
invoiced FERC Fee on a monthly basis.

ISO FERC FEE Account Information:

ABA # - 121000358
ISO Account # 14897-03272

ISO Settlements & Finance

XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

The following notice outlines the FERC Fee description, process and payment
options for ISO Market Participants.

FERC Fee - Market Notice

Introduction

FERC has authorized the ISO to collect FERC's annual charges from the
Scheduling Coordinators (SCs) that use the ISO grid starting January 1,
2001.  The annual fee is based on the product of the FERC fee and SCs'
metered demand (load and export MWhs).  The fee is currently estimated at
$0.021/MWh and is subject to change. Load associated with transactions that
do not use the ISO Controlled Grid will not be assessed the FERC fee.

In accordance with FERC's March 14, 2001 Order on Amendment No. 35 to the
ISO Tariff, 94 FERC  61,266, the California ISO has developed a procedure
for invoicing and collecting the FERC Fee from Market Participants.  The
California ISO has also developed a way in which entities that wish to claim
exemptions from this fee can provide the ISO with the appropriate data and
request that they be exempted from charges.

Process

One business day before the Preliminary Invoice for a trade month is issued,
the California ISO will issue a monthly invoice and data sheet to each
market participant for FERC Fees. Contained within the Invoice and data
sheet will be the SCs load and export data for the month, total exemptions
for load and export, FERC Fee rate, total FERC fee charges, and total
balance outstanding.  A daily GMC Details file is already issued to SCs and
can be used to verify metered load and export quantities.

Payment of the FERC Fee is not required on a monthly basis if an Approved
Credit rating is maintained, or financial security at a level sufficient to
cover the outstanding obligation is maintained as stated in Section 7.5.1.2
of the Tariff.  For those entities that elect to pay the FERC Fee on an
annual basis and meet the requirements to make annual payments, those
payments will be due 5 business days after the final invoice is issued after
FERC has issued the applicable FERC Fee rate in the following year.

Market participants that qualify to make annual payments must notify the ISO
Client Relations department if they will be paying on a monthly or annual
basis.  Please inform the Client Relations department of your decision
within one month of receiving your first invoice.  Any SC payments received
by the ISO will be held in an interest bearing account.  Interest earnings
will not be separately identified to the benefit of individual Scheduling
Coordinators.

A final invoice will be issued annually,  by fax, after the FERC announces
the final rate after April 30 of the following year.  This invoice will
contain the actual charge to the SC based on the FERC rate, finalized load
and export data, and will take into account any payments made during the
year.

To claim an exemption from the FERC Fee, an entity must provide data showing
that applicable load and export data was not associated with transmission
transactions over ISO controlled grid. SCs requesting exemption from the
FERC Fee need to provide their ISO Client Representative with the BAID,
location, interchange ID, and quantities of load and export that are to be
exempted. The ISO will assess the request for exemptions and will reflect
any approved exemptions in the subsequent month's FERC Fee invoice. Any
disputes concerning requested exemptions should be raised in the ISO's
settlement dispute process. The ISO will annually inform the FERC of the
total quantity of transmission transactions over the ISO Controlled Grid

Due to the fact that the FERC Fee invoices will be generated using
preliminary settlement's data, the load and export quantities may change
once the settlement's data is finalized.  Market Participants will see the
revised data for the prior month on the subsequent month's invoice and data
sheet.


Timeline

The ISO will issue  invoices for FERC Fees to Market Participants commencing
this afternoon.  The process and timeline described above will begin with
the April Preliminary Invoice.  The FERC Fee invoice for April 2001 will
contain invoices for January through April.

If you have any comments please contact your Client Representative.

I assume this meeting is strictly for Accenture and PWC to pitch their vision
to Enron on how they would help add value or help Enron execute mid/back
office and/or CommodityLogic in a commercial manner.  I don't want this
meeting related at all to Andy's efforts with Accenture related to
transaction feeds unless Andy thinks it is OK.

I have told Baldwin at Accenture that Mid/back office and CommodityLogic is
separate from what he is working on with Dave Samuals and Andy on Transaction
hubs and is separate from DealBench, etc.  If we are not careful, Accenture
will be working with four or five different points of contact at Net Works
and we will end up hurting ourselves.

I am counting on Salley, Rex, Andy and Tom ASAP to each understand what the
other is doing with Accenture and make sure there is no way Accenture can
work us to our disadvantage. I also think Accenture needs to earn our
business because others can do what they are offering.

Also, check with Rex Shelby on PWC.  We just had an uncomfortable experience
with PWC that everyone should understand.  I recommended an Accenture meeting
but if Tom wants PWC, he should understand what they did to Rex.

Remember, all of this is very confidential so let's be very careful
internally and no meetings without transaction specific NDAs.

Your thoughts?

I am out next week but will check voice mail daily at 36635.

Good luck.

On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel in
downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and
back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.  To complete a
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an
integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at
their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas.

I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this design
session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13th
in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called a
DesignShopv.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is composed of
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you
have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely
regard this session as different from any working session you have previously
experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven
to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in the

EOL users can run eports and see all the details of transactions.  As
currently structured this would mean that any EOL user, including ENA, would
be able to run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity.
Obviously this would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules.  At
their last meeting Dale and Shelley outlined three possible ways to address
this:

Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid
data.  I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically
difficult or expensive.
Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether.  Here the story
was that while this was not necessarily difficult, EOL could not make any
changes before version 2 was ready.  The impression was that this would be
possible after version 2.
Erect procedural firewalls.  Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could
inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents
them from running reports on GPG data.  This probably isn't a good long-run
solution, but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure.  This
approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered
into a confidentiality agreement with GPG.

Solutions 1 and 2 require extensive technical work and unfortunately we
cannot currently spare the technical resources required for it. We can go
with solution 3 at present with the understanding that in the absence of a
large volume of trades it might be the permanent solution. This is something
that legal on both sides would have to agree to. Steve will check with their
legal department to see if this is acceptable. Dale can you please check with
Mark Taylor.

Further the credit departments on both sides should meet and iron out the
credit issues. Steve is going to make sure the two credit departments talk to
each other.

Thanks.

Savita

EES was recently assessed $147,000 by the Pennsylvania PUC as a method of recovering their costs.  Enron's local PA attorney, Kevin Moody of Wolf, Block, Schorr and Solis-Cohen LLP, notified us that he has taken the lead for a group of natural gas suppliers to challenge the assessments and inquired if Enron wanted to be a part of the group.  The group includes IOGA (an association of oil & gas suppliers in PA), TXU, Hess, New Power, and 4 others.  Moody successfully got a postponement of the payments until Oct 16.  EES is included in the postponement at this time.  The options are to litigate the assessment (Moody feels we are on solid ground to prevail) or to negotiate a settlement with the PUC where we agree to some assessment to be determined.  Litigating the assessment could cost about $50K - $60K (in addition to the $25K to date) whereas settling would obviously be less expensive initially but would provide an assessment for each year going forward.  Moody id meeting with the PA PUC this Friday to determine what would be the best way to proceed (he is hoping to convince them that the statute is quite clear that they cannot make the assessment and that they withdraw it).  We will have a better grasp of the situation and clearer path for the direction we should pursue after that meeting.  I will keep you informed.

The Capacity Auction Agreement Working Group for ERCOT (CAAWG - ERCOT) will
be the forum to work on the implementation of the standard form agreement and
resolution of issues related to using capacity auction products in the
ancillary services markets of ERCOT. The CAAWG - ERCOT will hold its meetings
at the Commission where a member of the Commission's Market Oversight
Division will be present.  This group will be filing its final work product
in Central Records at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001, for public comment prior
to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001 Open Meeting.

The SPP Stakeholders will be filing a standard form agreement and resolution
of issues related to the use of capacity auction products in the SPP
ancillary services markets at the Commission at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001
for public comment prior to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001
Open Meeting. Because the structure of the SPP ancillary services market is
still under development, the focus will be on ERCOT and input and assistance
from SPP staff will be sought in the coming weeks.

The Working Groups are a direct result of the PUCT Capacity Auction Order.
The current time line proposes meeting weekly as Stakeholders to work to
resolve the issues, schedules and final products to be included in the
auction this fall.  Under the current proposal the Capacity Auction Products
will be Baseline, Gas Intermediate, Gas Cyclic and Gas Peaking.  Each of the
PGCs must auction 15% of the Texas Jurisdictional Installed Generation
Capacity.  The capacity will be sold as a "slice of the system" of each of
the divesting PGCs and will not be for any specific unit.  During the months
of March, April May, October, and November of each year the available
entitlements may be reduced proportionately to the average planned plant
outage.  With respect to the firmness of the products, the PUCT found that
the products should be 100% financially firm to provide potential buyers of
the entitlements certainty in the products that they are buying.  Forced
outages are limited to 2.0% of the hours of the entitlement.

The Power Generation Companies (PGCs)  have recommended using the EEI Master
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement and Schedule CA will describe the products
available for auction.  A copy of Schedule CA will be attached below for your
review and comment.  Please note that the Schedule CA is not a final document
and is an initial proposal from the PGCs.  Your review and comments will be
essential.  Also, if you have any questions or comments as to the process of
the CAAWG or the auction process in general please feel free to call me.  The
working group will meet each Wednesday for the balance of April after which
the working group will meet May 1st and May 2nd in anticipation of the
proposed May 4th filing date.  After the filing, Enron will have the
opportunity to file written comments with the PUCT.  The Auction process
under the rule must be completed prior to September 1, 2001 for the initial
auction period.

The following is an initial list of issues.

1. What is the timing of schedules for each of the products from the buyer of
the entitlement to the seller of the entitlement.
2. Are ancillary services available from the Baseload product?  TXU has
stated that they cannot provide A/S from their Baseload units.  As   such,
should A/S be removed from all Baseload product offerings from all PGCs so
that there is a standard product or should the Baseload   offerings include
ancillary services when and where available.  The argument distills to if the
entitlement is more valuable in the market as a   standardized product or a
differentiated product that may or may not include A/S.
3. What is the delivery point for the entitlement and other operational
issues?  Should it be a single bus, multiple busses or congestion zones.
Congestion zones may change each year, under the current auction schedule,
you would bid for the product before you know the final congestion  zone.
4. How (or if possible) can responsibility transfers be used for balancing
energy?
5. Who will receive OOM payments?
6. What about compensation for other A/S payments?
7. Does released capacity exist, should it exist at all?  If so, what happens
when the capacity is released.  The PGC would like the offering to look like
a call option.  If the option is not exercised by scheduling, then the
capacity is deemed released.  This is the interpretation of the PGC,s and
not   necessarily that of the PUCT or other Stakeholders.
8. How much of a product or entitlement is available in A/S?

The order adopting the final rule can be found at
http://www.puc.state.tx.us/rules/rulemake/21405/121900adt.pdf  the actual
rule starts at page 41 of 65.

Please review and comment.

Sta.3, 4 and 5

As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required
to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff
Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample
collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months
completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to
send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a
monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor
station.

Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2
agencies:

Navajo Nation EPA
P.O. Box 339
Window Rock, AZ 86515

Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager


US EPA    Region IX
75 Hawthorne Street
San Francisco, CA 94105

Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6)


Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation
EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated
that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also.

I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab
selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station
4 and 5 reports to station 5.

The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking
water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some
changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the
submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022..
