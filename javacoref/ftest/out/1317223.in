We are planning a party!

It has been a while since the group has had a party,
and my daughter is going to be a year old.  So we are
planning a party for November 11th, and Vandhana
and I would like to invite everyone in Research and
their family.

As yet we do not have the venue fixed, but please
keep November 11 (Sunday) free.

Please RSVP so that we can plan on the numbers.

Regards,
Sandeep.
