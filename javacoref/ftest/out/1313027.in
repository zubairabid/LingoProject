Dear Algebra Students,
You successfully completed Trimester I, and we're headed into Trimester
II. As I'm sure you've already noticed, the material is getting more and
more challenging. You should also be aware that I will be expecting more
and more higher level thinking as the year progresses. The Unit 4 Test
is a good example of the thinking skills that I'd like to see. The
multiple choice questions were quite challenging and required that you
apply what we'd learned. Although the class average was 73 on this test,
and many of you scored lower than you normally do, I think that we have
to give ourselves credit for "passing" such a challenging test. The best
news is that your portfolio grades will more than make up for a lower
test score. One might say that I even planned it that way. :-) Now, we
have to get ready for the next test. It will be a similar test in style
and difficulty, and we won't be doing a portfolio. So, you should take
the Unit 4 Test and study the type of questions that you missed. Don't
worry...I know you can handle this! By the end of the year, you will be
a superb test taker and algebraist!
PS: Don't forget to discuss your Unit 4 Test score with your parents.
They had to take challenging tests in their day (:-)), and they can help
you prepare for the types of questions (even if they've forgotten some
of the math).
