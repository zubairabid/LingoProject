I have been receiving a few calls about where to pick up a costume?
The address is as follows:

Costume Shoppe 570-2466  1317 - 9 Ave. SE
It seems that most people are leaving the task of picking out their
costume until the last minute.  Margo has introduced lots of new costumes
for this year.  Hint, Hint - the later you leave it, the bigger the line up
at the Costume Shoppe.

We would really like to encourage all of our Deputies to wear a
costume.

If you have any questions, please give me a call at 260-3412.

thanks,  Sheila
