Thanks, Lamar.  The ARM coalition's attorney is drafting the comments, which should be ready for review later this morning.  The comments will deal exclusively with the rules governing the DA suspension and won't address the contracts issue--comments on Carl Wood's demand to see the contracts will come later in the week, or first thing next week.
With respect to the positions in the comments, it's a composite of the positions of many ESPs and their customers.  Appears that some ESPs in the ARM group may want to assign customers to another ESP, which is why those comments are there.  Also, some customers want to be classified as DA in perpetuity, irrespective of their contract terms--which is why renewal, or the ability to change to another ESP, will get a lot of play.  And as you know, UC is being very aggressive in our planning meetings about facility-adds.
We could file separately, but the combined push for 1) establishing liberal suspension rules and 2) keeping contracts out of the Commission's hands will come from other folks and is likely to be pretty strong.  Not sure that separate comments would get us any additional value.  Let us know what you think.
In addition, Carl Wood isn't very interested in balancing suspension rules with the need to review contracts.  He's taking a "chain saw" approach.  He claims that he wants to see the contracts in order to determine whether he can re-set the suspension date retroactive to July 1, which the rest of the Commission currently does not seem to support.  In short, he appears hell-bent on trying to get his hands on people's contracts.  At this point the industry seems pretty solidly united in its opposition to giving them to him.
We're contacting the other Commissioners to determine whether Wood is out on his own on the contract issue--our sense at this point is that he may not have any support from other commissioners.  We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
I'll forward the draft ARM comments to you and Kevin later this AM.  If you have any other quesitons, let us know.
On the cost allocation issues, that's on a slightly slower track, but in the same forum.  Edison's position is the one they proposed to us in negotiations, which we rejected--1) all customers pay for Edison's undercollection (bundled and DA alike), 2) all customers pay for stranded DWR long-term contracts (bundled and DA alike).   The advice letters regarding implementation of the DA suspension don't offer any real detail on allocation and those issues will be hard-fought over during the first part of Q1.  That's the status thus far.  We'll know more on December 12th, when the Commission will hold another hearing on how it plans to address these issues over the next 60-90 days.
