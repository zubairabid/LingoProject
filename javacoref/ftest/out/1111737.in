Following my 8/8/01 e-mail on this subject, below is an update.

NY and NJ
We have finalized the customer scripts for NY and NJ. Attached are the latest drafts with final amendments. Per the below e-mail, I have determined that Enron will not be required to register as a telemarketer in NY. This removes the additional time required to process the registration application and a $25,000 bonding requirement. Barring further amendments today, a clean copy of the scripts will be generated for roll out.

TX
We have finalized the Your Rights as a Customer (YRC) disclosure, the Terms of Service(TOS), and the Electricity Facts Label (EFT) to insure compliance with the specific rule provisions regarding telemarketing. Attached are the latest drafts with final amendments. A clean copy will be generated for roll out.

I also attach the latest timeline for the conclusion of the process.

I have emphasized to relevant business people, that to protect Enron from any rule violations by our outsourced telemarketing agent, we must show that we have established and implemented written procedures, and have trained their personnel to comply. I will be happy to review training materials to insure compliance.

Please call with any questions.

Thanks,
Gloria
