FYI!  Pacific Atlantic Resources is going to be adding a new meter to their
existing contract.  The meter is on CNG (Hastings) and the number is
3571701.  The meter is estimated at 10 dth/day.  The well name is Morris #1
and is located in Ritchie County, WV.  Please let me know if anyone has any
questions.

Thanks,
Heidi
