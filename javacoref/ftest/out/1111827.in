In order to explain who WECC is, I must lay a little historical background.  If you will recall, when EPAct'92 was passed, the usual view was that FERC could order wheeling, but only on a case by case basis.  There had been an effort to include an RTG provision in the bill, but it died when the conference committee was finalizing the bill.  There was a view by many in the West at the time, that it would still be better to move ahead with self-implementation of open access rather than waiting for litigation.  In the summer of 1994, first WRTA (Western Regional Transmission Assocation) then SWRTA (Southwestern Regional Transmission Association) and NRTA (Northwest Regional Transmission Association) were filed.  They were developed in an open process that included, perhaps for the first time, the transmission owners, the transmission dependent utilities, new market entrants and state regulators.  The IPPs and Marketers were participants, including Enron, Electric Clearing House (now Dynegy), DesTec, CalPine, Tenaska, etc.  FERC responded in November telling WRTA that it would have to accept comparable transmission access.  Instead of collapsing as predicted by the "just say no" crowd, the members accepted the conditions and accepted those conditions.  WRTA formed in June of 1995.

While the RTGs appear rather tame today, at the time they challenged the traditional view, offering to provide open access tariffs.  When the FERC issued the NOPR that gave us Orders 888/889 just prior to WRTAs formation, the participants in the three Western RTGs members responded during the summer of 1995 by working together to develop the key concepts of what became OASIS.  With the filing of the current OATTs, much of the ground breaking work of the RTGs was done, but they remained a forum for discussion of the interface between commercial and reliablity.  A common planning data base was developed in which included non-traditional participants and their ideas to be included.  The Western Market Interface Committee (WMIC) was organized by the RTGs and has had a continuing role in bringing the the three (soon to be two?) RTOs proposals together.

When the Western RTGs were organized in 1995 they were formed outside of WSCC.  WSCC had a very restrictive policy, allowing only utilities to be members.  When they grudgingly allowed IPPs to join, it was still by half-measures.  For instance, WSCC would allow only employees of the member to attend, so new, small members could not employ a consultant for joint representation.  When the RTG discussions were underway, the good old boys wanted it inside WSCC with the same kinds of restrictions.  We broke that mold, formed separately and then through the FERC order approving WRTA force WSCC to open its membership fully or to face the creating of a separate planning organization.  The change passed by one vote, but the change occured.

Once all the organizations were up and running (WSCC, WRTA, NRTA, SWRTA) it was obvious that there was substantial duplication of meetings and functions.   Serions talks of a merger began in about 1998.  They went very slowly, but finally produced a common organization to be called the Western Electric Coordinating Council (WECC), which would merge WSCC, WRTA and SWRTA together initially.  NRTA will likely vote to merge as well.  WECC is a RRG as far as NERC is concerned.

While the new bylaws do not go as far as I would have liked, they do further open up the WSCC process and provide for some consideration of the commercial impact of reliablity rules.  Is this a transitional phase? Perhaps.  Does it go as far as the EISB proposal?  No, but I see no reason to play "smash-em, bash-em" will every effort that hasn't followed the latest turn in our thinking.  As I hope this memo shows, we have been evolving the industry, never as fast as Enron or others (myself included) have wanted it to change.  The WECC will reconsititue the WSCC board under new membership rules and opens the possiblity of changing the entrenched senior staff as WSCC to breath some life into the organization.  At a minimum, the change from WSCC/WRTA/SWRTA/NRTA to WECC will provide interim improvement while the debate over EISB works its way to a conclusion and further change takes place.
