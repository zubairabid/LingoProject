California Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante and Assemblymember Barbara  Matthews
(D-Tracy/Stockton area), held a press conference today to "introduce"  two
new "whistleblowers" from Duke Energy's South Bay plant. Bustamante  and
Matthews have filed a class action suit against out of state energy
companies.

The two employees, E. Robert Edwards (who spent 22 years at  the plant as an
electrician) and Richard J. Connors (21 years, started as a  laborer and rose
to auxillary operator), said they had little new to offer but  were there to
back up the testimony of the three former plant employees who  testified
before Sen. Dunn's committee. Among their claims were that the  plant did
not run at its potential capacity during periods of rolling blackouts,  that
part supplies were reduced or removed to slow maintenance, and even that  the
emphasis on safety was reduced.

Edwards said thatthe225 MW Unit 4 was kept offline  during a period of
rolling blackouts. He also said that Units 1 and 2 were  run at 100 MW
instead of their 150 MW capacity.

Connors noted that units were taken offline on weekends, and  that employees
"dreaded" Sunday night-Monday morning shifts because "they would  have to run
around" to bring units on line. A Duke spokesman said after  the press
conference that they do shut down some of the units on weekends  because the
state doesn't need the power and the cost of production is higher  than the
market price.

The employees also claimed that one turbine which uses liquid  fuel was used
more than they ever remember in place of steam turbines.  Connors said the
15 MW generated through the use of jet fuel, oil, etc. could  have easily
been produced by making adjustments to one of the operating steam  turbines.

Ray Boucher, the attorney on the case, said the alleged  actions could
violate anti-trust laws. He claimed that documents say Duke  bought the
South Bay plant because they knew it would enable them to exercise  market
power.

Bustamante dismissed the ISO's confirmation that it had  ordered the plant
torampup and down during Jan. 16-18, the period  discussed by the three
previous whistleblowers. He said that Duke's  withholding of electricity and
bidding practices had affected how the ISO had  been forced to manage power,
and that it is essential to examine bidding records  during that period.

Boucher said even though the state is looking at $9 billion in  alleged
overcharges, the class action suit could ask for more. "I think it  goes
deeper than that (the $9 billion)," he said.

Bustamante made two incorrect statements during the press  conference. He
tried to bolster the credibility of Connors and Edwards by  saying that they
had been kept on the job for two years after the plant's  takeover by Duke,
which shows their value. He was reminded that AB 1890  required keeping
existing employees fortwo years. (Connors said he  was offered employment
by Duke but turned them down; Edwards indicated he took  an enhanced
severance package.)

The second was in regard to a claim by one of the former  employees that he
had been told that the spare parts supply had been reduced in  order to lower
"inventory taxes." Bustamante made the comment, "We don't  have an inventory
tax." It's true that California no longer taxes  inventory (in retail
stores, for example), but counties do charge an ad valorem  tax on on-site
business property.

I sat a couple of seats away from Tom Williarms, spokesman for  Duke,
whomade under-the-breath commentsthrough most of the press  conference such
as "That's so wrong." Following the press conference, he  held an
availability in the hallway. He said that there was a fundamental
difference in operation the employees didn't understand: The South Bay
plant now serves the ISO market, while it used to serve a targeted southern
California market under SDG&E. Williams also claimed the plant was  under
severe environmental constraints for NOx that limited its available run  time.

Duke, he added, did not want to charge the high prices -- over  $3,000/MWh
--it did but included an 80% credit premium because the  utilities were not
creditworthy.To date, he said,it has only  received 1.8 cents on the
dollar.Williams said Duketried to  sell the power to DWR instead at a much
lowerrate, but was  refused.Duke has since refunded some money, Williams
said,andhas offered to re-bill at FERC's price-mitigation  rate.
