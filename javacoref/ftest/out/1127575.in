Rod wanted me to point out to you that NNG IT would be spending an additional $4.9 of capital in 2001 with approximately $4.2 spent in Nov.  This is reflected on the 2001 Capital by month schedules I sent you.  Stan had approved $9.0, but IT was able to negotiate their cost down to the $4.9.   The dollars will be spent on purchasing the SAN (Storage Area Network) equipment.  This $4.9 was not in the 2001 capital budget nor reflected in any other quarterly or current estimates.   cvb
