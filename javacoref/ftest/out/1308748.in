1) Fully agree with Steve. Only large industrials are assumed to bring elasticity to demand in the absence of full retail competition. (or under emergency situations, such as rationing, when the regulator may establish that all customers recieve price signals above a certain baseline consumption). I would  dare to say that even less than 20% of load being price sensitive (on a time interval basis) would have a significant impact on price spikes (and therefore on the entire logic for payment for capacity/reserves). CERA has just produced an interesting report. In the Northeast US, NY has had the best demand response - despite being a few thousand MW they may have alliviated significant curtailment. One may hypothesize why customer response has been so modest in genera;. One possible explanation is that, under the threat of  rolling black-outs, customers do not want to face the inconvenience (and investments) or responding to demand. Situation may change in the future as they get used and perceive the real benefits of participating in this game. That is why our ICAP paper relies heavily on demand response to make sure that the market will always clear.

2) As far as the LSE holding forward call options, (as an intermediary solution). I think this is an idea originally developed by Oren, from Berkeley. He basically states that LSEs (or large industries) should decide their desired exposure to the spot price, by holding more or less of those options. Options should be backed by real generation (in this case reserves). In Oren's view, this avoids the syndrome of one size fits all. Instead of all players buying for the same reliability level, the scheme would allow each participant to customize their risk preferences. This idea only makes sense if you impose a contracting requirement on LSEs (otherwise, the free-ride problem would still be there and because of the risk of curtailment the market would not be able to clear). In earlier versions of our Icap paper, we drafted this idea as a possible alternative (I can send you older versions, if you want to go further into the subject). However, Larry Ruff and some of our trading guys disliked the concept of any kind of mandatory contract requirement (which I understand goes hand in hand with the call option proposal). If we had to choose, Larry would rather go for the British LOLP x VLL model instead of the mandatory contract requirement.

To be fully consistent with our paper, you should state our interim proposal, and explain why it is superior to the former UK model (LOLP) or the Oren's proposal (mandatory requirement). Or, alternatively, you should stress that Oren's idea only works if you impose a mandatory contracting requirement (over and above your forecasted load).
