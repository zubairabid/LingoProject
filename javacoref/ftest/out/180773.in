Rate hikes bigger worry than blackouts, poll says
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published May 22, 2001)
The vast majority of Californians expect to be inconvenienced by power
blackouts this summer, but two-thirds continue to be far more concerned about
higher electricity rates they believe are unjustified, according to a Field
Poll released Monday.
Meanwhile, 85 percent of the state's residents say they have cut back their
energy use since the crisis began, and nearly two-thirds believe they can
conserve an additional 5 percent to 10 percent.
As they were at the outset of the crisis, poll respondents remain skeptical
of the power shortage's root cause. Nearly six out of 10 say the crisis is an
attempt by energy companies to increase rates, rather than the results of a
real market imbalance.
"As the seriousness of the issue has gone up, the cynicism has remained
high," said Mark DiCamillo, director of the San Francisco-based poll. "The
public still doesn't buy the claim that it's supply and demand. They think
it's an artificial crisis."
The poll results, obtained by interviewing a cross-section of 1,015 adults
between May 11 and Sunday, are part of a special survey the Field Institute
undertook to measure public opinion about the energy crisis. Subsequent
releases will survey attitudes about the available policy options and the
policy-makers who might exercise them.
Monday's results show Californians are reacting negatively to higher
electricity rates, even though the most recent increase has yet to appear on
their monthly bills.
In a finding nearly identical to Field's January survey, 67 percent are more
concerned with higher rates than power blackouts.
And that does not bode well for the elected officials trying to solve the
problem, DiCamillo said. Pocketbook issues such as rate increases, he said,
"focus more public opinion on the actors in this drama -- the politicians."
A majority (52 percent) believes the $5 billion rate increase approved by the
state Public Utilities Commission last week for customers of Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison was not justified, and an
identical proportion believes the rate increase will cause a "somewhat" or
"very serious" problem in their households.
The proportion of people who believe the increases will cause "very serious"
problems corresponds to their family income. Among those earning $20,000 or
less, 27 percent believe the increases will cause very serious problems. Ten
percent of those earning $80,000 or more believe very serious problems will
occur.
In contrast, 27 percent say blackouts have caused a "great deal" or "some"
inconvenience thus far, although 71 percent believe expected blackouts this
summer will cause the same degree of inconvenience. More low-income residents
(45 percent) say they will experience a great deal of inconvenience from
summer blackouts, compared with just 26 percent of those in the $80,000 and
above category who feel the same way.
The poll shows that the 85 percent of respondents who estimated they have
conserved power have cut back, on average, about 8 percent. Gov. Gray Davis
has asked all residents and businesses to reduce power use by
10 percent, although Davis' plan assumes a 7 percent reduction. Eighty-five
percent also say they can conserve even more, with additional savings, on
average, amounting to 4 percent.
Six out of 10 believe the state can avoid blackouts this summer through
conservation.
"These numbers are a good guess as to what real conservation is being
achieved and what is likely to be achieved, and it's not a huge amount,"
DiCamillo said.

Energy Digest: Half-hour warning for blackouts?


(Published May 22, 2001)
Grid operators are hoping to issue power blackout warnings a half-hour in
advance, but the new alerts would be educated guesses and blackouts might not
follow.
The proposed warning system is expected to be approved Thursday by the board
of the California Independent System Operator, the Folsom-based organization
that runs most of the state's high-voltage transmission system.
Although an unknown number of the alerts will turn out to be false alarms,
"this would be a huge step forward" for businesses, said Carl Guardino, head
of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and a member of the ISO board.
"For employers, a half-hour is the time needed to fire up a major generator,
to power down an assembly line, to have your employees save what they have on
their computers," he said.
By comparison, the last two rounds of rotating blackouts came with two- and
six-minute warnings, Guardino said.
The new system could be put in place by June 1, and might also include
expanded systems for giving e-mail notifications of power alerts or potential
blackouts, ISO officials said.

Connell plans to borrow
State Controller Kathleen Connell says Gov. Gray Davis' energy plan doesn't
add up.
Connell said at a news conference Monday that the state will spend money on
electricity at a faster rate than anticipated by Davis, a fellow Democrat.
As a result, Connell said, she expects to borrow about $4 billion this fall
to avoid state budget cash shortages in the coming fiscal year.
"We are virtually in the same kind of fiscal environment that we were in a
bad budget year," Connell said.
In recent years, the state has regularly borrowed money through one-year
revenue anticipation notes to avoid cash-flow problems. The notes are paid
off within a year when enough tax money flows to the state treasury.
But Connell didn't have to resort to borrowing this year because of plentiful
revenue and a healthy reserve.
Connell said the state's energy purchases have changed the picture, and
called into question Davis' assumptions. The governor's plan calls for 11
percent of the power purchases in the first half of this year to be covered
by lower-cost, long-term contracts. As of last week, only 1 percent of the
purchases were under contracts, Connell said.
But Joe Fichera, Davis' financial adviser, said that seven more long-term
contracts for electricity during peak demand periods this summer will be
delivered to Connell's office today.

Suit to seek price caps
The state Legislature plans to file suit today in federal court in a bid to
force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on power
prices.
The lawsuit will argue that the commission has failed to ensure that
Californians are paying just and reasonable rates, as required under the
Federal Power Act.
The suit is being filed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Hertzberg
said consumer groups and others are also expected to join the suit.
As evidence, the suit will cite reports earlier this year by the California
Independent System Operator that the state's electricity market was not
resulting in just and reasonable rates. The ISO is responsible for running
the state's transmission grid.
The suit will cite evidence of how high power rates are causing harm to
society, Hertzberg said.
--John Hill

U.S. attacks special rate
Before the idea goes any further, the federal government Monday asked state
utility regulators to junk a proposal for a special, high-priced federal
energy rate.
In an emergency appeal, federal officials asked the state Public Utilities
Commission to take a special vote Thursday to drop the idea of even
researching a pilot program, calling it discriminatory and a waste of time.
As part of a vote last week that created new electricity rates, the PUC also
launched a study into charging all federal facilities market-based prices for
power -- a move widely seen as a dig against federal authorities who have
refused state pleas to cap wholesale prices.
But three of the five PUC commissioners said at the time that they disliked
the idea and would consider other options.
Given their reluctance, it would be a waste of utilities' scarce resources to
even begin researching how to assess the special rate, the Department of the
Navy wrote the PUC on Monday, arguing on behalf of all federal executive
agencies.

What's the hang-up?
Clotheslines save energy and money, but they are considered unsightly by some
and are banned in many areas
By Mary Lynne Vellinga
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 21, 2001)

Rising electricity rates have prompted Stacey Swett to seriously consider
taking a step she finds somewhat distasteful: hanging a clothesline in her
back yard.
"I don't really like the looks of them, but you have to get past that; we
have a huge issue here with our SMUD bill," Swett said.
The California Energy Commission touts clotheslines as a nearly cost-free way
to conserve electricity. Statewide, clothes dryers burn about 1,000 megawatts
of electricity on a hot summer day, which could be enough to avert a blackout
on days when state power supplies are tight. An electric dryer costs about
$130 a year to run. A retractable clothesline will set you back about $14.99.
People appear to be getting the message. Hardware stores report a sharp rise
in clothesline sales since the energy crisis hit. People are "going back to
the old way of doing things," said Dave Haskin, owner of Broadway Hardware in
Sacramento.
But the old way of doing things doesn't sit so well in some newer
neighborhoods. Where Swett lives, in midtown, she can decide for herself
whether to take the plunge and pin up the bloomers. But in many newer
neighborhoods -- those governed by homeowners associations -- the practice is
not allowed.
Swett works for the management company that runs the homeowners association
for the gated, Pocket-area subdivision of Riverlake. In Riverlake, it is
against the rules to hang your laundry where your neighbors can glimpse it.
The same is true in Gold River, Rancho Murieta, Laguna West and Los Lagos,
the mansion-studded Granite Bay enclave where Sacramento Kings stars Chris
Webber and Jason Williams live.
"People think (clotheslines) are unsightly," said Dan Kocal, owner of the
Folsom-based Kocal Management Group. His company manages the homeowners
associations for 70 communities in the Sacramento region. Not one of them
allows clotheslines unless they are shielded from neighbors' views below the
fence line or behind a special enclosure.
When people buy into planned communities such as Gold River, Los Lagos or Sun
City, they agree to certain rules designed to keep the neighborhood looking
neat and uniform, Kocal said.
"You agree that you're only going to park in the garage, that you're not
going to hang out clothes and that you're not going to paint your house
purple," Kocal said.
Clotheslines that can be seen from neighboring yards are banned by virtually
all the 35,000 California subdivisions and condominium complexes governed by
homeowners associations, said Richard Monson, president of the Pasadena-based
California Association of Homeowners Associations.
"We choose to live in neighborhoods that don't hang these things out," Monson
said.
A few weeks ago, Monson was quoted as saying that the sight of hanging
laundry is "akin to graffiti in your neighborhood." Cartoonist Garry Trudeau
since has devoted an entire week of his Doonesbury strip to lampooning
neighborhoods that don't allow clothes to be hung out to dry.
Now, Monson chooses his words more carefully. "When we talk about areas of
communities that are less desirable, we often associate those with
undesirable items that are in proximity to the buildings," he said. He stands
by his assertion that the sight of clothes flapping in the breeze could knock
15 percent off property values.
Brian Rosebrock, a supervisor at the new Home Depot in Elk Grove, doesn't
understand the stigma. When he was growing up in a rural area outside New
York City, his mother always dried the family's clothes on the line.
Rosebrock, 40, still likes the smell of sun-dried clothes. He hangs his
jeans, socks, sheets and other cotton items in the back yard of his Rosemont
house.
"It's just laundry. Everybody is a little uptight here," he said of
Californians.
He may have a point. Bruce Hackett, professor emeritus of sociology at the
University of California, Davis, said Californians harbor more negative
attitudes toward clotheslines than do people in the Midwest, where line
drying is more of a tradition.
About 10 years ago, Hackett did a survey of 45 UC Davis students and 35
single-family households in Green Bay, Wis. At the time, some students living
in married housing on the UC Davis campus were upset that they had to walk to
an isolated, screened area next to the trash bins to hang their laundry.
"The housing office said clotheslines make the place look like a tenement,"
Hackett said.
The attitude in Wisconsin was markedly different.
"On wash day, there were just clotheslines everywhere, which is something you
don't find here," Hackett said. "One woman told me that when you move into a
new home it's not really your home until your clothesline is up and your
clothes are on it."
In the wake of student complaints, the university eventually changed the
policy to allow the use of retractable clothes lines in the housing area,
Hackett said.
Leaders of several Sacramento-area homeowners associations said they couldn't
think of any instance in which a homeowner has asked permission to hang a
clothesline or has gotten in trouble for using one.
"I don't know of anyone who has a clothesline," said David Brickell,
president of the Los Lagos Estates Homeowners Association. He said the Los
Lagos neighborhood is very concerned about the energy crisis and thus "would
certainly consider" allowing clotheslines.
To save energy, the subdivision has started turning off its entrance fountain
at night and is considering buying a smaller fountain pump.
Monson, head of the statewide association, argued that there are many ways to
conserve energy without resorting to the public airing of laundry. Wet
clothes can, for instance, be hung in the garage or the utility room, he
said.
"The issue is not clotheslines, the issue is conservation, and hom'eowners
don't have to hang their clothes out of doors," he said.
But some energy-conscious citizens think discouraging the use of outdoor
laundry lines is ridiculous, given the state's energy situation.
Jennifer Putnam, 41, recently purchased a large umbrella-style apparatus to
dry clothes in her Jackson back yard.
"We were standing outside by the (electric) meter at one point, two or three
months ago. My husband said, 'Look at how fast that thing is going around.' I
said, 'The only thing on is the dryer.' "
"During World War II, we had to do certain things," Putnam continued. "Now,
we're looking at a power crunch, we're looking at saving an economy in
California. That's critical. That's important.  I really don't think Granite
Bay is going to turn into a slum because people put up things to dry their
clothes on."

Dan Walters: One year later, we know it wasn't just a simple game of golf


(Published May 20, 2001)

California will mark -- but certainly not celebrate -- an anniversary this
week. It was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over San
Diego, and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power, San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. began charging its customers high, market-oriented
rates for juice.
It was the beginning of the California energy crisis, or at least of public
and political awareness that something was wrong. And a year later, every
aspect of the crisis continues to grow worse. We are paying 10 times as much
for power as we were two years ago. We have amassed more than $20 billion in
private and public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consumer
power rates. And we face potentially life-threatening summer blackouts.
Certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year. They go
back to decisions in the 1970s to stop major power plant construction and
rely on conservation and alternative generating sources. And they include a
momentous decision in the mid-1990s to adopt a "deregulation" plan that was
an unworkable hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the
mercy of out-of-state generators. Of more currency is what was and wasn't
done in the last 12 months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled, and perhaps
uncontrollable, firestorm.
Gov. Gray Davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays
golf, "one hole at a time." Unfortunately for Davis, and for the state, it
was not a golf game, but one of three-dimensional, and perhaps
four-dimensional, chess. To manage the crisis effectively, the Democratic
governor needed the ability, either personally or through trusted aides, to
pull together its disparate elements into a cohesive whole.
The golfing approach was evident from the beginning, as Davis dealt with only
the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved, rather than
embracing it wholly and actively. Private and public energy experts warned
that what was happening in San Diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and
proposed that the 1996 "deregulation" be suspended, that rates be raised
slightly and that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into
long-term supply contracts to stabilize the market. But Davis and his
handpicked state Public Utilities Commission president, Loretta Lynch,
stalled for time.
Less than a month after the crisis first surfaced, the PUC voted 3-2 to
authorize long-term supply contracts at about 5 cents a kilowatt-hour --
slightly higher than wholesale prices had been, but ridiculously cheap by
contemporary standards. Publicly owned utilities saw the looming price
escalation and quickly locked up long-term supplies, but Lynch denounced the
commission action as "a wrong turn" that could lead to higher consumer bills,
and within days it was scuttled in legislation signed by Davis.
Rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively, Davis, Lynch and
the Legislature opted for an expedient fix in San Diego, rolling back retail
rates without addressing either supply or cost issues. Within weeks, private
utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesale
costs skyrocketed.
Last summer's failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment. It's
clear now, for example, that it was a mistake for the state to continue
buying power at sky-high rates when the utilities had exhausted their credit.
Having a new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the
market would bear.
A year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud, but didn't, Davis is
busily rewriting history and blaming others, principally Republicans, for the
dilemma. But the governor cannot, or should not, escape the responsibility
for approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf, or like some
routine political dispute, and thus failing to apply the aggressive and
sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset.
As Gen. George McClellan discovered at the Battle of Antietam during the
Civil War, the unwillingness to take risk often leads to greater carnage.

Daniel Weintraub: Energy crisis sapping California's confidence


(Published May 22, 2001)

California's energy crisis is becoming a crisis of confidence. As electricity
rates rise and blackouts mount, residents are losing faith in their
government's ability to deal with the one issue underlying this crisis and
almost everything else that happens in the state -- population growth.
Energy and growth, in fact, are intertwined in the minds of everyday
Californians to an extent not yet reflected in the debate inside the Capitol,
according to the results of a new poll from the Public Policy Institute of
California.
More than three-quarters of those surveyed statewide said they believe
population growth contributed to the electricity shortage. And even if the
energy crisis fades, people expect other problems associated with growth to
worsen.
The crisis, in other words, has only heightened a sense that many people
already had, a feeling that California's famous quality of life is threatened
by rapid growth and our failure to provide the public works and services
needed to make growth tolerable.
For the first time since the mid-1990s, more people say the state is headed
in the wrong direction (48 percent) than in the right direction (44 percent).
And 56 percent said they expect bad economic times in the year ahead. That's
a quick decline from January, when a majority said they thought the state was
on the right track and 62 percent expected good economic times ahead.
"There is some deep-seated anxiety about the way government works, the way we
plan for the future, the way we make law, the way big decisions are made by
the governor and the Legislature," said Mark Baldassare, a Public Policy
Institute researcher who conducted the poll. "People didn't have a great deal
of confidence in local and state government to begin with, and now they have
even less."
Asked to cite the most important problem facing the state, 43 percent named
energy. But fully one-quarter of those surveyed said growth or related
problems -- the environment, housing, and transportation -- were on the top
of their list. Just 6 percent named schools as the top problem, a big drop
from a year ago, and the same number cited the economy. Other perennial
favorites -- crime, health care, taxes -- barely registered on the scale.
By a wide margin, Californians view growth as inevitable, but that doesn't
mean they have to like it. More than 8 in 10 said the state's anticipated
climb from 34 million people to 45 million by 2020 will make California a
less desirable place to live.
Six in 10 said traffic congestion is already a big problem in their
community, and 23 percent said it was somewhat of a problem. Nearly
three-quarters said the availability of housing was a problem. Sixty-four
percent said air pollution was a problem, and 61 percent complained about the
lack of opportunity for well-paying jobs.
The poll's respondents were conflicted about how best to deal with these
problems. A large majority favored local control rather than letting the
state taking a more active role in guiding growth and development. Yet an
astounding 89 percent said local governments in a region should work together
rather than each city and county deciding growth issues on its own.
But in a reflection of their lack of confidence in government, 63 percent
said local citizens should make growth decisions by voting on ballot
initiatives, while 35 percent said it would be better for local officials to
make those calls after thorough planning reviews and public hearings. A
little more than half -- 51 percent -- said they would vote today for an
initiative to slow the pace of development in their community even if it
meant having less economic growth.
What does all this mean for the political world? It's been clear for months
that the energy crisis was sapping Gov. Gray Davis' popularity in the state,
and this poll confirms that trend. Six in 10 say they disapprove of the way
Davis has handled the energy crisis, and his overall approval rating has
slipped to 46 percent, from 63 percent in January.
Conventional wisdom has been that if Davis could somehow find his way through
the energy crisis, he still could cruise to re-election. But that may no
longer be the case. Sixty-seven percent of residents say the crisis has made
them less confident in the state government's ability to plan for the future.
Gone is the optimism Californians once had that growth would produce a more
vibrant economy and make life better for us all.
Californians have a vaguely uneasy feeling that things are slipping out of
control, that no one really has a grip on where this state is going and how
we are going to get there. The energy crisis is only the most vivid example
of our failure to cope with change. People are worried. Davis should be, too.

Panel pulls the plug on county utility plan



Backers blame SDG&E for bill's demise in Assembly committee
By Bill Ainsworth
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- An Assembly committee yesterday thwarted a bipartisan effort to
ease the way for San Diego County to form a municipal utility district that
backers say would bring residents cheaper and more reliable power.
Proponents of the plan said San Diego Gas & Electric and its parent company,
Sempra, engineered a political power play that ensured defeat of the
proposal. The utility was the main opponent.
"Their lobbyists just got on this thing and killed it," said Bill Horn,
chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, who attended
yesterday's hearing before the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee.
"They did a tremendous disservice to residents of San Diego County."

But a lobbyist for Sempra told the committee that forming a municipal utility
wouldn't solve the energy crisis because it would do nothing to increase the
supply of electricity.
"We're not in the middle of a utility crisis," said lobbyist Cindy Howell.
"It's a generation crisis."
The bill, which would have applied only to San Diego County, had strong
bipartisan support from local officials, including state Sens. Steve Peace,
D-El Cajon, and Dede Alpert, D-Coronado, who took the unusual step of
personally testifying before an Assembly committee.

But the proposal earned just three of the 10 votes needed to clear the
committee. All of the votes came from Republicans.
The bill's author, Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido, blasted the
stockholder-owned utility company for opposing the bill.
"They simply don't want a threat to their ability to make as much money as
they can on the backs of San Diego ratepayers," he said.
Proponents say forming a public utility would allow residents to tap cheaper
sources of power, especially future hydroelectric power planned by the San
Diego County Water Authority.
They argue that controlling some power plants could reduce the county's
dependence on expensive electricity now purchased by SDG&E on the wholesale
market. That, in turn, could lead to lower utility bills.
During the current energy crisis, communities with publicly owned power,
including Los Angeles and Sacramento, have paid much lower energy bills than
communities served by investor-owned utilities.
But current state law makes it difficult to create a local municipal utility
because it requires a majority of voters to endorse the plan in an election
in which at least two-thirds of registered voters turn out.
As a practical matter, that means approval likely would occur only during a
presidential election when voter interest is high.
Peace said the current law was written for a reason: to protect privately
owned utilities.
"The law was written on purpose by this Legislature to make it almost
impossible to form a municipal utility district," he said.
Wyland's legislation, Assembly Bill 206, would have changed the law to allow
majority-vote approval in the new district, without regard to how many voters
turn out.
A proposal to create a municipal utility would have to go through months of
local hearings before it could be placed on the ballot. Wyland said he didn't
expect the new agency to replace SDG&E but merely to give residents more
options over the long term.
Initially, Sempra opposed the bill because it would have given the new public
agency the power of eminent domain to take over transmission lines and other
facilities owned by SDG&E.
At the hearing yesterday, Wyland offered to strip eminent domain power from
the new agency.
But Howell, the Sempra representative, still opposed the plan and argued that
there is no reason to change the voting requirement in the current law.
Forming a utility district, she said, is a significant step that should
require high voter turnout.
The bill also drew opposition from unionized employees of Sempra.
Committee chairman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, voted against the bill, saying
it was vague and that San Diego legislators should get a better idea of what
they want to do.
He left open the possibility that he would support a proposal to allow the
county to buy power but not to form its own utility.
Wright, widely considered an ally of the privately owned utilities, received
$16,500 last year in contributions from Sempra, according to the Secretary of
State's Web site.
Other members of the committee objected to the proposed structure of the new
utility, which would be governed by a nine-member board of two supervisors,
two San Diego City Council members, three council members from county cities
and two public members.
The proposal seemed to turn the political parties' positions on public power
upside down.
The measure failed to win any votes from Democrats, who enthusiastically
endorsed a new state power authority that allows California to finance, buy
and seize power plants.
But the plan was supported by three Republicans, including Assemblymen Jay La
Suer of La Mesa, David Kelley of Idyllwild and Bill Leonard of Rancho
Cucamonga. Republicans opposed the state power authority, with some calling
it socialism.
Wyland said he may try to resurrect the proposal later in the year.







Business customers criticize proposed 29% SDG&E rate hike



By Craig D. Rose
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
SDG&E's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average
of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity.
At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday,
some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they
win the same rate freeze as residential customers.
"We need rates we can depend on," said John Roberts, who owns an irrigation
products business in San Marcos.
SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation, and the
utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the
state capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.
The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the
commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of
PG&E and Edison, which are about 3 cents per kilowatt-hour higher.
Yesterday's hearing, however, was for commercial rates.
Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a
tripling of power costs over the past year, while having to cut the cost of
its products because of competition, he said.
Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare
residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be
counterproductive.
"If businesses leave the state, they'll be without jobs, and a $30 savings on
their power bills won't mean much," Roberts said.
The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30
people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community
Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center, 330 N. Coast Highway.
Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases. Dates
for those hearings have not been set.







State sends $533.2 million to company, part of April bill



By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of
California, $533.2 million, went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power
purchased for California utility customers during a single month, April.
Mirant, formerly Southern Energy, says more than half of the power came from
three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas
and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan.
State Treasurer Kathleen Connell, who displayed a blown-up copy of the check
at a news conference yesterday, said she thinks the state has failed to
obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more
than the $13.4 billion planned.
Connell, an elected official who issues state checks, said the power bills
she had paid by last Thursday, totaling $5.1 billion, provide no basis for
assuming that the price of electricity "is dropping and that it will continue
to drop through the summer."
But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state, which has more long-term
contracts than Connell has seen, is on track to control power costs with the
aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional
borrowing.
"I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario,"
said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, a Davis consultant. "It's the expected
scenario."
The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that
will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases, about $7
billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers.
Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing
that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids.
A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force
disclosure.
Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She
declined to release details of the contracts, saying they are complicated and
have varying prices.
Connell said the check for $533,181,235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the
largest she has written since taking office in 1995.
"This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices," Connell said, "even
though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases
power) has an executed long-term contract with this company."
Mirant said in a statement that, at the request of the state, its marketing
arm gave the state a "helping hand" by buying power from suppliers not
willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state.
"We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its
behalf," said Randy Harrison, Mirant's Western chief executive officer, "and
it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative
light."
Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April,
while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the
total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours.
The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour.
That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive
spot market during the second quarter of this year, from April through June.
But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have
been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the
state.
Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3,000
megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public
Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their
fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost
power to California.
The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing
more than 20,000 megawatts. The largest group of plants, 4,700 megawatts,
went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing
7,000 megawatts.
The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to
ward off blackouts, although temperatures are on the rise throughout the
state. More heat means more air conditioning, and a greater strain on the
system.
But starting next month, the state's electricity grid managers plan to
provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling
blackouts.
The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site "power
warnings" when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts
might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a "power
watch" when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand
days.
The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities
to cut power to customers, posting information about probable interruptions
on its Web site. Its Web site address is http://www.caiso.com
"There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike
that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's
what we are trying to do," ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said.
O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to
be worked out, including whether e-mails or pagers might be used.
In other developments in the electricity crisis:
About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to
375,000 households as part of the "Power Walk" program that began during the
weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door
in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million
conservation program.
Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor
for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore
as communication consultants for $30,000 a month. The Republicans said Mark
Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate "a partisan, cut-throat political
communications firm."
The state Auditor General said in a report on energy deregulation that the
state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new
power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for
quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about
20 percent of its power.

75% say power woes 'very serious'



By John Marelius
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
The overwhelming majority of Californians now regard the state's electricity
crisis as a serious problem, but say they have not yet been greatly
inconvenienced by it, a new Field Poll has found.
The nonpartisan statewide survey found that while people believe the
electricity problem is real, they believe it stems more from an attempt by
energy companies to drive rates up than from an actual shortage.
They are also far more worried about soaring electricity bills than the
threat of blackouts.
And Californians offered contradictory views as to whether electricity
conservation can head off blackouts this summer. They believe all electricity
consumers -- residents, businesses and government -- can reduce their usage
enough to avert blackouts. But they also say they already have cut back their
own usage about as much as they can.
In January, the Field Poll surveyed public attitudes about the growing
electricity crisis. At the time, 58 percent characterized the situation as
"very serious." Now, the percentage of the population that considers the
situation "very serious" has grown to 75 percent.
Californians also hold a rather cynical view of the crisis. Thirty-six
percent say they believe it is the consequence of an electricity shortage,
but 59 percent say it was caused by energy companies seeking to increase
profits.
The Field Poll is based on telephone interviews with 1,015 California adults
conducted between May 11 and Sunday. According to statistical theory, the
poll would be accurate 95 percent of the time within a margin of error of 3.2
percentage points.
So far, the ill effects of the electricity crisis are ones Californians seem
to be willing to live with. But they worry that will not be the case much
longer.
Eleven percent said they had been inconvenienced "a great deal" by blackouts.
But looking toward the summer, 34 percent said they expected blackouts to be
a major inconvenience.
Likewise, 19 percent said the electricity rate increases averaging 10 percent
that have taken effect have been a very serious problem for them. If rates
were to go up another 10 percent, 36 percent would regard that as a serious
problem.
Opinion is divided over the merits of recent rate increases approved by the
state Public Utilities Commission. Forty-one percent called them justified
and 52 percent called them unjustified.
"It's not overwhelmingly panned, which I suppose is about as well as could be
expected on an issue like this," said Mark DiCamillo, associate director of
the Field Poll. "It's almost like a tax increase. The public doesn't want it;
it's just whether they think it's justified or not."
Looking ahead, 28 percent say blackouts are the greatest threat posed by the
electricity crisis. But more than twice as many, 67 percent, say they are
more concerned about escalating electricity bills.
By a significant ratio, 61 percent to 34 percent, Californians believe
additional conservation measures by all electricity users can eliminate the
need for summer blackouts.
But when it comes to their own electricity consumption, they say they already
have cut back significantly and can't do much more.
Californians say they have reduced their household electricity usage by an
average of 8 percent. They said they could cut back by another 4 percent in
their homes without causing serious problems.
"If the state is looking and the governor is looking for redoubled efforts,
it's going to be painful because the public thinks we can do a little bit
more, but not a lot," said DiCamillo.






Governor told to try seizure in power war



By Philip J. LaVelle
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 19, 2001
A major San Diego business group urged Gov. Gray Davis yesterday to take
emergency steps in the energy crisis, including seizing power plants -- an
action the governor said may be in the cards.
Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego
Building Owners and Managers Association, overseers of about 250 commercial
properties here.
The meeting, at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown, was closed
to the media.

In remarks to reporters later, Davis repeated his hard line against
out-of-state energy producers, relating a threat made to a dozen power
executives in a private meeting May 9.

"I told the generators face to face, as close as I am to you ...
'Gentlemen, you are going to lose your plants, and I'm going to sign a
windfall-profits tax, unless you help us get through this summer without
blackouts and without staggering prices.'"
Davis also said he told them: "You know you've been ripping us off, acting in
a predatory manner. If you do it this summer, you leave me no choice but to
take your plants and sign a windfall-profits tax. So the ball is in your
court, gentlemen."
Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had "a frank
exchange" with Davis. "We want to do our fair share (on conservation), but
we're also concerned about the supply side," he said. The group "strongly
urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary, including
seizing plants."
Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of
conservation measures. Yet some cannot be implemented without state
intervention, she said. For example, Davis urged that air-conditioning
thermostats be set at 78 degrees, but "a lot of our leases don't permit it,"
she said.
While in San Diego, Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree from
Scripps Research Institute.






Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation



ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
LOS ANGELES ) The head of the California Public Utilities Commission provided
a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduced
electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.
While testifying before the committee Friday, PUC President Loretta Lynch
displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at
three plants on a single day last November.
According to the graphs, after the plants reduced production during the
middle of the day, the state was forced to declare two separate power
emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low.
After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices, the companies
operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to
almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates.
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which is
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and
playing, to an extent, California."
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said.
She would not identify the power plants involved, however, Lynch did say that
they are owned by at least two companies.
Sen. Joseph Dunn, who heads the special committee investigating alleged
market manipulation, said Lynch's testimony, on its face, is "very damning."
He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing
that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior.
During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of major
power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no
coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits.
"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy
Producers Association.
The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and
brought major utilities to financial ruin.







State to Issue Warnings of Power Outages
Electricity: Cal-ISO says it will try to give residents and businesses
24-hour notice of probable blackouts.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers

Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes
this summer, courtesy of the energy crisis: "The 405 Freeway is jammed,
there's a slim chance of showers, and oh, by the way, there's a 50%
likelihood of blackouts."
By the end of this month, the California Independent System Operator,
the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour
forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected.
It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses,
government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable
blackout in their area.
Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air,
but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than
10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via
wireless communications such as pagers.
Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses,
particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were
costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political
pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is
expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of
electricity.
If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's,
Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making
increased notification crucial.
With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken
Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the
agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700
megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility
industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that
California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer.
"The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know
they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them,
they will check in," said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who
serves on the Cal-ISO board.
Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board
meets Thursday. But a Web page called "Today's Outlook" on the agency's
Internet site, www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour,
how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there
is a predicted surplus or shortfall.
Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity
conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections
and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergency
that is expected.
A "power watch" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages,
and a more serious "power warning" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3,
which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power
reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.)
Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of
probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In
addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media,
Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on
"blast lists," or massive computer databases that it will assemble.
"The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we should
be deploying high-tech solutions," said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest
for better notification. "Every time California goes black, the economy sees
red."
Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just
two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react.
"A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is
insufficient to protect California businesses and the public," he said.
Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most
of the warnings, Florio said residents also will benefit.
"It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual
homeowners, but if someone works at home, and sets it up to get an e-mail
notice, they can take advantage," he said.
In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California's
power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity
purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4
billion more before it runs out of cash in February.
Calling a news conference in the capital, state Controller Kathleen
Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis'
financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4
billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and
cover future power buys for the next two years.
Connell's opinion is notable because, as the state's chief check writer,
the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices
the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through
long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret.
Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's
warnings.







Businesses May Seek Blackout Exemption
Energy: PUC will accept new applications, which would be granted only to
minimize danger to public health and safety.

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer


The San Francisco Giants want one, and so presumably do most other
California businesses: an exemption from the rolling blackouts that experts
say are all but certain this summer.
But whether operating on a baseball diamond or in more mundane venues
far from the bright lights of pro sports, few businesses will be granted such
waivers--and then only to minimize threats to public health and safety--under
a process detailed Monday by the California Public Utilities Commission.
"It would be nice in a perfect world if we could exempt everyone who
asks from rolling blackouts. Unfortunately, we can't do that," Commissioner
Carl A. Wood said in announcing the procedure for applying for blackout
exemptions.
The PUC already exempts a fairly lengthy list of those whose services
are needed to protect public health and safety, including fire and police
stations and acute-care hospitals.
Energy experts are predicting blackouts this year ranging from a total
of 20 hours at the most optimistic to 200 hours or more, based on such
factors as historic patterns of electricity usage, forecasts for hot weather
and expectations of diminished hydroelectric imports from out of state.
Any new business exemptions, which would start no sooner than August,
would be granted only to minimize danger to public health and safety.
That means a business would not be granted an exemption from outages
just because it fears revenue loss, Wood said at a Los Angeles news
conference.
Residential customers will be unable to apply for the exemptions.
Nevertheless, many already enjoy blackout protection by quirk of location--if
they share a circuit with an exempt customer--or if they are customers of the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and municipal utilities such as
those in Glendale and Burbank that do not rely on the statewide power grid
for electricity.
The PUC can approve only a limited number of blackout exemptions, Wood
said, because to maintain system reliability, a pool of customers
representing at least 40% of total system load must be available for rolling
power outages.
Statewide, about 50% of system load is exempt from blackouts in the
territories served by the three big investor-owned utilities: Edison
International's Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric.
"This is not an exercise in determining who is most affected
economically by rolling blackouts. Everyone is affected economically by
rolling blackouts," Wood said.
The PUC has set up a Web site, www.rotating-outages.com, and toll-free
number, (888) 741-1106, for businesses seeking information and applications.
The deadline to apply is 5 p.m. June 1.
Completed applications will be reviewed by an engineering consulting
firm, Exponent Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., which will develop a priority list
based on risk to public health and safety.
Only businesses that have applied would be considered for exemptions,
Wood said, explaining that the commission will not excuse entire industries.
The PUC is expected to vote on the exemptions by Aug. 2.
Wood said several companies already have applied, including the
operators of Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, home of the Giants major
league baseball team.






Legislators Set to Sue Federal Energy Agency
Power: Lawmakers try a new idea: a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose danger
to people, law enforcement and even water supply

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy
regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing
homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight
crime, and the state's drinking water supplies.
Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a
new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's
energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer.
A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to set "just and reasonable" wholesale power rates as a way of
ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by
veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman
Oaks), and the city of Oakland.
"A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in
California," the draft says. "The public health, safety and welfare of the
state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of
rolling blackouts and punitive prices."

Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats
Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have
been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a
way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion
buying electricity since January.
In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will
stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people "are
left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and
electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed."
"Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men,
women and children with disabilities," the suit says. "They represent an
imminent threat to life, health and independence."
Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said
the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC.
Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School
in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck
Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers
had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he
became convinced the suit had merit.
"Let's face it," said Kelso, a Republican, "this is the single most
important issue that the state faces for the next six months."

Watching the Water Supply
The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the
implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health
Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The
warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to
consumers.
"If the water looks cloudy or dirty," the warning says, "you should not
drink it." The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water
quality, they can boil it or add "eight drops of household bleach to one
gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes."
Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that "if
an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour
blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water
because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially
contaminated water from the system."





California will forecast blackouts and warn the public

(05-22) 00:05 PDT (AP) --
Eds.: PMs.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The operator of California's electricity grid is
offering a partial answer to a major consumer complaint, planning to give the
public a half-hour's warning before shutting off the lights.
Beginning May 30, the Independent System Operator also plans to issue
warnings similar to weather advisories 24 hours before expected blackouts.
Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning,
saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a
last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have
also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars
and other criminals.
"Definitely, it's a good idea," said Shirley Starr, a racetrack employee in
the Los Angeles suburb of Rosemead. "If I know it's going to happen, I won't
defrost the refrigerator or something."
Like some business customers and consumer groups, she wondered if 30 minutes
warning would be enough.
"A lot of people, if they are at work, a half hour isn't going to do any
good," Starr said.
"I think it should be more than 30 minutes," said George Aguilar, an animal
control officer in El Monte. "It should be at least eight hours."
Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular
feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort
at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to
power air conditioners on hot days.
The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence
that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the
public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another
neighborhood.
Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the
state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left
without stoplights, trapped people in elevators, and caused business losses
by bringing production lines to a halt. People with home medical equipment
like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning.
The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: It
will issue a "power watch" or "power warning" that will give notice the grid
could be headed toward blackouts.
The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any
blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods
will be hit.
"It's better than no notice," said John Handley of California Independent
Grocers.
He said stores could use the warning to rush customers through checkout and
even move items to cold storage if necessary.
"Once the power goes out, we can't ring anyone up," Handley said.
Many small factories have production lines that cannot be interrupted without
risk to an entire lot of whatever they produce, said Brad Ward, president and
chief executive of the Small Manufacturers Association of California.
For example, a manufacturer might be using acid to etch something on a piece
of metal. If power is shut off suddenly, the acid might not be removed in
time and the piece would be ruined.
"This is really, really good news," Ward said.
The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an
impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails,
faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages.

(05-22) 00:47 PDT (AP) --
Developments in California's energy crisis:
MONDAY:
* No power alerts as reserves stay above 7 percent.
* State power grid operators say they'll soon be giving residents and
businesses 30 minutes notice before they order rolling blackouts. The
Independent System Operator will also be issuing a daily energy forecast with
projected supply and demand, and the likelihood of blackouts. Several
lawmakers say they'll introduce plans that would give Californians even more
notice of blackouts -- from one day to one month.
* The state auditor releases a report on the state's energy crisis, saying
previous estimates that the state could avoid blackouts this summer are
overly optimistic. The Bureau of State Audits also criticized the California
Public Utilities Commiss
