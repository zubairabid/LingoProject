Thanks, Melissa.  That clears up most of my questions.  However, on Avista, they inadvertently included their ISO bill with their October bilat transaction invoice, and the full amount was paid.  Their ISO amount was $151,686.52, which, when compared to our actual, is $13,543.24.  They should be invoiced for that amount.

I will let you know when we can schedule a conference call.  I would imagine that all of Volume Management will need to be included in the conversation.
