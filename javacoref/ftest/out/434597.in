Ladies, I tried to get us a reservation at Ceili's but they don't take
reservations on Thursday and Friday nights because their happy hour fall on
those nights (first come first served attitude).
So, here's the dilemma, do we risk it and just head over to Ceili's and take
our chances we will get in or would you like to try and go somewhere around
Canterra (such as Brewsters, Fionn MacCools, Red Devil, etc.).  Let me know
your preference.
Nella
PS: We should try and be at any of these places by 5:00 at the latest in the
hopes that we can get in.  (It's times like these when you wished you worked
until 4:00 or 4:30 like the rest of the world.)
