I'd like to extend an invitation to all that would like to come to Open Art studios at my house this Saturday.  It's actually my housemate, David's exhibition, but I will be exhibiting some of my paintings as well.

It's part of SF Open art studios which is basically artists opening up their homes and studios and allowing complete strangers into their home. Not too smart if you stop and think about it.... It's very casual, so if your in the neighborhood, stop by and have a glass of wine.  Look in 'The Guardian' to find out more about Open Art Studios....

The address is 807 Cabrillo at 9th Ave  in the Richmond district, one block over from Golden Gate Park.  The doors will be open from 11:00 to about 6:00pm.  If you would rather experience the art from your computer, go to my web site:  http://www.LAart.com
