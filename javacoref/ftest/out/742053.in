You have confirmed by voice mail that V&E have been retained to defend the recent share holder derivative litigation.  To date, we have been made aware of six (6) lawsuits which have been noticed to underwriters.
I am receiving requests from V&E for copies of policies and other information and we have responded.  Normally,  V&E would be working through an Enron attorney and we would like to know if internal counsel has been appointed in this matter so that we can provide copies for their file as well. Please advise.
