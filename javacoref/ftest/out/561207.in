You need to work for Sally Beck on this.  She is responsible for this and is
a Managing Director responsible for all mid and back office, outsourcing or
otherwise.  She must approve anything that goes out becuase it will effect
her directly.
Phillipe is also very reluctant to "sell" any systems, especially if we have
to support applications installed behind their firewall.  We are probably
fine with most ASP models.  You need to meet with Sally as team on this ASAP.
After meeting with Sally, let me know what everyone agreed on.  I am in all
day.
Thanks.
