The following issues need to be addressed for the filing:

In regard to the trees within the station yard at Station 2 --- are we correct in saying we will be on "previously disturbed ROW"?  Is there an approximate 150 foot strip which has not been disturbed?  Will we be disturbing this 150 foot strip?  The minimum checklist for the environmental report takes issue with both being on/within "previously disturbed" and an "improved area" of existing facilities.
Have we contacted the National Forest Service regarding the disturbance of these trees?  Do we have assurance that they will have no problem with cutting down the trees and when do we expect their comments?
It's my understanding that we will be using previously disturbed ROW for Stations 1, 3, and 4.  If this is incorrect, please advise.
Revised plot plans based on site visit (Note: prior plans stated Station 3 is located in Section 13.  Draft environmental report stated no section because it had not been surveyed.  Which is correct?)
Has the scope been revised as a result of site visit?  What are we doing with the scrubbers and generators?  Electric unit at Station 1?
Will there be a revision to the $93.3 million cost?
Is there a revision to the following appurtenances:
abandonment:   station/unit control system
unit suction & discharge valving
header piping & branch sub-systems associated with each unit

gas & service piping will be disconnected & sealed off either by installation of blind flanges or weld caps

installation:	station ESD & unit control systems
backup power generator & associated control systems
gas cooler with electric driven fans
associated piping and valving for tie-ins into existing station yard piping
mods to existing fuel, water, oil, air & electrical sub-systems
mods to existing scrubbers
Need final environmental report including surveys and agency comments (written or phone log).
Have we received revised noise survey?
Need revised Exhibit G & diskette of Gregg Model.
