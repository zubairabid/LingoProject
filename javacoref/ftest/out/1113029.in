I am happy to keep Littlechild's output separate from what you will write about EU-wide energy liberalisation, Peter.
I hear your conference in Brussels went quite well. I hope Brendan and Doug both played their parts adequately?
I have asked Pamela to try to track you down in Florence or Dundee (not sure I have a tel. no. for former.) If you have definitely  been tasked with producing an EU Institute paper for the Barcelona EU Heads of State economic summit next Spring, to support progression of the liberalisation acceleration legislation, then I can give you plenty of ideas about justification and the practical differences it could make. We can have a preliminary talk by phone. After that I reckon it would be worth my collecting together some written material for you and then meeting. I assume that private funding is not required in this instance.
I am leaving Washington this afternoon, and should be back in circulation in Brussels later this week. Kind regards,
Peter.
