Jim, I am afraid I don't understand.  We do have UC/CSU on utility service
for all pg&E campuses and some SCE campuses. Therefore, I think they are
purchasing power from an electrical corp on or after 1/17/2001, so I dont
think this helps us.
In any event, we are in a dispute with UC/CSU.  They very much want to retain
their right to direct access - any legislative fix that would provide them
with the ability to return to direct access after AB1x would end our
dispute.  Is there anyway we can build in this flexibility?
One suggestion would be to say that any customer that was returned to utility
service because the utility was not paying negative CTC has the right to
return to direct access service at any time.  this is probably too technical,
though.  Any other ideas?
