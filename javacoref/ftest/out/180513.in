Double power punch: Rate hikes set; blackout blues ahead
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 16, 2001)
The shouts and chants, boos and catcalls were the sound of the other shoe
dropping.
Seven weeks after state regulators voted to raise electric rates for
customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison by
$5 billion annually, Tuesday they sorted out just who will pay and just how
much.
Some of the state's biggest industries will have to spend 50 percent more for
their electricity, starting June 1.
Even so, their cost per kilowatt-hour will be about half that paid by the
most electricity-guzzling homeowners and renters. Their bills, overall, would
increase 37 percent under a complex, five-step rate scale.
The decision dismayed representatives of small consumers and big businesses
alike, and triggered an outpouring of rage from those who said the state
instead should seize power plants from owners who have jacked up wholesale
prices.
"Shame, shame, shame, shame," protesters chanted after the 3-2 vote by the
state Public Utilities Commission before a packed auditorium in San
Francisco.
"This is a cave-in to the big industrial lobby and the big agricultural lobby
that's been on the warpath for the last week," said Mike Florio, an attorney
with The Utility Reform Network, a Bay Area consumer group.
For weeks, the commission has been backing away from ideas floated by PUC
President Loretta Lynch, who argued that substantially lower charges paid by
big businesses for decades need to be leveled out, to come closer to
residential and small-business rates.
A proposal she outlined in March would have raised some business rates at
some hours up to sixfold. But by last week, the largest business increases in
two different proposals had come down to no more than 55 percent. On Tuesday,
that was lowered again to 49 percent.
Even so, the decision was criticized by commissioner Richard Bilas as a
"disastrous rate design ... (that) will send the California economy into a
recessionary death spiral."
He warned that businesses will shut down or flee the state, with consequences
that will ripple through the economy as jobs and taxes are lost. Bilas and
Henry Duque, the two remaining Republican appointees on the five-member
commission, voted against the rate design proposed by Lynch. It was supported
by commissioners Geoffrey Brown and Carl Wood, who, like Lynch were appointed
by Gov. Gray Davis.
"Every consumer in California is justified in feeling outrage at the rates we
approve today and the bills they will have to pay tomorrow," Lynch wrote in
her 69-page decision, blaming the increases on "wholesale price gouging" and
inaction by federal regulators.
Lynch said the new rates will fuel conservation, but business interests have
argued that so many power users are fully or partly shielded that it will
blunt the conservation signal that could be sent by even higher rates.
Under Tuesday's decision, agricultural rate hikes were capped at 15 percent
to 20 percent, partly in response to Davis' urgings.
The governor, who had urged the commission to go easier on agriculture and
enact a lower overall increase, said in a statement that the rate hikes made
"modest improvements" over earlier proposals but "my plan represented a more
balanced approach."
The rate hikes also spare households that use less than 130 percent of a
minimal "baseline" amount to comply with a state law passed this year.
Pacific Gas and Electric's baseline varies depending on the region and the
season.
Households that qualify for special low-income rates or special medical rates
also won't face increases.
For other residential power users, electricity will get progressively more
expensive, but only above 130 percent of baseline, so overall bills won't
rise as sharply.
Under the five new residential rate tiers, a PG&E customer whose use tops out
in the third tier would pay an additional $6 a month, increasing an average
$76 bill about 5 percent to $81, the PUC calculated.
Those whose usage rises into the fourth tier would pay about 18 percent more
per month, seeing their bills rise from $122 to $143, and those whose usage
creeps into the fifth tier would pay an extra $85, or 37 percent of their
total bill, which would increase from an average of $232 to $317, the
commission said.
Small businesses would face increases ranging from 34 percent to 45 percent.
While the percentage increases would seem to favor smaller consumers, the
underlying rates are highest for residential customers.
Households with usage above 130 percent of baseline will now pay PG&E an
average of 22 cents per kilowatt-hour for the additional power, Lynch
calculated. That compares with 16.7 cents for small businesses, 14.2 cents
for agriculture, 15.4 cents for large commercial users and 12.2 cents for
industrial users, she wrote.
It was the comparatively lower rates for the biggest users that angered
advocates for residential consumers.
"I don't know why they feel compelled to give those guys a break when they're
the ones who wanted us to get into this deregulation mess in the first
place," said TURN's Florio.
But Bill Booth, who represents the California Large Energy Consumers
Association, said the decision is "a horrible result for business. This is
going to have a really negative effect on the economy."
Agricultural interests were more upbeat, with Ron Liebert, an attorney for
the California Farm Bureau Federation, praising the decision for recognizing
"the unique difficulties agriculture faces," including dwindling water
supplies, higher pumping costs and higher fuel costs for farm equipment.
The rate hikes allow PG&E and Edison to collect an additional $700 million
over the next year. That amount represents revenue that the utilities would
have collected if they had been able to immediately impose the rate hike
March 27, the day the increase was approved.
The rate hikes affect customers of PG&E and Southern California Edison, the
state's two largest investor-owned utilities. They don't affect customers of
ratepayer-owned systems such as the Sacramento Municipal Utility District,
where locally elected officials set rates. SMUD raises its rates an average
of 22 percent this month, driven partly by the same turbulence in wholesale
electricity markets that has sent PG&E into bankruptcy.

An energy council expects five times the outages forecast
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 16, 2001)
In the bleakest assessment yet of California's summertime energy shortage, an
industry association Tuesday predicted the state will suffer five times as
many rolling blackouts as previously forecast.
Moreover, the group said the blackouts will be twice as widespread --
affecting twice as many Californians at a time -- as any the state has
experienced this year.
The North American Electric Reliability Council predicted 15 hours of
blackouts a week through September, vs. about three hours under assumptions
released by the Independent System Operator, which runs California's power
grid. The council's prediction sharply contrasted with predictions by Gov.
Gray Davis, who has said the state will avoid major problems this summer.
"All indications are, there are going to be chronic problems this summer,"
said Tim Gallagher, manager of technical services at the reliability council.
He said Californians for the first time can expect blackouts during odd hours
and on weekends, instead of just the late-afternoon hours when electricity
consumption usually peaks.
A Princeton, N.J., nonprofit group funded by the energy industry and
dedicated to monitoring the nation's power supplies, the reliability council
said electricity supplies may be iffy this summer in the Pacific Northwest,
New York, New England and Texas. The only state where it predicted blackouts
was California.
Taking note of the ISO's study, the council was far more pessimistic about
the levels of available power this summer from California's existing
hydroelectric, nuclear and natural gas-fired generating plants. It also
predicted fewer imports from out of state and said California will get less
power than expected from the host of new power plants scheduled to begin
operation over the summer.
The council did say the demand for power is likely to be less than the ISO
estimated, thanks to the impact of conservation programs and a hefty rate
increase approved by the Public Utilities Commission. But the council said
conservation programs are likely to generate only a third of the savings
predicted by state officials.
California has experienced six days of rolling blackouts this year, including
two last week, the result of hydropower shortages, unexpected plant shutdowns
and the financial crisis facing the state's two main utilities, Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison.
The second blackout, on Jan. 18, was the most widespread, cutting power to
750,000 homes at a time.
The reliability council said the average blackout this summer will be twice
as bad, taking down 1.6 million homes at a time.
Predicting the impact of summertime blackouts has become something of a
cottage industry, with various independent consultants forecasting billions
in economic losses. Recently a consultant hired by top business lobbyists
said the state will lose 135,000 jobs if it suffers 110 hours of blackouts --
less than half as many hours as predicted by the reliability council, which
is owned by 10 Regional Reliability Councils whose members come from all
segments of the electric industry.
The effect on the business climate remains to be seen. "We really have no
experience with this," said chief economist Ted Gibson of the California
Department of Finance.
Various industry analysts have predicted anywhere from 20 to 36 days of
rolling blackouts this summer. The ISO has said the state could face
blackouts any day when total demand exceeds 40,000 megawatts, which happened
34 times last summer.
The ISO, which is scheduled to update its summer forecast next week, didn't
predict the number of hours of blackouts. But the reliability council fed
ISO's assumptions into its computer model and came up with 55 hours of
blackouts this summer. Using its own, more pessimistic assumptions, the
council estimated 260 hours, or about 15 hours a week.
"It wouldn't shock me," said Severin Borenstein of the University of
California Energy Institute. "It's a little high, compared to the other
estimates, but there's a lot of uncertainty about what's going to be
available in state and out of state."
The ISO had no comment on the council's projections, but Davis' office said
the forecast is overly pessimistic.
"Their calculations are based on the worst conditions occurring all day,
every day," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio.
He said the council overlooks the expected supplies from new "peaker" power
plants and two Orange County plants that will fire up this summer after five
years in mothballs. The report also underestimates the level of power that
neighboring states will sell to California, he said.
"They assume it's going to be blazing hot in Phoenix, Portland and San
Francisco all on the same day (drastically reducing imports), and that never
happens," Maviglio said.
Davis has tried recently to minimize the impact of blackouts, saying: "We'll
get through the summer without major disruptions. A couple of difficult days,
but no major disruptions."
The council and the ISO are far apart in their assessment of supplies. The
ISO, for instance, predicted that the state will get nearly 2,600 additional
megawatts of power by July from new plants under construction, enough
electricity for nearly 2 million homes. The council said new plants typically
don't operate at full efficiency when they're starting up. Its prediction:
500 megawatts, or enough for only 375,000 homes.
Similarly, the ISO said the drought will curtail hydro supplies by 1,000
megawatts. The council said the shortfall will reach 2,400 megawatts by
August.
And while the ISO figured unexpected plant shutdowns will erase 2,500
megawatts of power, the council predicted the damage will be more than 4,500
megawatts.

Generator, environmental groups strike deal
By Tom Knudson
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 16, 2001)
Days after state regulators gave Duke Energy the go-ahead to expand its Moss
Landing Power Plant near Monterey Bay last fall, documents show four
environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant.
The four signed an agreement not to "participate in any lawsuit (or)
regulatory challenge" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a
financial concession: $1 million from Duke for environmental "monitoring and
research."
Balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been
difficult. But today, as power-starved California scrambles to find and
permit new energy sources, some fear the Moss Landing agreement shows that
money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor
of economic development.
Environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their
concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it,
especially after it was approved by the California Energy Commission and
Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.
So they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement
with Duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on
the marine environment.
Other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach.

Mitigation payments
Duke Energy's efforts to modernize the Moss Landing Power Plant resulted in
mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including:
$7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation to mitigate the plant's use of
seawater.
$425,000 to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over three years to monitor
heated seawater discharge in the ocean.
$1 million to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation over five years to
monitor water quality through a program sponsored by Save Our Shores, the
Center for Marine Conservation, the Friends of the Sea Otter and the Otter
Project.
$100,000 to the Marine Mammal Center to relocate its triage center for
injured animals onto power plant property.
$3.4 million to the Moss Landing Chamber of Commerce over 20 years for
infrastructure improvements in the Moss Landing community.
$100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in
Moss Landing.
$60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed Elkhorn Slough Circle
Trail. If approved, Duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to
maintain the trail.

"It is very disheartening," said Carolyn Nielson, a retired teacher who along
with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider
an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system.
"These environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the
attorneys," said Nielson, who has taken her case to the State Water Resources
Control Board. "We could have been much more successful with their help. But
there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them."
Such criticisms are off-base, according to Warner Chabot, regional director
for the Center for Marine Conservation, a national environmental group that
was among those to sign the deal. He said environmentalists got the best deal
possible in the current energy climate.
"Look at what's happening with power plant approvals in California right
now," said Chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources
on line.
The Moss Landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in
2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy
expansion plan.
No money will go to the four environmental groups -- the Center for Marine
Conservation, along with Save Our Shores, Friends of the Sea Otter and the
Otter Project. It will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000
each, to the Monterey Bay Sanctuary Foundation, a nonprofit organization that
helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research.
Chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. He said
the money will be used to monitor the health of Elkhorn Slough, a
biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to Monterey
Bay.
"Not a dime comes to the Center for Marine Conservation," he said. "Not a
penny comes to me."
Duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been
stirred by a handful of people.
"It's a million dollars worth of water quality studies," said Duke spokesman
Tom Williams. "Our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. It was
designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort
level."
The $1 million agreement signed in November is part of a package of more than
$12 million in Duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in
connection with the plant modernization.
The heftiest award -- $7 million to the Elkhorn Slough Foundation, a
nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to
"mitigate" environmental impacts of the plant.
Formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote "the wise use and
conservation of Elkhorn Slough and surrounding wetlands," its Web site says.
However, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is
inadequate.
"If you want to say, 'Who did Duke roll with a big chunk of money?' I would
say they rolled the California Energy Commission and the Regional Water Board
for the price of mitigation," Chabot said. "The agencies got bought off
cheap. And the environment got taken to the cleaners."
Duke's Williams strongly disagreed. Environmental mitigation "must be based
on science, not on buying anybody off," he said. "That is inappropriate, and
we would not participate in that.
"That suggestion is offensive to us. And it should be offensive to any
environmentalist."
Bob Haussler, head of the Energy Commission's environmental protection
office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. "We are confident it
will improve the slough ecosystem," he said.
Madeline Clark, a local businesswoman and founder of Monterey Parkway -- a
citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the
recipients of Duke's payments a "shopping list" of government agencies,
environmental groups and civic organizations. She was particularly critical
of the $1 million deal with environmental groups.
"You know what bothers me?" Clark said. "Environmental groups get tons of
donations. Their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. If a big
corporation like Duke can come in and buy them off, I have a real problem
with that."
Construction began in November on Duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of
natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the Moss Landing plant, purchased
from PG&E in 1998.
If the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for
more than 30 percent of all new generation in California in 2002.
"This is a big deal," said Williams, the Duke spokesman. "It will be the
largest plant in California. If that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose
the summer of 2002. And that affects not only Duke Energy, but the state of
California."
Opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system,
which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from Moss
Landing Harbor. Such pumping, they say, will degrade Elkhorn Slough. They
argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that recirculate
water.
"Basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the
harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with
much of the marine life cooked and dead," said Steve Shimek, executive
director of the Otter Project.
For Shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by
Duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the
plant's impact on the environment.
"There was no scientific evidence that would literally point to Duke causing
harm to the environment," said Vicki Nichols, executive director of Save Our
Shores. "We felt we didn't have strong standing to sue."
Instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with Duke for financial
payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project.
The process "gave me tremendous pause and great concern," Nichols said. "I
knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong
thing."
She was right.
"As far as I'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy
wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods," said Clark, of the
citizens group.
Her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that Duke Energy
approached Gov. Gray Davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions
if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator.
Chabot, with the Center for Marine Conservation, discouraged any comparison
between the two offers, calling it "grossly unfair and inaccurate."
Regardless of what was intended with the payments, Nielson said they stain
the process. "It is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical," she
said.
Shimek took a different view. "We convinced Duke to spend $1 million toward
monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to
haunt them," he said.
"Did we do the right thing? I have no idea. Did we try our best? Yes, we
did."

Blackouts may create shortage of water: State officials warn that supplies
for drinking and fire hydrants are vulnerable because pumps can fail during
power outages.
By Chris Bowman
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 16, 2001)
State health authorities are notifying public water utilities to secure
emergency water and backup power so fire hydrants won't run dry and drinking
water remains safe during blackouts.
The notice, which is being issued this week to all 8,700 public water systems
in the state, also advises utilities to warn the public that tap water could
turn cloudy or contaminated during a prolonged power outage at the utilities'
well pumps.
The Department of Health Services also suggested alerting consumers to
"immediately discontinue any non-essential water usage" during water outages
or low water pressure.
Clamping down on water use, particularly outdoor irrigation and car washing,
reduces the chances of water systems losing pressure or running dry, state
officials said.
Loss of pressure can introduce bacterial contamination into the
drinking-water supply. Water pipes inevitably leak, and the leakage that
mixes with soil can get sucked back into the system through cracks in the
underground delivery network. The effect, called back-siphonage, is similar
to sipping water through a straw.
As a precaution, the state health notice advises water utilities to increase
monitoring for harmful microbes in areas that lose power.
Changes in water pressure also can churn up sediment settled in pipes,
causing tap water to turn brown or cloudy. Consumers are advised to open hot-
and cold-water faucets when normal water service is restored to flush the
lines until the water turns clear.
The state health advisory comes at the beginning of air-conditioning season
that threatens to drain California's power-short supplies on hot days.
The Association of California Water Agencies is telling its members to
"prepare for multiple, multi-hour power outages: 80-100 hours of power
outages (during the summer) based on average assumptions, up to 1,000 hours
if things get worse."
At issue are the electrical pumps that extract water from wells and keep
supplies flowing at a constant rate through underground networks of municipal
water mains and pipes.
The state Public Utilities Commission has exempted services "necessary to
protect public health and safety" from planned blackouts that power managers
impose to avert a collapse of the state's electricity grid.
The exemption, however, does not apply to water-supply or sewage-treatment
systems, which rely on electric pumps to keep raw wastewater from spilling
out of utility holes.
As a result, water-supply systems are at risk, even for firefighting
agencies, which are exempt from the blackouts.
"Those who provide the necessary water for those services should likewise be
exempted," said the water-utilities association, which is pressing the PUC
for an exemption from blackouts.
PUC officials said that most water utilities have adequate backup generators,
though they have agreed to further consider the utilities' case. Many of the
generators were bought in anticipation of the Y2K computer havoc that largely
failed to materialize.
State health and local utility officials said those generators would prove
critical if the power outages became more frequent and prolonged as expected
this summer.
In its notice to utilities this week, the state health department says it
"encourages all utilities to secure backup power capabilities and to
routinely test their emergency power generating equipment. ... In addition,
storage should be maintained as full as possible."
The advisory also asks utilities to update their "disaster response plans" so
the state can better help utilities in emergencies.
Cliff Sharpe, chief of the health department's drinking-water enforcement for
Northern California, said small community water systems are at greatest risk
because they lack adequate water storage.
But larger systems such as those in the Sacramento area could have delivery
breakdowns if the outages at the well pumps last more than two hours, he
said.
Officials at Citizens Water Resources, which serves 180,000 residents in the
unincorporated areas of metropolitan Sacramento, said it has water-sharing
arrangements with the city of Sacramento and other suppliers in the event of
a water outage.
Having enough power to deliver the water, however, is an open question, said
Herb Niederberger, Citizens operations manager. The utility has several
portable generators and many more on order to install at its wellheads.
Still, officials said they would need the help of residents to make sure the
system gets by. They are asking residents to confine outdoor watering from
midnight to 10 a.m.
"If the blackouts occur during peak hours of energy use and many customers
are using their sprinklers, we'll lose pressure immediately," Niederberger
said.

Dan Walters: Rate raise -- Genuine conflict or tightly scripted political
melodrama?


(Published May 16, 2001)
California's historic -- and terribly flawed -- experiment in the generation,
transmission and pricing of electric energy began as a drive by big
industrial and commercial power customers to reduce their costs.
At the time, California was mired in the worst recession since the Great
Depression, hundreds of thousands of jobs had disappeared and business
executives were complaining about the high costs of operating in the state.
Improving the "business climate" had become an oft-chanted political mantra,
and executives wanted power supplies by competitive bid outside the regulated
utility grid.
The demands of business for "direct access" to competitive power morphed,
thanks to an unfortunate meeting of minds between academic theorists and
vote-hungry politicians, into a broad scheme that was called "deregulation"
but was really a hybrid shaped by powerful interest groups.
Among the many ironies that attach themselves like lamprey eels to the
state's energy crisis is that the big users that wanted to reduce their costs
now are being saddled with sharp spikes in power rates to ease the immense
debts the utilities and the state have amassed. And that irony comes with a
tale of political intrigue.
During late 2000 and early 2001, business leaders, worried that the utilities
were being driven into bankruptcy and power supplies could be interrupted,
repeatedly urged Gov. Gray Davis to allow utility rates to rise. The
Democratic governor rebuffed the pleas for months, agreeing only to a token
and supposedly temporary increase in January. But in April, with the state's
own treasury being hammered by power purchases, Davis relented and agreed to
allow rates to rise by around one-third.
How that came about is still a bit mysterious. Davis acted after the state
Public Utilities Commission, controlled by his appointees and headed by a
former political adviser, unveiled its own rate increase scheme, one heavily
oriented toward imposing most of the burden on business rather than
residential customers. Davis insisted that the PUC had acted on its own,
which produced nothing but guffaws in the Capitol.
PUC President Loretta Lynch plowed ahead with her $5 billion plan, business
executives howled and on Sunday, just as the commission was poised to act,
Davis publicly rejected it. "My plan raises sufficient revenues to deal with
the problem without putting an undue burden on California consumers and
business that might hurt the economy," Davis said. The next day, Lynch
postponed adoption of her plan, saying it was undergoing revisions, and on
Tuesday a new version, somewhat closer to the governor's and less onerous to
business, was unveiled. Davis, it became apparent, had interceded with other
commissioners, including newly appointed Jeff Brown, to lessen the impact on
agriculture and business.
Consumer groups howled about what they characterized as a sellout to
business, arguing that the executives who pressed for deregulation in the
mid-1990s should swallow the rate increases that result from the failure of
the scheme to increase competition and lower power costs. But during a PUC
meeting disrupted by anti-rate increase protesters, the scheme was approved
on a 3-2 vote.
What no one outside Davis' immediate circle knows is whether all of this was
a genuine conflict between the governor and Lynch, the one-time political
strategist he chose to head the PUC, or whether it was a setup to make Davis
appear to be a moderate who saved business from killer utility rates. Davis
is certainly no stranger to the triangulation approach to political issues;
he has often positioned himself as the protector of business, and collected
huge amounts of campaign cash from business groups. And the situation is more
than faintly reminiscent of several incidents that occurred during the Jerry
Brown governorship, when Davis was Brown's chief of staff.
Perhaps it was a genuine conflict, but it certainly has all the earmarks of a
scripted melodrama, with Davis casting himself as the rescuer of business
damsels in distress.

Budget reserve plan stirs up a fight: Gov. Davis backs drawing down the
emergency fund. Others say it could lead to tax hikes or massive cuts.
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 16, 2001)
Budget reserves are for a rainy day, Gov. Gray Davis says -- and it's
starting to rain.
But what if the rain keeps falling and turns into a deluge?
That was one of the questions being asked at the Capitol the day after the
Democratic governor released his revised budget proposal for the fiscal year
that begins July 1.
Among an array of cuts and transfers, Davis proposes to draw down the state's
reserve by $900 million -- from $1.9 billion to $1 billion.
Davis says the reserve was meant to get the state through times such as this,
when a sudden drop in the stock market takes a chunk out of state revenues.
But others, including some Democrats, question whether Davis' plan leaves
enough of a reserve to avoid the need for taxes or massive budget cuts a year
from now.
"The thing we find most egregious is the reduction in surplus," said Assembly
Republican leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks. The Republicans have advocated a
reserve of $4 billion just for the state's future electricity purchases, in
addition to a reserve for other contingencies.
Wall Street seemed to take notice as well. On Tuesday, Moody's, one of the
three leading credit rating agencies, lowered its rating for California's
general obligation bonds from Aa3 to Aa2.
Moody's cited the failure of the Legislature to approve a bill that would
have allowed the immediate sale of bonds to repay the state treasury for
electricity purchases the state has been making since January. The bill,
which required a two-thirds majority, was blocked by Assembly Republicans,
forcing a 90-day wait for the massive bond sale.
But Moody's also cited Davis' budget proposal, which it said "leaves little
cushion for additional bad news." Moody's downgrade follows a similar move
last month by Standard & Poor's and will increase the state's costs of
borrowing.
Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, agreed that the state could find itself in dire
straits next year without a big enough reserve. Peace, chairman of the state
Senate Budget Committee, said a $4 billion reserve "is on the low end of
where we ought to be."
Peace said the state may be headed into a period similar to the budget
disarray of the recession of the early 1990s.
"Having lived through the early '90s experience and having less confidence in
the institutional ability to deal with a crisis environment, I think it would
be wiser to operate on more conservative expectations," he said.
But Ted Gibson, chief economist at the state Department of Finance, said the
early '90s "was a once-in-the-past-century event" that occurred largely
because the state's economy was so dependent on the aerospace industry. High
technology, while suffering a slowdown, "is more diverse in what they do and
where they sell," he said, and can be expected to bounce back.
The state budget increasingly lives and dies with the stock market. The
income tax on stock options and capital gains has grown as a percentage of
general fund revenues from 5.6 percent in the mid-1990s to nearly one-quarter
in the current fiscal year. That number drops to 16 percent in Davis' revised
budget proposal.
But while the sudden drop of the stock market dealt the state a severe blow,
Gibson said, the pain is unlikely to last because stock prices historically
rise.
"I would argue that the big drop in stock market income has to be considered
a one-time affair, and is not going to provide a huge drag," Gibson said.
Gibson and other economists believe the economy will lag the rest of this
year, but gradually improve in 2002 and 2003, avoiding full-blown recession.
Gibson said the administration prepared for the sudden downturn by using
stock market windfalls for one-time expenditures that didn't have to be kept
year after year.
But Republicans say Davis has not done enough in his new proposal to cut
year-to-year spending, relying instead on transfers between accounts and
using the reserve to make ends meet.
"If we do not make good decisions this year, we absolutely are putting
ourselves in some very challenging territory for next year's budget," said
Assemblyman George Runner, R-Lancaster.
Runner questioned Davis' claim that he had kept a lid on spending.
"It's interesting to say that and have government grow by a third in the
three years you've been in office," he said.

Democrats lay out energy plan: Leaders call for caps on wholesale prices and
tax breaks for oil and gas production.
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published May 16, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- House Democrats called for price controls on wholesale
electricity rates and for tax incentives to spur oil and gas production
Tuesday, but emphasized they are not asking Americans to trim their
lifestyles or stop driving gas-guzzling cars to cut energy consumption.
The Democrats' initiative is an effort to take the steam out of the energy
strategy President Bush will unveil Thursday. That proposal is expected to
emphasize opening new areas to oil and gas exploration and building hundreds
of new power plants, but will not include temporary price caps on
electricity. Many in California and the West regard caps as crucial to curb
runaway prices.
California Democrats also expect that the Bush administration will call for
reopening areas off the California coast to oil and gas leasing, and they
will announce today a resolution in opposition to any such proposal.
At a luncheon with reporters, House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt said he
thinks the energy crisis can be solved without "sacrificing" the environment.
"Most people want an energy policy that is consistent with the Clean Air and
Clean Water acts," Gephardt said.
Gephardt criticized the administration for pressing to open the coast of
Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling, saying it would
take too long and produce too little oil to help the current crisis. But
Gephardt said the government should approve tax incentives to hasten
construction of a natural gas pipeline from the North Slope because those
reserves could be a great help for electricity generation.
Gephardt released a 19-page report by the House Democratic Caucus' energy
task force that calls for various tax incentives to promote conservation,
sales of new energy-saving cars and appliances, and home and office
weatherization.
Gephardt said Democrats favor such incentives over mandatory measures to
lower fuel consumption in cars and trucks -- ideas that in the past have been
traditional rallying cries among Democratic representatives.
The task force report, titled "Principles for Energy Prosperity," includes a
cover photograph of a family washing a sport-utility vehicle next to a
wilderness photo of a snow-capped mountain.
Gephardt said he believes that government incentives will work to bring
energy supply and demand into balance without infringing on lifestyle
choices.
"We need to spawn efficiency so that Americans can get what they want -- low
(energy) prices and a clean environment," he said.

Judge names panel in PG&E case
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 16, 2001)
SAN FRANCISCO -- The federal bankruptcy administrator Tuesday defended her
appointment of an unusual committee of ratepayers in the Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. case, saying it's the only way to protect the public.
Ratepayers are entitled to a place at the table, said U.S. Trustee Linda
Ekstrom Stanley, because of "the possibility they will be asked to fund a
plan that pays PG&E's creditors and shareholders."
PG&E has challenged Stanley's legal authority in naming the committee, which
would have broad powers to investigate and negotiate alongside the utility
and its creditors. Judge Dennis Montali will hear oral arguments on the
matter Friday.
"It could be argued the state of California has abandoned ratepayers in the
bankruptcy case," Stanley said in a brief filed with Montali on Tuesday. "As
an alternative to the state's appearance, a committee broadly representative
of virtually all ratepayer constituences is essential to assure the
ratepayers' interests are protected."
PG&E contends that only the state could represent ratepayers. The state has
bowed out, citing its 11th Amendment right of sovereign immunity.
Stanley said the creditors' committee, a standard participant in bankruptcy
proceedings, also cannot speak for consumers in this case because the
creditors may lack a strong interest in pursuing claims against power
generators and the utility's parent company, PG&E Corp.
In asking Montali to disband the committee, PG&E objected particularly to the
inclusion of leaders of Consumers Union and The Utility Reform Network,
groups that sometimes have thwarted PG&E in state regulatory hearings. Others
on the ratepayers' committee represent a diverse mix of organizations,
ranging from the California School Boards Association to the California
Manufacturers & Technology Association.
Two organizations -- the Greenlining Institute and Latino Issues Forum --
have criticized Stanley for not making the committee more inclusive.

SDG&E area spared for now by big rate hikes



Edison, PG&E customers hit hard by state action
By Craig D. Rose
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 16, 2001
In the preview of a movie SDG&E customers don't want to see, the state Public
Utilities Commission walloped customers of California's other major utilities
with electricity rate increases as high as 50 percent yesterday.
The historic increases follow a PUC decision in March to raise electricity
bills for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison customers
by a total $5.2 billion annually.
That decision, however, did not specify how the increase would be allocated.

Yesterday's vote ordered rate increases of up to 37 percent for residential
customers and up to 49.5 percent for business customers. The 3-2 vote drew
howls of protest from demonstrators at the commission's San Francisco
meeting.
Similar increases are expected for San Diego Gas and Electric's 1.2 million
customers in coming months. Public hearings for the SDG&E raises are expected
next month.
Although yesterday's rate increase allocation was stunning, commission
President Loretta Lynch warned of worse increases ahead unless the Federal
Regulatory Energy Commission caps wholesale power costs.
"Unless and until the FERC decides to enforce the law, even these
astronomical new average rates may prove inadequate to cover exorbitant
wholesale electricity prices in the California market," Lynch wrote in the
approved rate increase decision.
The PUC was pressed to raise rates in order to cover California's cost of
purchasing electricity. The state took over purchasing power earlier this
year as utilities moved toward insolvency.
The utilities said that with customer payments frozen under terms of the
state's deregulation law, they were unable to pay the soaring cost of
wholesale power. Critics noted the same utilities transferred billions in
payments to parent companies and shareholders during the first years of
deregulation.
The new increases for the 9 million customers of PG&E and Edison will begin
appearing in June bills but will be retroactive to March, when the rate
adjustment was approved.
Consumer groups said yesterday's vote was delayed by a day because of frantic
lobbying by business interests seeking to shift a greater share of the new
costs onto residential ratepayers.
Mike Florio, senior attorney for The Utility Reform Network, the San
Francisco-based consumer group, calculated that last-minute lobbying by
businesses advocates pushed about $105 million more of the increase onto
residential customers, compared to an earlier version of the rate increase
allocation, which was also written by Lynch.
"This decision shows how desperately we need control over our electric system
and how costly deregulation has become for California," Florio said.
Demonstrators at the PUC session yesterday suggested the commission is
failing to protect the public and should henceforth be called the "Private
Utilities Commission." Others issued calls for seizing power plants.
Commissioner Geoffrey Brown shouted back at protesters that rate increases
were necessary.
Under the rate design approved yesterday, homeowners able to keep electricity
use within 130 percent of the so-called baseline allowance will be spared
increases, as will the lowest-income customers and those with certain medical
conditions. The baseline is a minimum level of electricity, and it varies by
location. The baseline amount, measured in kilowatt-hours, is printed on
electricity bills.
The Office of Ratepayer Advocates within the commission estimates these
exemptions will shield more than 60 percent of all residential consumers.
Others will pay progressively more as their use rises, with the highest
increases of 37 percent for those consuming more than 300 percent of baseline
allowances.
Average industrial rates will increase about 49 percent, while agricultural
rates could rise as much as 20 percent for customers of PG&E and Edison.
The California Manufacturers and Technology Association warned of layoffs if
businesses are forced to pay a disproportionate share. But consumer advocates
said it was large-business interests that pressed for deregulation in the
first place.
"Once again residential and small-business ratepayers, the innocent victims
of deregulation, are being forced to pay for the debacle," said Doug Heller
of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica.
Gov. Gray Davis, who resisted rate increases through the first months of the
power crisis, recently offered a proposal of his own to boost rates.
"While the PUC's revised rate increase made some modest improvements, my plan
represented a more balanced approach," Davis said.
All three commissioners appointed by Davis voted for the increase, while the
two commissioners appointed by former Gov. Pete Wilson were opposed.
Commissioner Richard Bilas, who voted against the increase, said it would
push the state into recession and was a "grave mistake." Henry Duque, the
other dissenter, objected to slapping customers who use more power with
higher percentage rate increases and urged more equal treatment. Both said
the increases would fail to encourage needed conservation.
But Commissioner Carl Wood said the increases were made necessary by FERC's
failure to cap wholesale power prices.
"Every consumer in California is justified in feeling outraged," Wood said.
"They are facing an unlawful price regime for a fundamental necessity. We
continue to look to the federal government to moderate prices."
Bilas, Duque and Lynch were not present in San Francisco for the vote but
participated in the meeting via telephone.






State credit rating takes another hit over energy crisis



Move should add to cost of bonds
By Craig D. Rose and Karen Kucher
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS
May 16, 2001
On the same day that the Federal Reserve lowered interest rates, a Wall
Street rating firm raised the cost of borrowing for California because of
deepening concerns about the electricity crisis.
Moody's Investors Service downgraded California's credit yesterday, pushing
it into a group of 12 states that has the firm's lowest rating.
That is still better than the Standard & Poor's rating for the state, which
last month downgraded California to among the three lowest rated states.
Lenders demand higher interest rates for loans to lower-rated borrowers.
The state treasurer's office was unable yesterday to quantify how much the
downgrades could cost California as it approaches a record $13 billion bond
sale this summer. The bonds are needed to pay for the soaring cost of
electricity.
In other energy developments:
Federal regulators determined this week that no refunds will be ordered for
April's energy bills in California because the state's grid managers did not
declare any Stage 3 emergencies during the month.
In March, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decided refunds would only
apply to charges for power during the most dire shortages, when wholesale
electricity costs are highest. Critics have argued that power prices have
been far from "just and reasonable" during other periods as well.
The agency also has dismissed a request to reconsider the refund amounts it
directed power providers to pay for alleged overcharges made in January.
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric had wanted providers
who allegedly overcharged for wholesale electricity to pay much larger
refunds than federal regulators envisioned. The commission has ordered power
providers to refund $124 million if they can't justify their prices.
FERC said its action is not subject to requests for rehearings at this point,
although such a request may be refiled when the commission issues its formal
order in the case.
A FERC judge said yesterday that a memo in a case he is hearing implies the
natural gas market was abused to drive up California energy costs last year.
The memo "certainly has statements in it that could lead one to believe there
was an abuse" of the gas market, Curtis Wagner, the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission's chief administrative law judge, said in a hearing in Washington.
California regulators have pointed to the memo to accuse Houston-based El
Paso Corp. of using its market power to inflate the price of natural gas sold
in California last year by as much as $3.7 billion.
El Paso Corp. owns a gas marketing company, El Paso Merchant, and one of the
largest pipelines connecting Southwest gas fields to California. The company
has denied the allegations.
Wagner wouldn't release the memo, dated Feb. 14, 2000, and attorneys wouldn't
discuss the contents.
The New York Times has reported that El Paso Merchant said in a Feb. 14,
2000, memo that it would have "more control" of gas markets because of a deal
it made with El Paso Natural Gas that gave it the right to ship 1.2 billion
cubic feet of gas a day on El Paso's pipeline.
Wagner's ruling is expected next month. The full Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission can accept or reject his ruling. The hearing began Monday and
should continue through next week.
Southern California Gas Co., a division of San Diego-based Sempra Energy,
announced yesterday that it plans to add a 32-mile pipeline to its
transmission system to help it keep pace with growing demand.
The additional 6 percent of capacity would allow the company to deliver an
additional 200 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.
Natural gas fuels most of the plants that generate electricity in the state,
and demand increased dramatically as the electricity crisis worsened. The gas
company said the expansion is enough to fuel three 500-megawatt power plants.
The pipeline is expected to cost $40 million and to be completed by the end
of the year. It will extend from a company compressor station in Adelanto to
the Kern-Mojave Pipeline near Kramer Junction. El Paso Corp. and the Williams
Cos. own the Kern-Mojave Pipeline.
The power crunch this summer may be worse than earlier estimates, with
California suffering blackouts on an average of 20 hours a week and possible
power disruptions in the Northeast if hot weather persists, an
industry-sponsored group reported yesterday.
The North American Electric Reliability Council said there may be as many as
260 hours of rolling blackouts in California during the summer months.
The Associated Press contributed to this report.






House Democratic plan calls for power price caps



By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
May 16, 2001
WASHINGTON -- House Democratic leaders yesterday unveiled a plan for coping
with the nation's energy crisis that includes caps on wholesale electricity
prices in California and across the West.
The plan mixes other short-term approaches such as emergency energy funds for
schools with long-range conservation measures that would improve automobile
gas mileage and provide tax credits for energy-efficient homes and cars.
At a news conference outside a Capitol Hill gas station, House Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt and several colleagues scolded the Bush administration
for crafting its own energy plan in secret with energy industry executives.
They also chided President Bush for ignoring his own campaign rhetoric about
pressuring OPEC to lower the price of imported crude oil.
The president tomorrow will travel to Minnesota and Iowa to announce the
administration's energy plan, created by a task force headed by Vice
President Dick Cheney. The administration plan is expected to focus on
developing new-energy resources, but will not include price caps.
Gephardt said, "We do not accept the belief that this administration
apparently has, that we have to drill our way out of this problem, that we
basically have to sacrifice our environment to solve the problem."
In California, Gov. Gray Davis praised the plan from fellow Democrats for
recognizing that the state's "electricity problem is a national issue that
demands immediate federal action."
The governor added, "No comprehensive federal energy policy should exclude
immediate and meaningful wholesale price relief in the West."
Following the Democratic news conference, White House press secretary Ari
Fleischer reiterated the Republican administration's opposition to price
caps.
"Price controls will cause more harm than good in the economy in terms of
people's ability to get energy," Fleischer said. "They will drive supply
down, they will create more demand."
Strategists for both political parties say that the political stakes posed by
the energy crisis could be substantial.
Democrats continued to link the administration with the oil industry, noting
that private energy corporation executives participated in the drafting of
the administration plan. Bush's and Cheney's backgrounds as energy company
executives have also been a point of contention for their critics.
Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass., told reporters that the administration would
produce "a policy written by energy companies who want to use the Bush-Cheney
plan as a Trojan horse to take environmental and health laws off the books."
Democrats also quoted candidate Bush as last year demanding the Clinton
administration pressure the foreign oil cartel "to open (its) spigots."
"Today when crude oil prices stand at $28 a barrel, this White House is
silent," said Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro, D-Conn.
Fleischer shrugged off questions about the influence of American oil
executives on Cheney's task force. He also said the president is engaged in
"quiet" diplomacy with OPEC leaders.
In their plan, the Democrats are demanding a federal crackdown on "price
gouging" by the energy industry and call for limiting wholesale power prices
until March 2003.
They also urge Bush to keep open the option of drawing on the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve to counter future oil market disruptions, a policy the
administration rejected.
The Democratic plan outlines an array of tax credits, including up to $4,000
to encourage energy conservation with more efficient homes and vehicles.
Also proposed are short-term steps to help the poor and elderly with energy
bills, to encourage the use of mass-transit systems and car pools, and to
provide $200 million this year in emergency assistance to Western schools
staggered by energy costs.
For the longer term, the Democrats want more money for a low-income housing
weatherizing program, and efforts to boost domestic energy production.
The latter step calls for increased production on federal lands already open
for drilling and that account for 89 percent of the nation's proven oil and
gas reserves.
The proposals include tax incentives for domestic production of crude oil,
natural gas and "clean" coal.
The plan also calls for expedited pipeline construction, bolstered safety at
nuclear power plants, improved electricity transmission grids, expanded
refining capacity and encourages the development of renewable energy sources.
Fleischer noted that the Democrats had offered "some areas of overlapping
commonality" with the administration's plan.
However, Democrats spotlighted their opposition to the administration's call
for drilling in a small portion of Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
and Bush's decision not to clamp down on carbon dioxide emissions from power
plants as he had promised during the campaign.
"I would note that their idea seems to be to drill, to dig and to detonate
our way out of this mess, and to throw away environmental protections," said
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.







Southern California Gas plans pipeline expansion



By Seth Hettena
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 15, 2001
SAN DIEGO ) Southern California Gas Co., the nation's largest gas utility,
announced plans Tuesday for a $40 million expansion to keep pace with the
state's growing demand for electricity and ease the strains on its
transmission system.
Analysts say California's electricity crisis is threatening to exhaust the
state's supplies of natural gas, which fuels most electric generating plants.
A drought in the Pacific Northwest has cut hydroelectric power supplies,
putting pressure on natural gas-fired plants to make up the shortfall.
Southern California Gas, a unit of San Diego-based Sempra Energy, will add
capacity for enough gas to power three 500-megawatt power plants that could
provide enough electricity for 1.5 million homes. The expansion, combined
with $15 million in improvements to the transmission system announced in
March, will boost SoCal Gas' capacity by 11 percent.
Both projects are expected to be completed by the end of the year.
Two-thirds of SoCal Gas' natural gas is sold to power plants and industrial
users and demand from power plants has pushed the utilization of the
company's transmission system to 95 percent, up from historic levels of about
75 percent.
While Southern California Gas said it expects to meet its obligations to its
5 million residential and small business meters this winter, company
spokeswoman Denise King said the expansion "gives a little extra margin, a
little space on our system."
"This is kind of an assurance that we'll be able to provide reliable service
to all of our customers as we have in the past," she said.
But Mark Bernstein, an energy analyst with RAND Corp., a think-tank in Santa
Monica, said the expansion is "an insurance policy they'll cash in on."
"It's to make sure we don't have a gas crisis like we have an electric
crisis," he said.
"If you plan for the average they'll be just fine," Bernstein said. "But
there could be situations weather-wise or if things get worse on the electric
side, where they could begin to have supply problems."
Southern California Gas will build a 32-mile pipeline from near the town of
Victorville north through the Mojave Desert to the large Kern-Mojave
pipeline, which is owned by Williams Co. and El Paso Corp.
State regulators have alleged that the El Paso Corp., which controls more
than 40 percent of the natural gas capacity entering California, conspired to
drive up prices by curtailing supply. The cost of wholesale gas on the spot
market at the California border rose to as much as $14 per thousand cubic
feet, nearly three times the price elsewhere.
The Houston-based company blames the high prices on demand exceeding supply.
The accusations are the subject of hearings this week before the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission.
King declined to address the allegations against El Paso.
"Our focus is to encourage the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to put
temporary caps on natural gas coming across the interstate pipeline to help
in the solution toward natural gas prices," she said.






Cheney's energy plan will offer no quick fixes on gasoline prices



By Sandra Sobieraj
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 15, 2001
WASHINGTON ) The energy plan that Vice President Dick Cheney hands off to
President Bush this week will offer no immediate relief for high gasoline
prices and no immediate answers to two of the politically trickiest issues
that Cheney's task force looked at ) nuclear waste and gas mileage standards.
In an interview with The Associated Press three days before the president
unveils his national energy strategy, Cheney did signal some distaste for
tightening gas mileage requirements, referring to them generally as a
"command-and-control approach."
The vice president, whose task force report already has been printed, said
Monday that the Transportation Department will be ordered to study so-called
corporate average fuel economy ) or CAFE standards ) after the National
Academy of Sciences releases its findings on the CAFE standards in July.
The standards have, to the automobile industry's satisfaction, remained
unchanged since 1975 despite the proliferation of gas-guzzling sport utility
vehicles, vans and pickup trucks.
Acknowledging that such standards "have made a contribution in the past" by
promoting fuel-efficient vehicles, Cheney added:
"Whether or not there are changes that are warranted, whether or not CAFE
standards or the command-and-control approach is the right way to go in all
of that ) we're going to look to the Department of Transportation for some
guidance."
The product of three months of Cabinet-level study and dozens of
consultations with interest groups, Cheney's energy recommendations will
center on increasing the nation's energy supplies though expanded nuclear
power, increased domestic oil drilling and more efficient movement of energy,
including electricity, natural gas and petroleum.
Bush, armed with polls showing conservation is popular, also will discuss
alternative energy sources when he releases the report Thursday during a trip
to Minnesota and Iowa.
On Tuesday, Cheney previewed the plan for advocates f
