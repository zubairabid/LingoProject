Tana,  Stephanie and I just confirmed that I still do not have full access to
lotus notes.  I cannot, for example, edit any legal notes re: our
brokerage/trading agreements.  Stephanie suggested that I ask you for
guidance.


Stephanie, as per our discussion, in the meantime can you put the following
updates in Lotus notes:

ITG POSIT:   Cheryl sent document for execution on 2/8.  Sheila Glover
suggested changes to pricing schedule.  2/9 Cheryl called counsel regarding
need to edit.

WSI:  2/9 Cheryl talked to John Bosse and recommended some material changes.
Bosse is sending a forecast agreeemtn today so that some terms therein can be
implemented into a final draft.  Will call on Monday to follow up.

Bear Sterns InterConnect:  2/9 Cheryl sent an email message to Christine
Durlin and she responded.  We are in the process of discussing problematic
issues re: arbitration and indemnification.  Bear Sterns apologized for the
delay -- they admitted to losing the paperwork and changing personnel who
were handling the agreement.  Cheryl and Christine plan to look into the
issues and talk Monday or Tuesday.

Robertson Stephens:   2/9 Cheryl called Alberto Delgadillo again asking for
the status on their legal review.
2/5: Samantha called -- they said they never got the comments that our
outside counsel sent on 1/5 so Samantha resent.

JP Morgan: 2/9 & 2/1 Cheryl left message for status of their review of our
comments.
