Thanks for verifying the flow conditions out of WT-1, it appears we might have 35 mmcfd extra capacity above the 550 mmcfd WT-1 discharge capacity, using your assumptions.  Can you please check the following flow scenario using the stated FT conditions:

1.	EPFS flowing 85 mmcfd into the high discharge of WT-1.
2.	Crawford, Atoka, Maljamar , Zia and WT-2 bypassed gas which totals 500 mmcfd.

Can Sta 9 still handle the pressure, and what is the breakdown of volumes at each of the points on the suction side of WT-1?
I show FT volumes of about 500 mmcf on the discharge of WT-1 in Nov & Dec of 02.  I need to know if the 85 mmcfd at EPFS Eddy can be dedicated to the expansion receipts.  I think that there is some Crawford gas available in excess of their 40 mmcfd of current firm, that can be dedicated to the expansion receipts, but I need to know that volume.  I will get with you to figure out the point volumes this morning sometime.

Morgan would like to have a brief meeting to discuss these options sometime this afternoon.  Let me know what I can do to assist in your analysis.

Thanks PT  3-0667
