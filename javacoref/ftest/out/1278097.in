Folks-
Just a reminder about the California Energy Solutions Group Annual Retreat.
We are 2 weeks away and need everyone who plans to attend to send in their
registration and book their hotel rooms NOW!!!! Also, we have to submit the
final numbers for golf TODAY by close of business and only have 5
confirmed -- if there are others who want to golf please let me know ASAP so
that I do not give up the spots. We are diligently working away at the
agenda and hope to have it finalized by the end of the week so that we can
send it out to you all.

As always, please do not hesitate to call or email with any questions or to
pass this on to others who might find it of interest. I have attached the
registration forms again for your convenience.

Thanks,
Delaney
