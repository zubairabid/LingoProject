All of you have expressed an interest in having a collateral annex to use
with the EEI Master Contract.  A small group began working on an annex last
winter.  Bill McCoy from Morgan Stanley circulated a "conceptual" draft which
was commented on by a few companies.  Due to the intervening California
market crisis, the group did not undertake further work.  After our credit
workshop in Atlanta in March, many of you have asked to bring the working
group together in order to reach closure on the annex.    As a starting,
point I've attached Bill McCoy's draft and the comments circulated to date.
I suggest that we develop a strawman from these documents that would serve as
the basis for a consensus document adopted at a drafting meeting during the
summer.  Before that meeting we could collaborate via email and conference
calls.  Reliant has agreed to host a meeting in July which would coincide
with a meeting  of the EEI contract drafting committee.  No specific date has
been set, but many in the drafting committee are leaning towards meeting
after mid-July.     Please use the attached calendar to show dates you would
be unavailable in July so we can set a date.  Please fax this to Patricia
Young at 202-508-5673 or email to pyoung@eei.org

So, we are looking for people who are willing to roll up their sleeves and
get the job done.  We need the following to do this efficiently:  (1) someone
to chair the group; (2) people willing to draft language; (3) someone to act
as "scribe" to maintain the working draft and incorporate comments; and (4)
input on what is drafted.  I propose holding a conference call next Friday to
select a chair, set a schedule, and make assignments.  Please let me know
your thoughts on this process.
