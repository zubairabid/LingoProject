Emergency Site Relocation
The emergency site relocation for firms affected by the WTC bombing is going well on the fixed income and commodities trading side. Trading is being relocated largely to New Jersey and Connecticut. There was very significant contingency planning here, and it is being put to good use. The futures and equities markets are not moving as quickly due to telecommunications problems. Bond trading, which will resume in Tokyo tonight (as reported in the press), means that the cash market in the US should start to come back tomorrow.
