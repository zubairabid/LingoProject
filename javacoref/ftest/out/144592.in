I have received the production and pricing information for the month of
June.  Crescendo should expect to receive about $180,000 for their
production.  This is net transport and compression charges.  I have several
questions, which I have put calls into the appropriate Enogex/OG&E person.  I
am uncertain as to when the wire will be received.  Attached is a spreadsheet
providing you with more information.  Please let me know if you would like to
receive this email each month, and also, if you would like a hard copy of the
information I have received - production by wellhead.  I will be forwarding
this to David Defrance [Crescendo accounting person].

This gas is termed up thru September.

price is questar less .01, per kirk harbert, it s/b questar plus .01 [he said
they would waive the 2 cent marketing fee].

month.  what was the imbal as of 6/01?
