Group,
A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW counterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer members in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost never buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2. We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with regards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling the CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you have questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at the start of September.
