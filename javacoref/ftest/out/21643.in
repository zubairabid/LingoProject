On September 19th Dr. Bill Thies, vice president of medical and scientific
affairs for the national Alzheimer's Association, will be in Houston to
provide an update on some of the new and successful research underway for
Alzheimer's disease.  He'll also be meeting with local reseachers to learn
what they're doing in order to support and potentially fund their work.
Since all of you have been such great supporters of our efforts to raise
funds for this very cause, Phil and I are hosting a breakfast so you can hear
firsthand how your money is being spent.  No pledge cards will be handed out
at the door--just juice, coffee and maybe a bagel.  Please join us to hear an
update from Dr. Thies on September  19 from 7:00 to 8:00 a.m. in the Enron
Building, Room 49C1.  Please RSVP to Adriana Wynn at X55176.
