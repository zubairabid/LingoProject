The conversation was very positive (Glynn did not know anything about it at
first, but, looked into it and called Ken back Friday evening).  Glynn said
they were including the amount owed in their negotiations over the price for
the transmission assets and said they intended to pay all of their debts,
including this one, as soon as they get paid.  He said that this weekk would
be focussed on finalizing a deal for SCE given the threat of bankruptcy; the
discussions would then turn to PG&E.
