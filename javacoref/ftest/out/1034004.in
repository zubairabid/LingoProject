Things are changing.
This issue is still under discussion and the new proposed measures allow consumers to sell to generators, distributors and traders.
If this happens, their price is going to raise to MAE price (or close to). The main issue now is "Is MAE goig to start settling?".
I'll keep informing you guys.
