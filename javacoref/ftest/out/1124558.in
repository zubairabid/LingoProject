FYI--Didn't see you names on the distribution below.  These are Lynn's notes from the conference call we had with SoCalGas yesterday.  Overall it appears to have a positive impact on TW.  The meeting scheduled for next week is with their customers.  They are having conf. calls such as the one we had yesterday with each of the interstate pipelines.  As additional information becomes available I'll pass it on.  gh
