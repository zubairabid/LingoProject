ISS is unavailable today.  The warmer weather is resulting in our LDC injecting at their maximum level.

IT is available and the numbers from this morning show $.06 spread between Niagara and points "close"  to Leidy.  I'm using Dominion Appl.  Let's see what happens during the morning.  I have capacity up to 100,000.

IAS has a meager $.025 spread over the winter:(.

Is everyone else as bearish on prices as Salomon Smith Barney?
