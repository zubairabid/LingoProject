Yes. The opportunities are huge, if regulations allows regulated customers to sell power. Ferro alloy and Silicon represents around 1000MW and including Aluminum and Soda around 2000MW. Mateus is talking to Valesul and, I'm talking to Alcan for their generated power, but they have shown interest to sell purchased power. I've been talking (with Fred) also to ferro-alloy and silicon producers that are interested as well.
