Dear Mike,
Thanks for your insight.  In the past few months we have established a
detailed approach to doorstep which includes interfacing with BRM.  Through
my calls the past week, I've been trying to update you so we can determine
how best to coordinate the Enron Europe work, as well as get an understanding
of what resources you can supply for this global initiative.
My next step is to contact some of the people on the list you gave me to
determine their skill set and what locations/commodities they'd be best to
work on.
I'll send you an updated schedule once I've finalized this.
Thanks
