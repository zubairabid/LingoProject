Folks,

Wanted to pass along a little tidbit that Jean Michaud heard today.  Jean was told that the seller financing provided by Noranda in connection with their sale of Scottsboro Aluminum to MAP was extended this past June, around the same time we were closing our tolling option.  This is further indication that our ctpties withheld information re: Scottsboro's actual financial condition.
