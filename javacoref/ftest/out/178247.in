I'm on vacation next week, but would be happy to get together first thing the
following week to discuss.

Also, in response to a voicemail that I received, wanted to let folks know
that the CPUC did not hold gas hearings today. The legislature is, however,
holding hearings, taking a "comprehensive view" of the industry (i.e.,
focusing on specific allegations of pipeline capacity "price gouging").  They
held their first hearing today, but it got cut short due to activities
underway in the Legislature.  I believe that, prior to cutting the hearing
short, the Legislature only made it through two panels of customers, who told
stories of skyrocketing bills and associated hardship.

One panel participant (Anastacio Andrade of Sunrise Mushrooms, I believe)
waived an EES bill and described how it tripled between November and
December.  I have a feeling that the Legislature's actions may be prompting
the PUC to appear that it's doing something.  I'll report more on the
Legislative hearings as they occur.

Best,
Jeff
