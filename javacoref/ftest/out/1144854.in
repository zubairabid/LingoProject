Hello Everyone,

A few events will be happening next week and I wanted to remind everyone about them.

On Tuesday December 4, The BEAR Guild will be having an Open House coffee in the Glass Room from 9-11.  It is an opportunity for people to come and see BEAR Necessities and learn more about our program.

On Tuesday December 4, Bank One is having a Media Day for their Spirit of Christmas Program.  It is in the Bank One Lobby from 11:00 - 1:00 at 910 Travis.  It would be wonderful if some of the Board Members could attend.

Hopefully, you all received your BEAR newsletter.

If you should have any questions, please call me at 713-940-3087.

Lori
