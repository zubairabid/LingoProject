a federal judge in the United States ruled that thousands of former
Filipino, Chinese, and Korean prisoners of war who claim that they were used
as slave labour by Japanese companies during World War II may not sue for
damages in U.S. courts. U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that
the Treaty of Peace signed by the United States and a multitude of other
nations bars so-called slave labourers from seeking damages from Japanese
companies for work that may have been tantamount to slave labour. The court
decided that allowing the suits to carry on would "unsettle half a century

similar suits. See " Judge

2001, a California state court judge refused to dismiss a lawsuit against a
Japanese company brought by a man who alleged he was forced into slave
labour during World War II. In attempting to dismiss the lawsuit, the
defendants asserted that the Japanese Government made accords to deal with
the slave labour claims, but the judge rejected this argument, stating that
"no prior decision of any branch has approved of the defendant's actions,"
and no treaty ratified by the U.S. addressed the claims of the plaintiff.
There are currently over two dozen cases alleging wartime slave labour in
U.S. state courts, leading many to speculate that this decision may spur

DE - SHAREHOLDERS IN NAZI POISON GAS MAKER BLOCK DISSOLUTION TO PAY SLAVE
LABOURERS: On September 18, 2001, shareholders of a German chemical company
that manufactured poison gas for use in Nazi death camps stopped attempts to
dissolve the company to make payments for World War II slave labourers. The
board of IG Farben refused to admit a motion that would have sold the assets
with an estimated worth of US$10 million to pay for claims by former slave
labourers. IG Farber has been attempting to settle a number of lawsuits
involving these claims, but it has refused to contribute to a US$4.6 billion
national compensation fund. See " Shareholders

DE - THREAT OF SICK LEAVE JUSTIFIES TERMINATION FOR CAUSE: The Labour Court
of Cologne recently ruled that an employee gives reason for a termination
for cause if he threatens the employer that he will go on sick leave even
though he is not ill. During a dispute with his superior, the employee in
the case at issue announced that he would go on sick leave for at least
three months. The following day he submitted a medical certificate, stating
he had a tumor on his hand. The tumor, however, would not necessarily have
kept the employee from working. The court therefore held that the employee's
behaviour was clearly an attempt to "punish" the employer and that it
therefore would justify a termination for cause. See " Threat Of

an employee who is on long-term sick leave must accept a constructive
dismissal, even if this implies a reduction of his or her salary. Due to eye
problems, the employee could not work as driver any more and was on sick
leave for more than one year. Therefore, the employer gave constructive
dismissal to him and assigned him a new job as warehouseman, where the
employee was paid less salary then before. The Labour Court of Frankfurt
ruled that the employee had to accept the new job even though his new salary
was lower than his previous salary. See " Constructive

DE - EMPLOYER CANNOT CONTEST LABOUR AUTHORITY'S DECISION REGARDING DISABLITY
STATUS: The District Social Court in Rhineland-Palatine recently ruled that

disability status of an employee. Even though the employee is given special
rights by such a decision, such as extended vacation claims and special
termination protection, the employer must not contest the decision if it
feels it was wrong. According to the District Social Court, the applicable
disability law is meant to protect employees only but does not give any

DE - SHOP AGREEMENTS DO NOT ALLWAYS SUPERSEDE EXPIRED COLLECTIVE BARGAINING
AGREEMENTS: The German Federal Labour Court recently ruled on that in case
of a transfer of business, shop agreements applicable to the buyer's company
do not necessarily supersede other collective regulations applicable to the
employees of the acquired company. In the respective case, the buyer
acquired a company that was previously bound by a collective bargaining
agreement that provided for annual extra payments. The buyer was not a
member of the respective employers' association and therefore not bound by
the respective collective bargaining agreement. The court ruled, however,
the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement became part of the
individual employment contracts of the employees in accordance with the
German Civil Code. Since the acquired company was located in another city
than the buyer's company, provisions of the collective bargaining agreement
were also not superseded by shop agreements applicable to the buyer's
company. According to the Court, these shop agreements are applicable only
to the employees of the respective plant location but not to the employee of
the acquired company. See " Transfer  <http://bundesarbeitsgericht.de/> of

recently indicated that it remains confident of the future and that
"evolution perspectives for 2002 remain positive." "Growth should be higher

the Ministry of Employment, France is affected by "the slow-down of economic
activity," even if it is "less affected than its European partners."

CO - UNION ACTIVISTS CLAIM THAT U.S. FUELS COLOMBIA'S WAR AGAINST UNION: On
September 15, 2001, labor activists issued a report that alleged that U.S.
aid to the Colombian armed forces has indirectly supported a rash of
violence against the labour movement in Colombia. The report states that
Colombia is the third largest recipient of foreign aid from the U.S., and
claims that US$1 billion in almost pure military assistance has been
directed against the "critics of the Colombian social and economic order."
The report also asserts that more unionists are killed in Colombia than
anywhere else in the world. See " Unionists

September 17, 2001, President Bush announced plans to call up 35,000

aware of the provisions of The Uniformed Services Employment and

), a federal law that prohibits discrimination against persons because of
their service in the Armed Forces, the Army National Guard, the Air National
Guard, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and other
categories of persons designated by the President in time of war or national
emergency. USERRA prohibits an employer from denying any benefit of
employment on the basis of an individual's membership, application for
membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation
for service in the uniformed services. USERRA also protects the rights of
