To all,

For first and second quarter, the following margin and EBIT was recognized from the Pluto/MEGS project:

1. First Quarter		Margin: $3.027 MM	EBIT: $ 1.328 MM
2. Second Quarter	Margin:	$1.348 MM	EBIT: $   .707 MM

In addition, Duke Energy Field Services (Stephen Noe) has contacted Kevin Miller and is interested in acquiring this asset. DEFS has signed a C.A. and Kevin and Jesus Melendrez are preparing appropriate documents for their valuation.

Although these earning were initially recognized by Production Offshore, with its dissolution, the Pluto/MEGS EBIT currently resides in Upstream Products Executive.
