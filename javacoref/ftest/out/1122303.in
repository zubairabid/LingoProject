We are still looking for a couple of parents to attend the  Blue Barn field trip on Tuesday, October 16.  The field trip will take up  the entire school day - from 8:00 a.m. until carpool time.  Because we had  late notice about this field trip, some of the parents who originally signed up  to go cannot attend.  It is my understanding that parents drive their own  cars, while students take school busses.  I have been told that Blue Barn  is approximately 1 hour away from the school.

If there is any way that you or your spouse can attend,  please email me at schick1@earthlink.net  or call me at  713-626-9726 as soon as possible.  Thank you - have a great  weekend!
