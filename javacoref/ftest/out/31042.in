Thanks Jeff,  I appreciate all of your help.
On the regulatory front, Cinergy will be joining the Midwest ISO and I have been working with Mike Roan on these issues.  Kerry Stroup has also been brought in recently to focus on Day One issues while Mike is going to focus on Day Two issues.  I would recomend we pull Mike in on this meeting since Kerry is in our Dublin office and is just getting up to speed on MISO activities.
Also, I have had a number of conversations with the CG&E transmission group and can give everyone an overview of their operational procedures.
