Steve knows I am pissed about this and in our Arcos meeting I brought up the
same point raised by Kay below.  Steve claims that the no cap on gov.
violations was rejected some time ago by GE mana. when Barnas presented to
them an update of the "end world hunger".  Steve also thinks that they had
told us previously about this change.  ( Is this true???)  I told him it was
news to me and that I would have thought that if true, then GE would have (a)
highlighted the changes on the draft contract and/or (b) added it to the list
of outstanding issues.
When asked to explain the rationale for changing their position on this
issue, Steve was unable to give an answer other than to say GE mana. had said
that they needed to cap their liability at the contract price for gov.
violations although they thought GE could live with no cap on FCPA violations.
