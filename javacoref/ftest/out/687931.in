There are several items worth noting regarding the ERCOT's methodology:
Regulation Reserve Requirements (RGRS).  ERCOT has determined that 600 MW of
Reg up and down will be adequate for 95% of the hours during the year, if
historic patterns hold and if balancing energy is deployed properly.  During
what ERCOT considers to be "high stress" periods, they will increase their
normal RGRS requirement by a multiple of 2-3.  The initial start-up of the
single control area will  be considered "high stress" and ERCOT will purchase
2-3 what is necessary to cover the inexperience of the operators.  This will
be the practice until ERCOT is comfortable with the single control area (or
until market participants complain about the high cost of A/S).  The high
stress option will remain available for the first year of operations.
Non-Spinning Reserve Requirements (NSRS).  ERCOT proposes to a methodology of
purchasing NSRS only when projected risk of insufficiency is higher than
normal, or large amounts of spinning reserve are not projected to be
available online based on resource plans..  This boils down to where the
temperature is projected to be greater than 92 degrees, less than 32 degrees
Fahrenheit or uncertain and when spinning reserves less than 4600 MW are
projected.  Here is the process:
1. Review the weather forecast for the next day and see if it differs
significantly from the current day.
2. If the next day forecast is &similar8 to the current day forecast, and
the current day forecast high temperature is <92, and the current    day low
temperature is greater than 32 degrees, and the current day generation plan
shows >4600 MW of spinning reserve online    all day long, and the current
month is not April, May, or October, THEN no NSRS is considered to be
required all day for the next    day.
3. Else: Purchase NSRS using the following:
If the current month is April, May or October, then purchase NSRS in
amounts equal to the largest unit online for the hours     projected within
80% of peak hour.
If today,s and tomorrow,s ERCOT high temperature is projected above 92
degrees, then purchase NSRS in amounts equal to the    largest unit online
for the hours projected warmer than 92 degrees.
If tomorrow,s low temperature forecast is projected below 30 degrees,
then purchase NSRS in amounts equal to the largest unit    online for the
projected morning load pickup hours and hours projected within 80% of peak
hour.
Purchase amounts of NSRS equal to the largest unit online for hours in
which the Day Ahead operator estimates spinning reserves    online will drop
lower than 4600 MW.
Replacement Reserve Requirements (RPRS).  The requirement will be set at the
amount of RPRS required to resolve supply inadequacy, CSC, and OC (local)
congestion simultaneously.  There will be procurement of RPRS if the resource
plans indicate capacity inadequacy based on the QSE scheduled load  with the
ERCOT projected load.  If the ERCOT projected load is greater than the QSE
scheduled load and capacity available in the resource plan does not cover the
difference, then there is a capacity inadequacy problem.  If the CSC flows
based on the QSE schedules are greater than the limits, then the CSC problems
are recorded.  Then a transmission contingency analysis will be run to
identify OC constraints.  If the flows are greater than the limits, the OC
flow values are recorded.  When there are insufficient RPRS bids for ERCOT to
resolve its reliability and security concerns, ERCOT may choose to request
OOM capacity or to use RMR units.  ERCOT will use the scheduling pricing
dispatch (SPD) to determine which OOM and RMR units should be selected and
when to discontinue OOM/RMR service.
Balancing Energy Requirement.  ERCOT's goal for balancing energy is (1) to
use BES so that regulation service in either direction is not depleted, (2)
to minimize net energy in regulation, and (3) to provide frequency control
when frequency is high, especially during minimum load intervals.  ERCOT will
use a two-step approach to calculate balancing energy service needs.  Step
one will be to clear the balancing energy service market resolving
load-generation balances and Zonal congestion (local congestion is ignored).
Step two is to determine the balance energy service needs to resolve local
congestion as well as generation-load balance and zonal congestion.   The
desired result of step two is to minimize the cost of local congestion which
will be an uplift to the market.
Balancing Energy Down Bid Percentage Requirement.  This will be used for
congestion management and frequency control (to correct for high frequency).
ERCOT will evaluate the export amount of each congestion management zone and
transmission transfer capability between CM Zones.  If the export amount is
greater than the calculated transfer capability of a CM Zone, then the
difference between these two values is the potential congested MW, or the
total MW of DES Down bids needed for clearing Zonal Congestion.  Also
sufficient down bid percentage requirement will be determined by ERCOT.
Market rules dictate that by 0600 of the day ahead QSEs will be notified of
this percentage requirement for BES down bids by Congestion Zone.
Responsive Reserve Requirement (RRS).  The RRS requirement is set at 2300 MW
for all hours under normal conditions.  Interruptible responsive reserve
cannot exceed 25% of the QSE total requirement.
For the initial start-up period of the market, ERCOT will have the tendency
to over buy ancillary services while the are "adjusting" to the single
control area.
