Thanks Terri, some quick comments on the term sheet, and suggestions on due diligence items your team should review while we are waiting to hear a response from the customer.  FYI - Heather Kroll has been working through many of these issues as well on some Southeast transactions and may be a good source of information.
Comments on term sheet
ISO/RTO Effect, small typo:  EPMI shall have the right, but [not] the obligation
Conditions [Precedent]:  Forming a control area is news to me, how did we come to this conclusion?  I understand it to be very expensive.
Due Diligence Items:
Will IP sell EPMI schedules 3-6 of their current OATT separate from the other cost components of this tariff?
Are there any market offers for schedules 3, 5 & 6 from existing merchant generators?
What are the logistical requirements to serve this type of load in Illinois.  Internal contacts for some of the components are: Meters-Rick Broussard, Daily Imbalance Management-Services Group, Expected RTO format-Regulatory.
Additionally, we should verify wheeling costs, and treatment of losses from IP border to SWECI system (our models assumed that we provide load grossed up for losses).
