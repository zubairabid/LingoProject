Gentleman,
Thanks for your assistance and support at the recent TFA board meeting.

In the good news department we have several items....

1.	Houston Endowment commited $200,000 payable in two installments
(June 2001 and June 2002).  Thanks to Jack Trotter for asisting with this
grant request.

2.	Letters are going out to corporate leaders following the recent
breakfast.  We thank Ken Lay, John Duncan, Scott Yeager and Jack Clark for
their assistance on the letter.  We especially thank John Duncan and Jack
Trotter for their assistance with suggested contribution amounts.
Contributions will go to support TFA activities in Houston and beyond.

3.	I was in Colorado last week.  We have successfully negotiated the
support of the Jared Polis Foundation for Technology For All-Colorado.
Jared Polis  has made a three year commitment totaling approximately
$750,000 to support TFA-Colorado as a  project o the Foundation. Mr. Polis
is a 29 year old entrepreneur who sold the online business of Blue Mountain
cards to Hallmark for around $800 million.  He is very interested in
education and technology issues and has essentially agreed to fund the work
of TFA-Colorado for at least three years as additional community support is
developed.  We will "co-brand" the web presence of TFA-Colorado with the
Foundation.

THANKS TO EACH OF YOU....

Will
