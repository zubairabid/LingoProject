Attached is an update of what has been complete and what is outstanding.  We
are missing 4 valuations; Amerada Hess, LSI Preferred (We have the warrants),
Merlin Credit Derivative and Chewco SLP.  Of the 31 privates plus Chewco SLP,
we have proposal sheets and confirms for only 7.  The publics have all been
received.
We need to have the valuations, proposal sheets and confirms to Talon by
Wednesday for their lawyers to review.  The deadline is still to have
everything completed by this week.
Please call me if you have any questions.
