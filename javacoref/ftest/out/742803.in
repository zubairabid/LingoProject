Andy. I do not know who Gordon is nor his connections with the rest of the ESC group so I cannot gage the effect of your proposed e-mail to him. This is what I know:
The BOT wanted some immediate action, the NERC staff was under pressure (criticism) at the meeting. The inclusion of the ESC mention was an attempt to latch-on to some positive development. NERC wanted to be linked with it and not be left out, (where this effort may be re-directed to EISB for continuation)  Some stakeholders smelled a rat, and wanted to link NERC's link to this effort to a new committee voting structure; therefore  items 7, 8, and 9 were modified to reflect these comments,  and this is how the resolution came out below (see below).
The next step will be at FERC to decide how the OASIS 2 work is to continue and under whose leadership. It may not be under the existing ESC group or a reformulation of it.
Next week (Tuesday)  I would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to ESPA

Resolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards
(Board Agenda Item 20)
WHEREAS, Reliability standards developed by NERC, relying on the expertise of industry experts, have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over 30 years; and
WHEREAS, With the opening of the transmission systems, the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities, and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers, NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair, open, balanced and inclusive; and
WHEREAS, To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large RTOs, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids, it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards; and
WHEREAS, NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards, including spearheading the OASIS "What" and "How" working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC), which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase 2); and
WHEREAS, the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERC's future Organization Standards will be based; and
WHEREAS, NERC is recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America, and
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards; and
WHEREAS, the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards;
BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that NERC:
1.	Take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards through a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process, and to file such standards with FERC and appropriate government agencies in Canada.
2.	Actively solicit cooperation, collaboration, and support from Canadian and U.S. government entities to establish NERC as the single organization in North America for the development of reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards.
3.	Take immediate action to adopt and implement the six Initial Recommendations of the Standing Committee Representation Task Force contained in Board Agenda Item 22.
4.	Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, and on a course of action to institute such capabilities.
5.	Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations.
6.	Build on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process.
7.	Recommend that FERC use the ESC report, which has already been submitted to FERC, as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards.
8.	Urge FERC to make use of the ESC, which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board, for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards, including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services.
9.	Commit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework.
