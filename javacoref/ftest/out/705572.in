Shudeish with the state of Arizona just phoned and said that he and Probaht
Baragava are available to meet with us on Thursday at 2:00 pm.  This is the
only time and day of this week that they will be able to see us.  I asked
about whether Kathy OConnell and Nancy Wrona would be able to attend this
meeting and he stated that their calendars were full this week and would not
attend.   He will need to know by tomorrow whether to book this meeting and
who will be attending.  Sarah had mentioned that Thrusday was not a good day
for her.  Should we schedule this and if so, who will be attending in Sarah's
place?
