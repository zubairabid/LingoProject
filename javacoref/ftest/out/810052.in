When CES runs out of transport and takes more than their "their first of the
month" volume on any given day, the price is GD App + $.06 + FT variable
cost.  This works real well with Scott's $.05 IT discount.

What I don't know about is the Aristech capacity, does that belong to CES or
ENA for May?  I apologize upfront if someone has already responded.
