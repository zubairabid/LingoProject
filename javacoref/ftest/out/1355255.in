All -

As you know, our UT MBA Associate candidates will be attending their Super Saturday the weekend of November 2 and 3. There are several opportunities for you to volunteer and help recruit these candidates.  We will host a dinner at La Columbe D'or Friday, November 2 (managers and above are still needed), and an informal dinner is scheduled for Saturday, November 3 at Teala's (associates are still needed).  Interviewers (manager level and above) are always in demand.  If you are interested in volunteering, please e-mail Dolores Muzzy at:  dolores.muzzy@enron.com.

Thanks!
