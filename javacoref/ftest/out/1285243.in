As we expected, people are finding that the placement of people is not meeting all their needs.  I plan to meet with Presto, Duran and Arnold's folks next Tuesday, Nov 27 to review potential changes.  I will prepare a strawman and let you guys have a look and give your approval at that time.

Any approved changes to the current configuration will be scheduled for Friday Nov. 30.

Regards,
Tammy
