I've left a message for Dominion's counsel, telling him that we disagree with their position that they can terminate the gas contract, and asking him to educate us as to why they don't think that action is stayed.
We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.
Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.
