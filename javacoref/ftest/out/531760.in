Davis insists on energy refunds
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published June 21, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gray Davis demanded Wednesday that power generators refund
California nearly $9 billion in electricity charges.
"It is unconscionable for the generators to profit from their egregious
overcharges," Davis told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
Davis' testimony highlighted a change in political tactics in the state's
power crisis after a Monday order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
expanding wholesale price relief for California and 10 other Western states.
And the governor got some support from two FERC members who said Wednesday
that they are prepared to order California's energy suppliers to make heavy
refunds because of overcharging.
But the two commissioners -- Pat Wood III and William Massey -- agreed with
their FERC colleagues that California officials and energy companies should
be given a chance to settle the multibillion-dollar refund dispute in the
next three weeks before the commission acts, the Washington Post reported.
During his testimony, Davis gave tepid praise to FERC, which he said "finally
took a positive step" in imposing the limits. But he continued to press the
independent agency to recover what he said were overcharges.
"The FERC has been on a sit-down strike ... because we haven't received a
dime," Davis said.
The commission's action on price controls has been well-received, diminishing
appeals among West Coast Democratic governors and lawmakers and a handful of
Republicans for congressionally mandated caps.
But the commission's order didn't quiet demands that generators be required
to pay back overcharges, and Davis led the charge Wednesday to exploit that
issue.
Davis said the California Independent System Operator, the Folsom-based
agency that manages the state's power grid, found the state was billed $8.9
billion more than the competitive market would have warranted for power
deliveries for the 13 months ending June 1.
Davis insisted that FERC move promptly to "order the energy companies to give
back the money," and that Congress should help pressure the agency to do so.
"I do believe that FERC should get a clear signal on refunds from this
committee," Davis told the Democrat-controlled panel during a hearing into
whether FERC has responded properly to the crisis.
The energy commission has ordered reviews of about $124 million in potential
overcharges in the past several months. But that amount is dwarfed by the
$8.9 billion that Davis is now seeking in refunds.
While the commission is continuing to review possible overcharges, it has yet
to order a single dollar in refunds. The power generators deny they have
overcharged California, saying market conditions and the utilities' shaky
credit ratings warranted high prices.
Wood and Massey, who talked to the Post after their testimony Wednesday
before the committee, said they are ready to require generators and marketers
to refund revenue that exceeded the price ceilings imposed by FERC on Monday.
"We should have given (the California parties) guidance on refunds," Massey
told the Post. "A good place to start was to take (Monday's) order and apply
it starting October 2000 and see what you get" in refunds.
Depending on the time period and whether private generators and municipal
utilities would be required to pay, the refunds could exceed $1 billion, some
energy attorneys calculated Wednesday.
In its Monday order, the commission said it wanted all the parties to sit
down with an administrative law judge to see if they could work out a refunds
settlement. The settlement conference begins Monday.
Commission Chairman Curt Hebert told the Senate panel at Wednesday's hearing
that if no deal is reached after three weeks, the commission would seek
advice from the judge on how it might order a resolution.
"The commission stands ready to act expeditiously," Hebert pledged.
While Davis took the offensive at Wednesday's hearing, Republicans didn't
give him a free ride. The Republican National Committee passed out hand fans
touted as "Gray Davis' solution for summer blackouts."
The fans were paid for by a small Sacramento Republican consulting firm, MB
Associates.
The questioning by the committee's chairman, Sen. Joe Lieberman of
Connecticut, and other Democrats was friendly. But Republicans tried to paint
Davis as the culprit in a crisis he could have solved a year ago.
"How did you let things get totally out of hand?" asked Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's senior Republican.
Davis said his administration began the push to build new generating plants
to meet the impending power shortage four months after he took office in
1999.
"I make no apologies for the aggressive actions we've taken," the governor
said.
Republican lawmakers warned that demanding refunds could actually add to
California's power woes if energy investors become spooked about sanctions
and take their business elsewhere -- resulting in a decreased electricity
supply.
Under pointed questioning from Thompson, Davis shot back.
"The people I represent are mad. They want us to fight back," Davis said.
"... Obviously, we want the state to be an attractive place for investment.
But we don't want companies walking all over our citizens."
Separately, the top Republican on the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources
Committee said it was unrealistic -- and perhaps unfair -- for Davis to
expect FERC to immediately order refunds.
"They're going to have to go back to court and prove these charges that,
indeed, there was manipulation in the marketing of power. And that's going to
be very difficult to do," said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
Even if a refund deal is reached, it's uncertain how much of an effect it
might have. Of the $8.9 billion identified by the ISO, roughly two-thirds of
that was incurred by California utilities that still owe generators billions
of dollars for past power deliveries.
Hebert also noted that ratepayers in other Western states would have to be
included in refund considerations.
Meanwhile, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said
Wednesday that because of FERC's action, they were pulling back their bill,
at least for now, to require that wholesale prices in the West be set at the
cost of production, plant by plant, plus a margin of profit.
However, House Democrats said that while they were happy the commission had
taken action, they still want a vote on a tougher price-cap proposal offered
by Democratic Reps. Jay Inslee of Washington and Nancy Pelosi of San
Francisco.

Energy Digest: State moves to tax plants


(Published June 21, 2001)
In a move aimed at squeezing more tax revenue from large in-state power
generators, the state Board of Equalization on Wednesday edged closer to
stripping local governments of their authority to tax power plants.
State Controller Kathleen Connell, a member of the board, proposed that the
state take over the assessments.
The amount local governments may assess power plants is limited by
Proposition 13, but the state is able to place higher values on the
properties.
Supporters of the move say the state could collect $70 million to $100
million more than local governments.
But the board's staff, while acknowledging that the state could extract more
from power plants than local governments during the current energy crisis,
said it is unclear what would happen to the price of power and value of power
plants in the future.
Local governments, worried that the new assessment system could shortchange
their revenues, opposed the move. But the board, which voted unanimously to
give the plan tentative approval, said the Legislature intends to distribute
the power plant money as though it were taxed locally.
Plants producing fewer than 50 megawatts and co-generation facilities would
be exempted from the rule change. The bill closely resembles AB 81 by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which has been approved by the
Assembly and awaits Senate action.

Davis demands nearly $9 billion for electricity overcharges



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 20, 2001
WASHINGTON ) California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund
nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal
regulators have "looked the other way while energy companies bilked our
state."
Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and 10 other
Western states was a step forward. "But its actions do nothing about the
overcharges" over the past year, he said.
The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans, who charge he
has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand.

Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis




Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up approval for new
power plants and strengthened conservation programs. He also said the state
has little control over price gouging by out-of-state power generators.
"The governor once said he could solve California's problems in 15 minutes.
... But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true
cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities,"
putting California taxpayers in jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.
Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities
not under FERC jurisdiction
Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee,
said the FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity sales, has been slow to
respond and "surprisingly reluctant" to assure that electricity prices are
just and reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.
The agency's response to the Western power problem "raises serious questions
about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy
markets" not only in the West but across the rest of the country.
The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in the day,
imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in California and 10 other
Western states from Washington to Arizona. The agency also ordered the
parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on
overcharges and other issues.
Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged overcharges by power
generators. The power companies have since challenged the agency's findings
and the matter remains in dispute.
"To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California,"
complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and the beginning of this
month power generators are believed to have overcharged California $8.9
billion.
"They must be required to give us back our money," said Davis. "It is
unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked
our state for up to $9 billion."
The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27 billion in 2000
and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this year, said Davis. "Power
generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market," he
said.
Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the
problem. He said newly approved power plants will provide 20,000 additional
megawatts of electricity by 2003, including 4,000 megawatts by the end of
this summer. "Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable
energy to California is being done ... except wholesale price relief," he
said.
"This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more months," said Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President Bush's repeated refusal to urge
the FERC to mitigate electricity prices. Bush has strongly opposed price
controls, although he indicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation
effort this week.
Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that
businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC press its
investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California
but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity prices have also skyrocketed.
Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on
the cost of generation at individual power plants.
"Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price
is laughable," said Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the committee's ranking
Republican. Hard price caps "don't work when supply is the problem. ... They
make a bad situation worse," he said.
After FERC issued its limited price control order this week, Senate Democrats
on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent
cost-based price caps on Western electricity sales.
Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to pursue a bill
requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.




Davis spars with GOP senators over electricity rates



By Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 20, 2001
WASHINGTON ) California Gov. Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans
Wednesday as he blamed federal regulators for averting their gaze from an
alleged $9 billion scheme to bilk the state's electricity consumers.
Testifying in front of the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Davis
demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order power
companies to refund the overcharges. But the governor also found himself
obliged to ward off GOP claims that Davis' own policies triggered the state's
energy crisis.
The partisan give-and-take reflected the mounting political stakes involved
in California's plight. With both parties preparing for next year's
congressional elections, the subtext of Davis' testimony appeared to involve
a recognition that the state's energy problems could affect the outcome of
several California races.
"How did you let things get so totally out of hand?" asked Sen. Fred Thompson
of Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, as he greeted Davis who
made a long-awaited appearance here after weeks of transcontinental sniping
over assigning responsibility for the state's energy woes.
Thompson's question could have been lifted from the script of a $1.5 million
GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that
attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis.
Davis' rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power
on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation.
"We've been working on this for a very long time, and to suggest otherwise
would be inaccurate," he told Thompson.
Saying that he is determined to hold "FERC's feet to the fire" on the refund
issue, Davis complained to the committee, "It is unconscionable that the
commission looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for
up to $9 billion."
Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground with
California voters since the electricity crisis hit, but Wednesday's round of
activities here found him on the offensive.
"Obviously, this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him,"
observed Norm Ornstein, a congressional affairs expert at the American
Enterprise Institute.
Several hours after Davis completed his testimony, the five FERC
commissioners appeared before the committee, but they largely ignored the
governor's accusations.
On Monday, FERC issued an order restricting energy prices in California and
much of the West for the next 15 months and setting up a procedure for
reviewing refund claims.
"The commission is not ducking these issues," said FERC Chairman Curtis L.
Hebert.
However, there remains a substantial gap between Davis' calculation of
electricity overcharges in California and the $124.5 million in refunds
assessed so far by FERC.
The struggle over refunds will enter a new phase on Monday when the review
procedure outlined by FERC will begin before FERC's chief administrative law
judge, Curtis L. Wagner Jr. Pairing off against the power companies will be
senior officials of the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
power grid.
Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the $9 billion
estimate of California's electricity overcharge.
"To date, not a single penny has been returned to Californians," Davis told
the committee. "It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep
these egregious overcharges."
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gouging,
and Davis said later he would anticipate "some strong action coming out of
his office before the end of the summer."
Davis expects to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bush's two new FERC GOP
appointees, Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell, about "natural gas discrepancies"
in California.
"California was paying two to three times more in natural gas, and the
president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed," Davis told a
press conference after meeting with the California congressional delegation.
Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, and Darrell Issa, R-Vista, were among the
Republicans who met with Davis.
"It was a good meeting with the governor," Hunter said, adding that FERC "has
taken steps to lock down prices, and the results speak for themselves. I
think we are all working together, and it's a good sense of common ground."
That was not the mood in the committee hearing, however.
Sparring with Davis, Thompson argued that there had been ample advance
warnings of the crisis, including a 1998 report foreseeing an imminent energy
shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of
economic growth spurred by the energy-intensive high-tech industry.
"Did you see those developments?" Thompson asked. "Did they cause you
concern?"
Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor, Gov. Pete Wilson,
and the State Legislature that designed an energy deregulation plan now
widely recognized as having been seriously flawed.
However, he said those problems did not become apparent until last year.
Thompson also criticized Davis' recent rhetoric castigating the power
companies for price gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by
dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the state's
power infrastructure.
"The people I represent are mad," replied Davis. "They want us to fight back
and that's what I'm doing."
He said he is determined that the state cease serving as "a cash cow to a lot
of energy companies."





Poway not proceeding on power plant proposal



Council worried about financial burden
By Brian E. Clark
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
POWAY -- Citing financial risks, the City Council has pulled the plug on a
proposed $40 million power plant in the South Poway Business Park.
Though there was no formal vote, Mayor Mickey Cafagna told City Manager Jim
Bowersox -- who was lukewarm at best to the proposed plant -- that his staff
should not spend any more time or money on the project.
So-called "peaker" plants are small, less-efficient plants that can produce
up to 50 megawatts of electricity. Usually they run only several hours a day,
when demand is greatest.
At the council meeting Tuesday night, Cafagna said he saw little reason to
invest in the plant, especially since there are no guarantees that Poway
could claim any of the power it produced.
Instead, he said the city should monitor a plan put forth by Rep. Duncan
Hunter, R-El Cajon, that would coordinate the use of diesel generators owned
by large businesses to help avoid the blackouts that are expected to plague
the state this summer.
If the council had chosen to proceed with the peaker-plant proposal -- an
idea it first explored in March -- it would have had to pay San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. up to $30,000 to go through the application process. An
additional $70,000 would have been authorized for a consultant.
Those two figures made City Council members blanch.
"I'm not willing to commit any of the public's money on this," said
Councilwoman Betty Rexford. "I think it would be better for the city to be
handing out energy-efficient light bulbs to save energy."




Campaign helps seniors bear summer



Program to use stickers identifying 'cool zones'
By Anne Krueger
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
During a heat wave or rolling blackout this summer, look to the polar bear
for relief.
The bear is on a decal that will be placed at the entrances of about 60
buildings around San Diego County that have been designated as "cool zones."
The program kicks off today, the first day of summer.
The cool zones were the idea of Supervisor Dianne Jacob. She was looking for
a way to offer relief to seniors and the disabled who are particularly
vulnerable to heat exhaustion and dehydration.
Jacob said she was concerned that many seniors might not use their air
conditioners this summer because of high electric bills. Or they would have
to suffer through a power outage during a rolling blackout.
She said she wants to avoid a disaster like the one in Chicago in 1995. More
than 500 residents, most of them elderly, died when the power went out during
a heat wave.
The buildings identified as cool zones include senior centers, libraries,
enclosed shopping malls, and even courthouses. Some of the cool zones, such
as senior centers or libraries, may have planned programs, but other
buildings will simply provide a place to get out of the heat.
"If people want to read on their own or knit or chat, at least there will be
places for them to cool off," said Denise Nelesen, spokeswoman for the county
Office of Aging and Independence Services, which is coordinating the program.
Many of the buildings designated as cool zones are popular spots already. At
Parkway Plaza in El Cajon, 79-year-old William Richards of North Park sat on
a bench sipping a soda. He said that although he lives closer to Fashion
Valley, an outdoor mall in Mission Valley, he prefers Parkway Plaza, in part,
because it's enclosed.
"It's more comfortable," Richards said. "It's just a nice place to walk
around."
The Lemon Grove Senior Center is getting a polar bear sticker, too. Even
without the air-conditioning turned on. Officials there are prudently waiting
for the heat to hit before flipping the switch.
A group of women played mah-jongg there Tuesday as a breeze came through the
open door. "We'll be glad to share our space, if it's cool," said Eve Butler.
Jacob said providing transportation to cool zones is still a problem that
hasn't been worked out. She said money may be available through the state
Public Utilities Commission.
Nelesen said the county also is helping shut-in seniors through its Project
Care program, in which the seniors receive a regular phone call to check on
their welfare. Mail carriers and utility workers are being trained to look
for signs that a senior may require assistance, Nelesen said.




Business leaders unite to back new SDG&E line



Coalition to lobby for transmission plan
By Jeff McDonald
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
A group of San Diego business leaders have formed a coalition to promote a
major improvement to the San Diego Gas & Electric transmission grid.
The utility is seeking approval for a 500,000-volt transmission line that
would run from southwest Riverside County to north San Diego County. SDG&E
hopes to have the so-called Valley Rainbow Interconnect in place by 2004.
San Diego business executives plan to lobby state energy regulators to
approve the 30-mile set of looming poles and high-voltage wires in order to
boost capacity along the SDG&E transmission network.
"The Valley Rainbow Interconnect will ensure a reliable delivery of power for
San Diegans for years to come," said Jessie Knight Jr. of the San Diego
Regional Chamber of Commerce.
The collection of business leaders includes chamber officials as well as
executives of the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council and the San Diego
Economic Development Corp.
Calling themselves the San Diego County Valley Rainbow Alliance, members plan
to testify at California Public Utilities Commission meetings on behalf of
the project.
Three community hearings have been scheduled by the CPUC to solicit input on
the proposal from residents of San Diego and Riverside counties. They were
scheduled in Pauma Valley and the Riverside County communities of Winchester
and Temecula.
No organized opposition to the network has surfaced in San Diego County.
But a group of Temecula Valley area residents have spent months fighting the
project. Among other things, they worry about the effect that the
long-planned series of 190-foot poles might have on their property values.
The CPUC held a hearing last night at the Pauma Valley Community Center.
Another hearing on the application will be held at 6:30 tonight at the
Temecula Community Recreation Center.

Governor adamant on refund at hearing



Davis, on Capitol Hill visit, deflects blame for shortages

COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 21, 2001
WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans yesterday as he
blamed federal regulators for ignoring what he said was a $9 billion scheme
by power companies to bilk Californians.
Testifying before the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Davis demanded
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order power companies to refund
the overcharges.
But the governor was forced to respond to Republican claims that his policies
turned a solveable problem into a full-blown energy crisis.
The partisan give-and-take reflected the mounting political stakes involved
in California's plight. The subtext of Davis' testimony involved a
recognition that the state's energy problems could affect the outcome of
several California House races next year, as well as the governor's own
re-election.
"How did you let things get so totally out of hand?" Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, asked Davis.
Thompson's question could have been lifted from the script of a $1.5 million
GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that
attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis. The campaign
follows weeks of criticism by Davis of federal regulators and of President
Bush for failing to address the energy problem.

"We've been working on this for a very long time, and to suggest otherwise

The Democratic governor said he is determined to hold "FERC's feet to the
fire" on the refund issue.
"It is unconscionable that the commission looked the other way while energy
companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion," he said.
Davis' grievances received more attention here than they might have just
weeks ago, before Democrats took control of the Senate and its committees
after Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont bolted the Republican Party to become an
independent. A sympathetic committee chairman, Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman
of Connecticut, made Davis the star witness of yesterday's hearing.
Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground with
California voters since the electricity crisis hit, but Republicans have
acknowledged that Davis and Democrats in recent weeks have gained the upper
hand over the Bush administration in the energy debate.
Despite some GOP criticism yesterday, Davis was clearly on the offensive.
"Obviously, this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him,"
observed Norm Ornstein, a congressional affairs expert at the American

"To date, not a single penny has been returned to Californians," Davis told
the committee. "It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep
these egregious overcharges."
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., yesterday introduced legislation to provide for
refunds.
The power companies, although acknowledging huge profits, have denied
allegations of price gouging or market manipulation.
"There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone," Mark
Stultz, a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association, told the
Associated Press.
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gouging,
and Davis said after the hearing he anticipated "some strong action" from
Lockyer in the next few months.
Davis said he plans to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bush's two new FERC
appointees, Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell, about "natural gas discrepancies"

Little-known transmission company has billion-dollar backers

SACRAMENTO ) Through an alliance with a little-known start-up company,
General Electric Co. is trying to enter California's transmission lines
business.
Although Trans-Elect, a two-year-old company based in Washington, has no
experience in the transmission business, it has the financial support of GE's
$66 billion financial arm, GE Capital. Trans-Elect's latest offer comes as
Gov. Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the
transmission lines of both San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California
Edison.
Any involvement by GE in the state's transmission grid could be a conflict of
interest, said a key lawmaker involved in the efforts to end California's
yearlong power crisis.
"You've got someone with generation and transmission systems, how do they
keep them separate and do they?" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder
Creek. "That's a concern for me. Would they have the ability to restrict
competitors' access to transmissions?"
Trans-Elect first made overtures to buy the transmission lines in February,
offering more than $5 billion for those owned by SDG&E, Edison and Pacific
Gas and Electric.
Although Davis has reached a deal with Edison to buy their lines for $2.76
billion and a $1 billion pact with SDG&E, Trans-Elect has said it will offer
Edison $1.8 billion and SDG&E $700 million.
Bob Mitchell, Trans-Elect's vice president, said the company made its offer
believing that the Legislature won't approve the deals to buy the two
utilities' lines.
GE joined forces with Trans-Elect March 14, when GE Capital Services
Structured Finances Group Inc. announced it had bought a minority stake in
the company. Neither company would reveal the size of the investment.
But a GE statement said its investment enables "GE Capital Global Energy to
co-invest with Trans-Elect as it acquires transmission assets throughout the
U.S."
Now, however, both GE and Trans-Elect are trying to downplay their
relationship.
Ken Koprowski, a GE spokesman, said the company made "a small financial
investment and we're not involved in the management of the company." He added
that the company invests in many other energy projects, including power
plants.
"There's no connection with what we're doing in California and GE," Mitchell
said.
What Koprowski and Mitchell call a low-profile arrangement has generated
lobbying activity. Several lawmakers said they had met with Mitchell about
Trans-Elect's offer.
GE Capital hired lobbyist Phillip Schott a week after investing in
Trans-Elect. Schott referred calls to GE's lobbyist, Kahl/Pownall Advocates,
one of California's biggest political lobbying firms. Fred Pownall,
Kahl/Pownall's head, referred all questions on the bill to GE Capital
headquarters.
In California, many hurdles remain for Trans-Elect. First, the Legislature
would have to kill the deals with SDG&E and Edison. Then the companies would
have to turn to Trans-Elect to buy their lines.
So far, utility leaders are skeptical. Edison CEO John Bryson rejected the
Trans-Elect offer Tuesday, calling it a "phony" bid by an unknown company.
"We don't know this company. I suppose nobody does," Bryson said at a town
hall meeting in Los Angeles. The reason the transmission lines are in the
deal "is that we consider it our responsibility to try to stay serving our
customers as a healthy utility."
Other than the governor's offer, the transmission system isn't for sale,
Bryson said.
Trans-Elect remains interested in investing in California, but has postponed
sending a letter offering $1.8 billion for Edison's lines, Mitchell said.
"I think it's potentially an attractive deal, when we can create the right
climate for it," Mitchell said. "From the perspective of the people of
California, it's one less financial obligation they have to take on."
The Memorandum of Understanding between Edison and the governor needs
legislative approval by August, and many lawmakers have balked at the plan.
Keeley said he isn't convinced that selling the assets to a private company
is the best long-term solution for the state.
"I'm not prepared at this stage to believe that we should sell something as
significant as the transmission system to an entity that is not regulated by
the state and where our ability to have anything to say about the
transmission system is in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's venue,"
he said.
Should the Davis plan fail, Mitchell says his offer would remain.
"It appears to me and many other people that the Legislature is not going to
allow the people of California to pay an excessively high price," he said.
The $1.8 billion offer is "a very strong price."
Mitchell said he doesn't blame the utilities for rejecting his initial
offers, since the governor has promised more. But he stressed that the
company has a future in the industry, and plans to go public eventually.
Formed in 1998, Trans-Elect is trying to be the country's first national
transmission company. As utilities deregulate, they are allowed to sell
assets, including the transmission lines.
The American Transmission Company, a private transmission company based in
Wisconsin, has a similar mission as Trans-Elect, but not the level of
financial backing, said ATC spokeswoman Maripat Blankenheim.
"They're out there out with a really big check book," she said.




Davis Asks for Energy Refund Help
Power: Governor urges U.S. Senate action to get "back the money that was
wrongly taken from us."

By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON--California Gov. Gray Davis, seeking to shift the focus of
the energy debate, urged Congress on Wednesday to turn up the political heat
on federal regulators to help California recover $9 billion in estimated
overcharges by power generators.
Davis told a Senate panel that the order issued Monday by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to limit Western electricity prices was "a step
in the right direction." But more aggressive action is needed, he said, to
"give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us."




Gov. Gray Davis wipes his brow outside the Capitol after discussing his
remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

Davis' remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee suggest that
the political warfare between Sacramento and Washington did not end with
FERC's decision to police wholesale electricity prices more aggressively.
By demanding federal intervention to recover money already paid to power
generators, Davis continued to insist that the Bush administration and
federal regulators must share responsibility for solving the state's energy
problems.
"Yes, they have provided some relief," Davis said of FERC's price
mitigation mandate. "But that's only half the job. The other half of the job
is give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us."
On his first trip to Capitol Hill since Democrats took control of the
Senate, Davis appeared before a Governmental Affairs Committee that displayed
more sympathy toward his administration than it did when Republicans ruled it.
One committee member, fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey,
bluntly warned FERC: "We are watching how the people of California are
treated, and we are watching very, very closely."
Davis noted that federal regulators have already determined that
wholesale power rates charged to California were "unjust and unreasonable."
Even so, he said, "not a single penny in refunds has been returned to
California."

Governor Calls Rates 'Egregious'
"It's unconscionable if generators are allowed to keep these egregious
overcharges," Davis said, imploring the committee to "hold FERC's feet to the
fire."
California's electricity grid operator has calculated that the state
paid about $9 billion more than a competitive market would warrant for
electricity from May 2000 to May 2001. So far, FERC has only identified about
$124 million in possible overcharges, which were confined to January and
February.
To some extent, FERC has already agreed to play a bigger role in seeking
refunds, although not necessarily the full $9 billion that Davis is seeking.
Next week, representatives of the state, electric utilities and power
generating companies are scheduled to begin talks in Washington on possible
refunds.




California Gov. Gray Davis testifies before a Senate committee. He implored
its members to "hold FERC's feet to the fire." AFP

The settlement conference, which begins Monday, is scheduled to run for
15 consecutive days, including weekends, which is unusual for a regulatory
proceeding.
Presiding over the conference will be Chief Administrative Law Judge
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., who admonished participants Wednesday to make sure that
they send representatives who have authority to approve any agreements
reached during the negotiations. Wagner can extend the conference if
necessary.
The purpose of the conference is to settle past accounts and structure
"new arrangements for California's energy future," Wagner said in a
scheduling order. To reach those goals, the parties must agree on how much of
the electricity load will be shifted away from the volatile spot market for
immediate delivery into stable, long-term contracts, refunds and
"credit-worthiness matters," the order said.
Edison General Counsel Stephen E. Pickett said the utility is pleased
that regulators set up the meeting with power generators to discuss refunds
to the utilities dating back to Oct. 2.
"Certainly, it is a positive step toward resolving many of these
issues," Pickett said in a conference call Tuesday with creditors.
San Diego Gas & Electric expressed similar muted optimism.
"SDG&E has been a supporter of customer refunds, and we're encouraged
that the FERC is working toward a settlement," SDG&E spokesman Art Larson
said.
But Reliant Energy spokeswoman Pat Hammond expressed skepticism about
the $9-billion overcharge figure cited by Davis. "That number sounds like the
price of all the power they've bought in the last year in California, and we
obviously don't feel that is owed" by Reliant and other power producers.
Donato Eassey, a Houston-based energy analyst for Merrill Lynch, said he
expects the FERC-mediated conference to produce a compromise in which all
parties--generators, utilities and consumers--get "a haircut." But that
outcome, he suggested, might beat the alternatives.
"You've got to put this problem behind you," he said, "because if you
don't, you'll have a problem of biblical proportions."

FERC Members Also Before Senate Panel
Adding to the pressure for refunds, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
introduced a bill Wednesday that would require FERC to order rebates if
federal regulators determine that prices charged were "unjust and
unreasonable."
The five members of FERC's governing board also appeared Wednesday
before the Senate panel but were scheduled later in the day to avoid a public
confrontation with Davis.
The governor met privately Wednesday with two new board members,
including Patrick H. Wood III, a Bush ally from Texas who, according to
Davis, has indicated a "more aggressive approach to refunds might be in
order."
Still, there was no shortage of partisanship at the committee hearing.
Republican aides passed out hand-held fans bearing the inscription:
"Gray Davis' solution for summer blackouts." Davis handed out a slick
177-page book detailing steps his administration has taken to ease the power
crunch. The Bush administration issued a Department of Energy study asserting
that California would face twice as many rolling blackouts if hard price caps
were imposed on wholesale electricity.
Davis did not escape a scolding from Republican senators for his
criticism of the Bush administration's refusal to impose firm price controls.
Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) pointedly asked Davis "how he let things
get totally out of hand" and excoriated the governor for assigning blame for
the state's problems to the Bush administration, federal regulators, former
Gov. Pete Wilson and various "corporate pirates." He also faulted Davis for
not acting sooner to pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers.
"If I passed on a 700% increase to the citizens of California, there
would be an outrage the likes of which you have never seen," Davis responded.
Republican senators also challenged Davis on how he hopes to stimulate
more power plant construction in California if state officials continue to
attack generating companies. They noted that the state attorney general even
suggested that the chairman of one power company deserved to be locked in a
cell with an amorous inmate named Spike.
"This is a rough business," Davis responded. "The people I represent are
mad."
He also told his Republican critics: "If you were in my shoes and facing
the extraordinary price increases, you would feel as I do. Our first
obligation is to fight back."
Davis urged the committee to keep pressure on FERC to rein in natural
gas prices, which until recently have been as much as eight times higher than
the national average.
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. assured the committee that his agency
is aggressively pursuing remedies to California's energy price spikes and
supply shortages. "We have been engaged," he said, citing more than 60 orders
issued by the agency to address the power crisis.
Commissioner William L. Massey, a Democrat who has urged stronger
federal intervention in the electricity markets, said he regrets the
commission did not act sooner.
"Businesses have closed down, putting thousands out of work and hurting
the Western economy, and all because of a broken electricity market," he
said. "By acting 10 months ago, we could have prevented much of the economic
carnage."
Despite the tensions, Davis elicited some sympathy from even his
Republican critics.
"I wouldn't wish your problems on my worst enemy," Thompson told Davis.

House Approves Utility Aid for Needy
Congress: Bill would add $300 million to program that helps families pay
their bills. Strict price caps are blocked.

By JANET HOOK, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON--In its first direct legislative response to the nation's
burgeoning energy crisis, the House on Wednesday approved legislation that
would provide an additional $300 million to help low-income families pay
their power bills.
The bill amounts to a midyear increase of 21% for the $1.4-billion
energy assistance program--twice as much as President Bush had proposed
adding to help the poor cope with increases in utility bills.
Before final action on the bill, House Republican leaders blocked
Democratic efforts to force votes on a broader response to the energy crisis
in the West: strict energy price caps that reach beyond the restraints
imposed Monday by federal regulators.
Republicans argued that price caps would not solve California's energy
problem, while Democrats accused the GOP of being cavalier about the crisis
faced by consumers.
"This says to the people of the West, 'Your emergency doesn't count to
us,' " said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).
But such assertions were countered by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas), who said: "Members should reject the siren song of price caps and
remember this: Government price controls will mean more blackouts."
The issue erupted during debate on a $6.5-billion midyear appropriation
bill to cover unanticipated costs and emergency expenditures, including $5.5
billion for the Defense Department and $116 million to help the Internal
Revenue Service pay the cost of sending out rebate checks authorized by the
recently enacted tax cut law.
The measure passed, 341 to 87.
In an earlier vote, Bush barely escaped an embarrassing slap when
Democrats moved to cut the proposed IRS increase by $29 million--the cost of
a letter the agency is sending to tell taxpayer of their impending tax rebate.
Democrats complained that the letter, which prominently mentions Bush,
reads like a piece of campaign literature. Republicans said it was needed to
save people from calling the IRS about their checks. The amendment failed,
216 to 212.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where Democrats are considering an even
bigger increase in energy aid for the poor.
Overall, the House bill would provide the $6.5 billion requested by
Bush. But it would change some spending priorities. For instance, Bush's
Office of Management and Budget objects strongly to provisions that would
rescind $389 million in money appropriated for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency--just as the disaster relief agency is facing big outlays
to cope with damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison.
That provision to rescind the money came under attack from Democrats and
Republicans, posing the debate's most serious challenge to the bill. But an
effort to send the bill back to the Appropriations Committee and restore the
money was defeated on a party line vote of 218 to 209.
The energy aid for the poor is provided through the Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Program, which helps the poor and elderly pay heating and
air-conditioning bills. In California, a family of four must earn less than
$33,125 to be eligible, and the average benefit is $326 a year.
Although Republicans and Democrats have been divided over broad
questions of energy policy, there has been a bipartisan consensus on more
help for needy consumers. So, despite pressure to hold down the cost of the
supplemental spending bill, House Republicans doubled Bush's request for $150
billion in additional energy aid. GOP leaders blocked, on procedural
technicalities, Democratic amendments to increase the funding even more.
Republican leaders also fought efforts by Democrats to turn debate on
the spending bill into Congress' first broad-gauged discussion on the
nation's energy crisis. Democrats wanted to offer major energy amendments,
including one to impose strict cost-based price caps on wholesale electricity
in California--stricter price restraints than the policy announced Monday by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Proponents of the stricter caps, echoing complaints by California Gov.
Gray Davis and others, said FERC's order did not go far enough to guarantee
relief for consumers against blackouts, shortages and price gouging.
Republicans argued that price caps would be counterproductive and that
California's problems will be solved only by increasing the energy supply.
Democrats lost a 222-205 procedural vote that blocked their amendments
from coming to a vote.It was an important victory for Republican leaders who
had feared mounting support for price caps even within their own party.
However, momentum flagged this week after the FERC decision.
The House bill also includes:
* $45 million for a Defense Department plan to make military bases in
California self-sufficient and get them off the state's power grid during
shortages.
* $1.5 million for planning and environmental studies for a proposed
upgrade in an electrical transmission line in Central California known as
Path 15.




Summer Starts, Power Doesn't Stop
Energy: Consumers show they can take the heat, with their conservation
helping to limit demand. But experts remain wary.

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer

As unwelcome as the killer bees, as hyped as "Pearl Harbor," the big,
bad summer of 2001 officially arrived today and--did someone forget to turn
out the lights?
After months of dread, the Blackout Summer began on a curiously bright
note. Despite several days of summer-like weather, there was barely a whisper
about blackouts. The state that couldn't plug in a night light in January
without tripping electrical shortage alarms managed to enter the summer with
electricity to spare.
For the moment, power supplies look healthy. Wholesale electricity
prices are a sliver of what they were just a month ago. Demand for power is
down, apparently the result of a successful conservation campaign. And
California officials appear to have won their months-long battle with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which imposed price and supply controls
on the Western electricity market beginning at midnight last night.
All in all, an auspicious beginning for what many have warned would be a
dreadful summer. So why aren't California energy officials blowing up
balloons for the big end-of-crisis party?
"We are not out of the woods," said Richard Sklar, the state's energy
supply czar. "We are not out of the woods on price, and we are not out of the
woods on availability."
His view is echoed by most of those who closely watch the state's
electrical market. So far, California's supply-demand balance is coming
closer to best-case predictions than to the worst. But it is a delicate
balance.
On Wednesday, with temperatures hovering around summer norms, operators
of the statewide power grid managed to maintain--if just barely--the 7% of
operating reserves they strive for. When reserves dip below that, the state
begins ascending the ladder of staged emergency declarations that eventually
lead to blackouts.
Total electricity use in the state peaked about 4 p.m. at 39,156
megawatts--a high for the year, but well below the state's all-time record of
45,884 megawatts, which was set on July 12, 1999.
State officials credit conservation with shaving off about 4,000
megawatts, an amount that easily means the difference between blackouts or no
blackouts on most days.
"There is no doubt in my mind that conservation . . . has led directly
to the situation that we're in now," said Mike Sloss, who tracks conservation
for the California Energy Commission.
Richard Roher, who crunches conservation numbers for the commission,
said consumers appear to be continuing to cut their electricity use by about
11%.
There also has been good news on the supply side of the equation. After
months in which power plant breakdowns and shutdowns were costing the state
as much as 15,000 megawatts of electricity at a time, most plants are now
online and outages were down to 4,300 megawatts Wednesday.
Most small, alternative energy suppliers finally reached agreement this
week in their epic contract battle with Southern California Edison, putting
that vital segment of the state's energy production back in business. And in
the next two weeks, the state's first two new major power plants in a decade
are scheduled to open, adding more than 1,000 megawatts to the power
stream--enough to serve about 750,000 typical homes.
State officials are also hoping that the FERC ruling, which limits
prices in the 11-state Western region and requires generators to sell
available power to California, will ease the situation further.
"Everyone is very interested to see how tomorrow unfolds, price-wise and
supply-wise," Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for California's grid
operator, said Wednesday.
For all the positive signs, no one is predicting that the state will
weather the summer without blackouts. No one knows how many power plants will
break down. Nor does anyone know the extent to which Californians' best
intentions to conserve will melt away in a sustained heat wave.
While the past few days have been hot, they haven't been searing. It was
81 in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, 94 in Riverside, 102 in Sacramento,
109 in Palm Springs--toasty, but far from the hottest weather any of those
places can expect this summer.
Nor was it unusually hot in surrounding states, whose ability to sell
power to California depends in part on their own energy needs. Electricity
use generally rises with the thermometer, because air conditioners use more
power than most other appliances.
"If it gets hot in California, and it's also hot in the Northwest . . .
and it's hot in Phoenix, we could run into some significant problems," said
Jan Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers
Assn., a trade group for power plant owners in California.
The state has benefited recently from imports of electricity from the
Northwest, where snow runoff is cascading through electrical turbines. But
those imports are expected to dry up later in the summer as stream flowswhich
have been kept high to assist salmon runs--are scaled back to levels that
reflect the region's winter drought.
So the summer of 2001 could still be interesting. And it may begin with
a blackout after all. For weeks now, an e-mail campaign has spread through
the Internet, calling on people to voluntarily cut off most or all of their
power between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. tonight.
The protest, called the "Roll Your Own Blackout," is the idea of a
Southern California artist who worked in tandem with a software engineer from
Berkeley. Their intention is to protest the energy policies recently
announced by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.
"When you hear Mr. Cheney, who drafted the energy plan, deriding
conservation as merely a personal virtue, it is as though he believes virtue
has no place in government policy, and that would be a very dangerous thing,"
said Dave Aragon, the software engineer.
The California crisis gave birth to their campaign, but Aragon said he
is hoping that the protest goes beyond the state's borders.
"Worldwide would be fine," he said.






Board Votes to Let State Tax Power Plants
Proposal: Levies on property currently are made by counties. The revenue
would increase, say proponents of change.

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--State tax collectors endorsed a proposal Wednesday that
could force power plant owners to pay tens of millions of dollars more in
taxes next year.
The five-member Board of Equalization voted unanimously to assert
jurisdiction over the property taxes paid by companies with power plants that
produce more than 50 megawatts. Under the board's proposal--which faces
public hearings before it takes effect--the state would seize from counties
the authority to tax these plants.
State control could potentially enrich government coffers, because the
state would tax the plants based on their fair market value, while counties
tax power plant owners based on the original value of the plants plus a 2%
annual inflation rate.
Consumer advocates argue that the value of private power plants has
skyrocketed in the past year, as the price of wholesale electricity soared in
the malfunctioning market created under California's 1998 deregulation plan.
Under deregulation, utilities sold 22 power plants to private companies,
many of them based out of state, for a total of $3.2 billion.
"They are making exorbitant profits," said Lenny Goldberg, executive
director of the California Tax Reform Assn., a nonprofit group largely funded
by unions. He called the power plants "vastly underassessed."
Board of Equalization Chairwoman and state Controller Kathleen Connell
said the move is necessary not only because it might bring in more tax
revenue, but because California itself could soon build power plants or own
power lines under plans pushed by Gov. Gray Davis.
"We may not be getting the best value through the current system," said
Connell, "especially if the state proceeds with plans to own plants in
California.
"It makes sense to act now to bring all generating facilities under the
same assessment system," she said.
For many decades, the Board of Equalization levied property taxes on
power plants because they were owned by utilities and regulated by the state.
But in 1999, after the launch of deregulation, the tax board voted to allow
counties to assess property taxes on power plants under a formula set by
Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that limits property taxes for
homeowners and businesses.
The board's vote Wednesday launches a process of public hearings that
could lead to a reversal of that 1999 decision.
Officials from several cities that are home to power plants urged the
Board of Equalization to take no action. Under the current system, cities
with power plants get a greater share of property tax revenue, which is
generally split among local governments and schools.
Long Beach got about $55,000 a year in property tax revenue when the
state was assessing taxes, said city Controller Barbara Hennessy, but now
gets nearly $1 million a year.
Shari L. Freidenrich, treasurer for Huntington Beach, said a reversal of
the board's tax method could cost the city--home to a major power plant--$1.5
million a year in property taxes.
A bill pending in the Legislature by Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San
Francisco) would protect those cities by guaranteeing that they get the same
proportion of property tax revenue even if the state reasserts control over
power plant assessments.
Goldberg, of the California Tax Reform Assn., argued that allowing the
state to tax plant owners based on market value would bring in more revenue
for the entire state.
As an example, he estimated that a big power plant on Monterey Bay owned
by Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy North America would have paid Monterey
County at least an additional $10 million in property taxes last year under
the proposed method of assessment. The plant, valued by the county at $362
million, is probably worth about $2 billion given market conditions, Goldberg
said.
The power industry argues that when California lifted state regulation
of power plants in 1998, those plants became businesses no different from a
department store or bakery in terms of property tax status.
"We would expect to be treated like any other business in California has
been treated since Prop. 13 went into place," said Duke spokesman Tom
Williams.



Davis' spinmeisters draw heat from watchdogs
State controller refuses to pay energy advisers

Gov. Gray Davis' decision to hire the "Masters of Disaster" -- two former
Clinton-Gore spin doctors -- has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group and a
refusal by the state controller to pay the two political strategists.
Since the energy crisis began, Davis has hired several nationally known
experts to advise him. But the recent contract for Chris Lehane and Mark
Fabiani has opened a political wound, in part because the two men are
considered fiercely partisan and politically ruthless.
State Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat who continually fights with
Davis, said yesterday that she will refuse to pay Lehane and Fabiani with
state funds. Their contract is worth $180,000 for six months.
Connell said it's hard for her to imagine that Lehane and Fabiani are working
on state policy, as required by law, and not politics.
"From my viewpoint, you're asking Californians to survive with fewer lights
on and you're asking them to assume the burden of $43 billion in long-term
debt for power," Connell said. "It's just another slap in the face to ask
them to pay for people to explain the situation away."
The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly
monitors legislation, filed a lawsuit last week alleging that Fabiani and
Lehane are violating the Political Reform Act because they also have done
work for Southern California Edison as consultants.
It's considered a conflict of interest for public officials to work on issues
that affect companies that pay them more than
