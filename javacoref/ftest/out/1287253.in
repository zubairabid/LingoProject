You should soon receive a PEP System message telling you one or more of the following ETS Facility Planning personnel selected you as a reviewer for 2001.

Mansoor Abdmoulaie		Dennis, Alters			Ken Anderson			Doug Aschwege
Judy Beck			Carolyn DesCoteaux		Dan Dobbins			Eric Faucheaux
Perry Frazier			Maurice Gilbert			Matt Hughes			Bob Johnson
Dave Kolarik			Ron Matthews			Gale Ramsaran			Bryan Reinecke
Becki Sans Souci		Buzz Smith			Roger Westfall

These people are part of a process that will be have them reviewed by their team members, using both team and outside-the-team input (The outside reviewer input is sent to me first, to be edited for reviewer name, etc,).  This team review takes place prior to supervisor review, and I would ask that, in the interest of time, you try to respond to the review request as soon as possible.

Thank you,

Morgan Gottsponer
