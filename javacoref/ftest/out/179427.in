Moveon.org, a group that positions itself as an internet based consumer
watchdog, has mounted a campaign in support of the Federal Energy Reliability
and Stability Act of 2001.  The campaign takes direct aim at enron, dynegy
and other companies. Have a look at their website, at
http://www.moveon.org/priceshocked/index.html.  In the meantime, here's a
copy of a mass, unsolicited email that someone at our PR Firm in NY (ss+k)
received from moveon.org (see below).
