New Xcel Energy Combination Completed

Just 17 months after announcement of merger plans, Minneapolis-based Northern
States Power
and Denver-based New Century Energies have cleared the last hurdle to combine
under the new
name Xcel Energy Inc. The merger creates one of the 10 largest electricity
and natural gas
companies in the United States.

The Securities and Exchange Commission issued its approval of the merger,
wrapping up approvals
from several federal agencies and states where the companies operate. Xcel
Energy will serve more
than 3 million electricity and 1.5 million natural gas customers in 12
states, and 2 million electricity
customers internationally. Company headquarters will be in Minneapolis.
Gradually, the NSP and NCE
names will be phased out as Xcel Energy provides enhanced products and
services in 12 states,
including parts of Minnesota, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas, Michigan, Kansas,
Oklahoma, Arizona, New
Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wyoming.

Stock will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange on Aug. 21, under the
symbol XEL. Current
New Century Energies shareholders will receive 1.55 shares of Xcel Energy
stock for each share of
NCE they hold. NSP shareholders will get one for one and will not be required
to exchange their existing
NSP stock.

The merger proposal was announced March 25, 1999, and completed in less than
a year and a half.
"This has been an incredibly successful merger process," said Jim Howard,
Xcel chairman. "It demonstrates
what can be accomplished when regulators, environmentalists, community
leaders and the merger partners
all work in a common direction --- to create a better utility company for the
future."

"Our strength will come from a base of millions of customers spread over a
large area, combined with our
rapidly growing non-regulated businesses like NRG Energy, now the seventh
largest independent power
producer in the world, " said Wayne Brunetti, Xcel president.
