Christine -- Here's a brief answer to your questions.

With regard to segmentation, Order 637 is completely silent with regard to
rates to be charged for segmented capacity, so we would have considerable
leeway here.  The order is also silent with respect to the effective
restriction of segmented capacity by making discounts inapplicable to certain
alternate (or primary) points.  Hopefully TW will be able to avoid the
segmentation issue altogether by invoking the Global Settlement, as we plan
to do in our rehearing request and compliance filing.  (Our Global Settlement
argument is that we should be able to rely on tariff provisions, including
our current restriction on changing primary points, that were implemented to
mitigate the effects of turnback on TW).

On hourly service, I believe that we could put an hourly service into place
on TW without  running afoul of the Peak and Off-Peak Rates (i.e., seasonal
rates) provisions of the order.  In other words, I think the Commission would
see them as two separate kinds of service.

As for how to communicate with our customers, I believe Regulatory has
offered to have a meeting with TW customers in early April to make a
presentation on Order 637 and provide a forum for discussion.  I realize the
order becomes effective March 27; however, compliance filings are not due
until May 1, and some requirements do not even become effective until
September 1.  Before the beginning of April, the GPG pipelines will simply
not have their positions fully formed enough to make a very well-organized
presentation to persons outside the company.  The meeting is still in the
planning stages and I will fill you in on details as they are available.  In
the meantime, if your customers have questions, I'll be happy to help answer
them.
