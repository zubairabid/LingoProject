Colleagues:

Harry and I are working with Utility Risk Management (URM) and Assurance Services (Misty Barrett) to ensure that the regulatory inputs for their most important curves are correct. These positions represent 60% of Enron's exposure as of Nov. 15, 2001.

In most cases, it is a repetition of what all had done several months ago, and the attached excel sheet builds on it.  You are kindly requested to review the sheet and advise on the following:
a)	Confirm that actual data already in place.
b)	 Advice on the regulatory inputs of the rate schedules marked in red.

GA is hoping to complete this task by early next week (Nov. 27th), so that we can start on determining what needs to be done on a utility-by-utility basis.  Here is the State Assignment.

State	Primary Contact
ME	Dan
MA	Frank
NJ	Frank
OH	Janine
NY	Kathy
GA	Marchris
SC	Marchris
NV	Pat
TX	Pat
IL	Roy
IN	Roy
TN	Roy
CA	Sue Mara


Kindly advise if you have any question, or I could be of any help.
