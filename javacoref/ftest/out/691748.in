To All:

This update clarify's our trading position with the Sempra relationship on
EOL and over the phone:
-All Sempra entities on EOL should maintain their term of 36 months.  This is
approved as a result of the credit controls of EOL.
-Trading over the phone is OK inside 12 months and should be managed between
12 and 36 months accordingly based on the transaction, counterparty current
exposure, contract collateral rights and credit reserve, if any.
-Exposures should be monitored daily by all members of the credit group.

SDG&E Update:
Short Term Power transactions are OK via phone transactions only.
