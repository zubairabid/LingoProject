Jay --
I wanted to talk with first thing on Friday about our decision to weigh in
with testimony in this case.  Forgetting the question Legal may or may not
have (let's assume they don't have any concerns) about Scott testifying, it
is still my opinion that we should not file testimony.
First, I assume that you have already marked your book to the Lynch
"thoughts" on rate design and revenue allocation included in the initial
Order.   I make this assumption, because the loss to EES has already occurred
and our goal now is to try and bring back some of the value by (a) focusing
on revenue sharing and (b) rate design.  Scott indicates that the loss could
be $100MM with bad outcomes on the 2 key issues.  My purpose of EES' activity
is to try and minimize that number.  I feel that a quiet but forceful role in
the case is the best vehicle given our recent troubles in CA and before the
CPUC.
Second, I am not sure that Govt Affairs is comfortable with Scott's model of
rate design.  While tiering of rates is on the table, the question of demand
reduction payback under his framework could result in customers using 70% of
their load and paying nothing.  That hardly makes sense.  Now maybe we just
don't understand, but putting in testimony that is unclear or confusing isn't
going to win the day before the CPUC.
Third, most of our victory will come from aligning with the big users.  If we
are supporting / defending our own testimony (which they haven't seen), I
think that our ability to work through a Settlement will be limited.  Our
goal is to "pick and choose" from the best solutions proposed while trying to
highlight other options through cross-examination (granted, this may be very
hard).
Fourth, someone may try to get EES to weigh in on the allocation of these
costs to DA customers.  We have agreed not to take on that issue.  Scott
doesn't get to use the Fifth Amendment to not answer.
Scott and his team is preparing testimony.  Give me a call.  If Scott and you
are intent on moving forward, we'll do as you see fit within the other
constraints.
