Homecoming will be different this year. Now that there is a campus  stadium,
it has become the centerpiece for homecoming activities. It  sounds like one
big party on campus:

Friday 5-6:30   All School Gathering at the  flagpole
6:30Lighted  Parade along the
Boulevard
7:30-9 Stadium Tours and informal Open
House

Saturday8:30  Pregame Festivities begin(silent auction,
music and             "family fun)
11:00   SMU vs. Nevada
Post game until  6:00pm Class reunions and
designated  class

tents(5 year classes)on the

Boulevard

Now back to Beta stuff.The Gordo's idea for Thursday night has  been
enthusiastically endorsed by all those that have responded. John  Grumbles
has volunteered to arrange seating for us there, so let John know if  you're
going to join us: John_Grumbles@berryplastics.comso  he will have an idea
how many to plan on. We'll get back to you with a time to  meet there and the
new address.

Woody's the man for game tickets: boethia@hotmail.com Let him know how
many you need.

Anybody bringing kids? Carl Hohl is too and would like to talk to you  about
related issues: handshohl@eudormail.com

Chuck Paul was at the stadium opener and thinks it would be a good idea to
have a designated "Beta Tent". We can meet there before  and after the
game. It should attract any other Betas in attendance that  have not
received these mailings.Could be some pleasant surprises. He  thinks it
would cost about $100. I said we could pass the hat at Elvis'  party and
cough that up...no problem. What do you think? Let Chuck  know:
chuck.paul@a-closer-look.com

Don't forget the attached pictures...you don't want to miss JD's  date.
