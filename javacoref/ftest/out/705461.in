Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is
because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management.
They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The
new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him
next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New
Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in
a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in
Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and
regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is
placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the
partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the
Foundations new CEO........
