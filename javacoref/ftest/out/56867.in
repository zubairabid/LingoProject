Stacey and Ellen:
In light of current circumstances, if a counterparty has both a Master Firm and a GISB, please confirm all firm physical transactions (both telephonic and EOL) under the Master Firm and not the GISB.
Additionally, could one of you provide me a list of EOL counterparties who have a GISB contract listed as their master agreement for EOL.
Thanks,
Jeff
