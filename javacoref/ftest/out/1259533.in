Donna and Shelley,
Fran still needs the spreadsheet we did today broke out by individual.
She is being requested to do this as part of the Dynegy review.
I told her I thought Donna had a master list with everyone on it and
their percent of time to NNG.  I thought that would be better than me just giving her
names so we could ensure to tie back to the summary we did today.
