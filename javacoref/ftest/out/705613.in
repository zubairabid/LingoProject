John, we are working out some issues with the station 1 permit and the EPA
permits for 3 and 4.  Briefly here they are.
First issue, that we did not anticipate from the ADEQ.  It applies to hours
of operation for the generator.  The ADEQ has restricted hours of operation
because we are close to the PSD levels at the facility.  In talking to
Shdeish, the ADEQ protects itself and applies a 10% safety factor on all
applications that approach PSD to ensure that the PSD levels are not
triggered.   This is there policy not regulation.  What is ironic is that
they accepted our calculations for the netting, but did not indicate that
they would apply any safety factor for their comfort.  Im concerned about the
time frame to iron out this issue and the construction start date.  I need
some guidance.  Do we want to spend time fighting this, not knowing how long
it will take to resolve or do we bite the bullet and put on a catlytic
converter for the generator and have unlimited operating hours?  In speaking
with Shudeish, I got the impressions that when an application approaches the
PSD limit, they want to see the applicant apply CEMS or some kind of control
technology just to be sure that they stay under the 250 ton limit.  I know
time is of the essence.
Second issue.  The EPA has given us a pretty good permit for stations 3 and
4, but have restircted us to ppmvd values for NOx and CO, instead of lb./hr
or ton/yr.  The values that they have given us in the permit are OK (25 ppmvd
for NOx and CO) at base load operation. GE will guarantee this.   However, at
lower tempertures and at reduced loads of 60%, the manufactures numbers are
40 ppmvd for NOx and CO.  We cant live with this.  In our application, we
stated that we would be operating at low loads for 20% of the time and we
applied a 15% safety factor for the higher NOx and CO levels and presented
this in lb.hr and tons/yr.  This would have covered us, but because the
permits limits are in ppmvd, we would exceed  these limits during low loads
and low temps.  I have requested from Roger that we would accept permit
conditions that would allow us 40 ppmvd during low temps and low loads with
with requiring us to do associated recordkeeping and Roger said that he would
bring this before his management.  Ill keep you apprised of this issue.
