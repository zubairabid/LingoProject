1.  The cc'd individuals shown above are to be cc'd on each e-mail communication relating to terminations by the counterparties shown below which have not yet terminated. Communication on termination notices coming in should be made as soon as possible after receipt from the counterparty. Please try to assure that any termination notices reaching the 6th floor credit war room are brought to you ASAP for review.  Starting today, those counterparties shown in red may be receiving performance from EPMI on any given day going forward.  To serve our commercial purposes, we are hoping to get the time beween receipt of wholesale power side terminations and their review and internal acknowledgment on your spreadsheet and among the referenced persons reduced to a maximum of 24 hours.
2.  I am confirming back to you that MidAmerican Energy Company has delivered to EPMI a 1-2-02 notice of termination, terminating effective 1-4-02 all wholesale power transactions under its Master Power Purchase & Sale Agreement with EPMI dated 11-13-01. Please reflect this on your next issued spreadsheet.
