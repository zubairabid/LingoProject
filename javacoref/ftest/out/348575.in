Background
At the Napa meeting in December, one of the Working Groups established was
for Knowledge and Information Management.  The group,s mission is to develop
a system for capturing and distributing knowledge and information.  The pilot
version of the group,s efforts is tentatively scheduled to be launched in
September 2000.

Overview
The product is a web based application to store knowledge and information,
initially for Public Affairs as a pilot program, then as a system for all of
Enron.  The system will be populated and maintained by users.  The goal is be
able to find specific data with as few &clicks8 as possible, so data will be
searchable and linkable between documents and topics.  Each document will be
summarized, and will be &sanitized8 to prevent confidential data from being
distributed from the system.  Input to the system will be subject to a review
process.  Documents in the system will include white-papers, presentations,
process histories and/or summaries, articles, links to external sites, and
any other information identified as &knowledge8 through this survey and as
the system evolves that would be valuable to others in the company.  (See
attached diagram.)

Request
For the initial population of the system, we request your assistance in
developing a directory of Public Affairs experts who have specific knowledge
and can best communicate it.  To do so, we ask for your input through the
attached survey.  We will contact the identified experts directly to solicit
their submissions to the system.  Your participation and recommendations are
essential in making this system a shared success.  Thank you in advance for
your support!



Please return your response to Elizabeth Linnell and Ricardo Charvel.  We're
looking for as many responses as possible before July 5 so that we can review
them during our next working group meeting.  Any and all responses will be
appreciated!
