Please find attached a Scope of Services document and a list of projects
which have been implemented with current EES customers.  The Scope of
Services document is designed to show the types of projects, operations and
maintenance, and facilities management services that EESO typically offers to
its customers based on their industry segment.  The projects and services
offered are very similar across segments and customers, but their level of
deployment varies significantly from segment to segment.

Certain segments were grouped together because the EESO offering would
feature similar assets and services.
SIC Codes were given for each segment to represent the types of customers
that comprise each segment.
The list of projects represents general categories from which more specific
projects will be tailored to fit the clients needs.  This project list
represents assets that have been approved by the DSM Desk and was queried
from PCCS.
The Operations and Maintenance services can be applied to any energy-related
assets and was compiled from term sheets and IAM.  Generally those activities
have been limited to a few industrial outsourcing deals including Springs,
Polaroid and recently Eli Lilly.
Facilities Management is usually outsourced via IPT or through the adoption
of existing vendor contracts and can involve repair and maintenance for all
assets.   Generally this type of activity has been focused on the retail/real
estate segment.





Cheryl, pls set up a meeting with Harris, Clayton, Bouillion, Jones and
Kaminski to discuss this and an action plan to develop a liability mitigation
product.  I will re-present the original product concept at the meeting.
Would like to see the meeting take place late next week.

Thanks.

Richard
