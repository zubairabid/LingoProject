Can we get any traction in supporting this?  The premise is obviously
preaching to the choir, and we (as I am sure others do as well) have a string
of proposals starting with SDGEs in May or June that, if we melded their
timing and their prices into the attached timeline would be very damaging to
thinking people.  However, are people really thinking, or has Davis and the
reporters tainted the waters too badly?  What would be the result that we
would like to get from such an exposee?  Do we really think that we could get
some sympathy for returning to a market based structure?  Or, would we be
like the irritating kid who keeps saying "I told you so", so it does not
matter if he was right or not?  Are there any legal issues in revealing the
prices?  Does doing this through IEP help?  (Note that the addition of prices
could not be done, I do not think,  without naming companies, so we would be
there, partially revealed.)
My vote:  if it does not hurt us (competitively, PR, etc.), if it is legal,
and especially if it can help make even a small amout of progress towards a
market based structure, I would do it.  Of course, we could not go anymore to
restaurants near the CPUC......
I am out of town for the rest of the week, so I will leave the decision to
you guys.  Whatever you decide, is OK.
PS - At the very least, we should feed our own proposals and their prices
into this timeline.  Privately, we could show it to various parties on a case
by case basis to advance our cause.  Just think about it...  what if SDGE had
accepted our (and others) May/June proposals for 5.5 cents.....?)
