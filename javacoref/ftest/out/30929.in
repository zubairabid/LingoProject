Update for MDEA:

Entergy transmission has recently revised a few provisions in its tariff which seriously effects our MDEA portfolio. Under the new system, imbalances in the schedule can result in SIGNIFICANT financial implications. For example, we had an imbalance of 18 MW for HE 21 on 10/29/01 which resulted in a $60,000 penalty. We need to work together with GENCO to ensure we meet their requirements on an hour to hour basis.

Steps to take to facilitate this process:

1. Continuously check with GENCO at the top of each hour to verify if generation is required.
2. Complete all transmission requests, OATI tags, in time, to not disrupt the MDEA's needs
3. Continuously search out new resources for electricity to help in case of emergency.
4. Become very familiar with EES transmission, how it works, how to move from point to point, restrictions, time constraints, etc.
5. Be aware of the marketing companies who own generation in EES control area. i.e.. Calpine, PGET, Dynegy, etc.


Any questions, let me know
