Stage Three of the state's Electrical Emergency Plan (EEP) is required when
operating reserves fall below one-and-a-half percent. The California ISO's
EEP is part of the state's enhanced reliability standards created by landmark
legislation Assembly Bill 1890, which restructured California's electricity
industry.

California ISO is charged with managing the flow of electricity along the
long-distance, high-voltage power lines that make up the bulk of California's
transmission system. The not-for-profit public-benefit corporation assumed
the responsibility in March, 1998, when California opened its energy markets
to competition and the state's investor-owned utilities turned their private
transmission power lines over to the California ISO to manage. The mission of
the California ISO is to safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity,
facilitate markets and ensure equal access to a 12,500 circuit mile "electron
highway."
