FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

GOVERNOR DAVIS ORDERS FINANCIAL INCENTIVES FOR BUSINESSES WHO CUT ENERGY USE
Order Calls for Streamlining of Energy Demand Reduction Plans
LOS ANGELES
Governor Gray Davis today signed Executive Order D-39-01, which authorizes
the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to implement voluntary,
emergency load curtailment programs for commercial, industrial or other large
businesses. In exchange for agreeing to reduce electricity usage during power
emergencies, the DWR will offer financial incentives to participating
customers.
"Nearly 70 percent of energy usage in California is commercial," Governor
Davis said. "Commercial load curtailment programs can help mitigate and even
avoid blackouts. Therefore, I am ordering the Department of Water Resources
to implement a program that allows businesses to receive compensation if they
voluntarily agree to reduce their energy consumption during peak periods."
The Governor's order addresses the overlapping and sometimes inconsistent
load curtailment programs currently offered by the California Independent
System Operator, the Public Utilities Commission, and the Investor-Owned
Utilities.
The DWR and the ISO will implement the programs for Summer 2001 and Summer
2002 and the DWR will finance the customer incentives. The incentives will be
determined by a number of factors, including the size of the customer and the
amount of energy to be curtailed. The overall cost for the program, estimated
to be between $50-100 million, will ultimately depend on the number of
customers who sign up.
