Jeff and all:  I agree with your thoughts as to the need for amendments re
DA customers that have never purchased DWR power, call it amend. 1.  I also
agree with your proposal re customers that leave bundled service for direct
access service only having to pay for the costs actually incurred by DWR on
their behalf, call it amend. 2.  I think it is a stretch, however, to
propose an exemption for any customer that leaves bundled for DA by
September 1, call it amend. 3.  This appears to be inconsistent with amend.
2.  I agree with you re amend. 4, deletion of language ending DA.  Bill
