I have been contacted directly from InvaTech regarding Megafill. In
addition, I have seen photos on their website. They currently don't have a
company in southern California providing the service. My expectation is that
this would be applicable to us when we have larger diameter pipe that we have
to grout. However, I doubt that it would be cost-effective for grouting of
service lines, just because of mobilization costs.
The Atlanta Gas Light PCB Research Consortium met in Albany last week, and
UPSCO/Dow Chemical demo-ed their "Foam-Pak 180." This has more possibilities
for us. Although this is more expensive than the aerosol cans that we are
currently using, the high pressure of the "Foam-Pak 180" allows for foam to
be pushed further into the pipe. UPSCO/Dow indicated that their objective
was to be able to push the foam 100 feet into 2" pipe. I plan to explore
this option further to see if the benefits outweigh the added cost. I'll
keep you in the loop.
