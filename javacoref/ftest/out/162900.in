PASADENA, Calif., Oct. 6 -- California's electricity market is not ''workably
competitive'' and needs to be fixed, the California Power Exchange said in a
draft report.
Wholesale power prices from May to July more than quadrupled from a year
earlier as demand strained supplies during weather that was hotter than
normal. Some generators appeared to hold back power at times of peak
consumption, waiting until prices surged.
This happened because of ''structural flaws in the design of the California
electricity markets,'' the report said. ''These design flaws need to be
addressed,'' it said. A final report is expected next week.
The exchange recommended easing restrictions on building power plants and
penalizing companies for waiting until the last minute to deliver power. It
did not cite a specific power-plant owner, marketer or utility as responsible
for the problem.
The nonprofit power exchange was created by the state legislature in 1996 to
operate a marketplace where utilities and other big buyers and sellers could
get electricity.
The PG&E Corporation's Pacific Gas and Electric, Edison International's
Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas and Electric buy
all their power through the exchange.
Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison have said they face
billions of dollars of losses because rates they can charge customers are
frozen far below the rates they had to pay for power on the exchange this
summer.
