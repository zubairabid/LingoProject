Caroline,
In order to try and meet your timing requirements on your other priority deal
I devoted my time at the end of last week to working on identifying
acceptable Anguillan counsel, getting them approved by Jim Derrick and
preparing a derivatives legal survey for counsel, which process can normally
take up to several weeks.  Please note my email sent Friday night for the
update on that project.  My comments on the latest Union Spring comments are
as follows:

With respect to item 1, I have made one slight modification for clarity, that
the new Manager be acceptable "to Party A".
With respect to item 2, I have further modified the tax representation to
conform it to the tax documents the counterparty is able to provide by
removing references to being able to transact from a location within the
United States.
With respect to item 3, I have agreed to their change.
With respect to item 5, we still require an opinion of counsel.
With respect to item 6, the changes are agreed to.
With respect to item 7, as I mentioned to you last time we spoke about Union
Spring, I cannot agree to their ERISA change.  Our outside counsel who is our
expert on these issues does not agree the change is acceptable.  We need a
citation to an applicable statute or regulation that would exempt the
arrangement  from the prohibited transactions prohibitions of ERISA.  You had
indicated you would get them to send their references to a code section so we
could have some new context in which to review the change.  As of now I have
not received any rational or code section references.
With respect to item 8, I have made the change.
All other marked changes not mentioned on the list were agreed to.

Attached please find a revised blackline draft of the Agreement which
incorporates Paul's and my comments.



Regards,
Brent Hendry
