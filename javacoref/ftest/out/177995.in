FOLSOM, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 20, 2001--The California Independent
System Operator (California ISO) declared a Stage Three Electrical Emergency
and called for rotating customer outages beginning at 9:20 a.m., Tuesday,
March 20, 2001.

The California ISO has requested the state's utilities to curtail 500
megawatts affecting both northern and southern California. The extent of the
outages and whether they are anticipated to last the afternoon and into the
evening will be evaluated on an hourly basis. Conservation is strongly urged
today and could easily make the difference in maintaining operating reserves
at a level that could lesson or prevent blackouts.

Specific details will be available at the following media briefings.

More than 12,000 megawatts of generation remain unavailable in the state
due to planned and forced maintenance outages. In addition, half of the
state's Qualifying Facilities (QFs) are not operating because of reported
financial concerns, low wind or an inability to purchase natural gas to run
the plants. QFs are small independent power generators that include biomass
plants, wind farms and photovoltaic (solar) projects.

California ISO anticipates reaching a peak load of 29,952 megawatts this
evening. Earlier a Stage Two Emergency was extended through midnight
tonight. Voluntary load interruption programs were activated this morning.

Stage Three of the state's Electrical Emergency Plan (EEP) is required when
operating reserves fall below one-and-a-half percent. The California ISO's
EEP is part of the state's enhanced reliability standards created by
landmark legislation Assembly Bill 1890, which restructured California's
electricity industry. California ISO is charged with managing the flow of
electricity along the long-distance, high-voltage power lines that make up
the bulk of California's transmission system. The not-for-profit
public-benefit corporation assumed the responsibility in March, 1998, when
California opened its energy markets to competition and the state's
investor-owned utilities turned their private transmission power lines over
to the California ISO to manage. The mission of the California ISO is to
safeguard the reliable delivery of electricity, facilitate markets and
ensure equal access to a 25,526 circuit mile "electron highway." Information
about the California ISO control area's electricity supply and the current
demand is available on the web at . Contact local investor-owned utilities
for information regarding which customers will be affected:
