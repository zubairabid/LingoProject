The attached note is from Enron's hired lobbyist in Sacramento.  Looks like
the only thing that is going to happen will be a Budget without anything on
energy restructuring (could continue to change).
There will be some additional negotiating on SBX2 78 over the recess.  Enron
is looking for a way into those discussions (Jeff Dasovich).  We will try to
push good language on DA dates and assignment of Utility and CDWR costs.
On another note, CDWR has announced its revenue requirements going forward.
The numbers are significantly less than had previously been expected (due to
lower costs for spot market purchases).  The end result, if their figures are
correct, is that the March 27 3c/kwh increase would be sufficient going
forward (we are trying to validate).  The key is that now the Retained
Generation proceedings will determine if any more $ is needed from retail
customers.
Thanks,
Jim
