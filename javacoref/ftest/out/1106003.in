Sara:
I have followed up with Brent and he is working on the Entergy-Koch amendment for CommodityLogic.  He cannot commit to a completion date at this time since he has some other priorities.  I've asked for Friday and he has indicated that may be aggressive.  The sales team is presenting Entergy-Koch the CommodityLogic legal agreements today (ESA, Password application, Subscription Agreement).  In light of this, can you provide a status of where the other 18 customer amendments are (excluding Sempra and Entergy-Koch) ?  The Sales process is moving along and we will need to have these amendments ready to present to the customer soon.  Could you go through the list and provide an estimate date of when a draft of the amendment would be available by client.  We need to provide a status to management on Monday 10/8.
Per our conversation today, if there is a way to focus on the creation of a template that addresses the confirmation exchange via electronic systems (e.g. ConfirmLogic) that can be shared earlier with the clients.  The additional language that is deemed necessary can be added to this form as needed per counterparty.  This will allow us to achieve getting something to the client so they can start the process from their side while we continue to shore up what language needs to be added.  We still need to be thinking of how to keep this process simple to allow quick turnaround yet satisfy the legal requirements for confirmations.  I ask that you and Leslie continue to help define a better process for us and I will continue to work with Kim and the sales team to implement this process.
