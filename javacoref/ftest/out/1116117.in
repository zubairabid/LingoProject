WHAT TO DO IF YOU LOSE YOUR PURSE OR WALLET
We've all heard horror stories about fraud that's committed in your  name,address, SS#, credit, etc. Unfortunately I (the author of this piece who  happens to be an attorney) have first-hand knowledge, because my wallet was  stolen last month and within a week the thieves ordered an expensive monthly  cell phone package, applied for a VISA credit card, had a credit line approved  to buy a Gateway computer, received a PIN number from DMV to change my driving  record information online, and more.
But here's some critical information to limit the damage in case this  happens to you or someone you know. As everyone always advises, cancel your  credit cards immediately, but the key is having the toll free numbers and your  card numbers handy so you know whom to call. Keep those where you can find them  easily. File a police report immediately in the jurisdiction where it was  stolen, this proves to credit providers you were diligent, and is a first step  toward an investigation (if there ever is one).
But here's what is perhaps most important: (I never ever thought to do  this.)
Call the three national credit reporting organizations immediately to place  a fraud alert on your name and SS#. I had never heard of doing that until  advised by a bank that called to tell me and application for credit was made  over the Internet in my name. The alert means any company that checks your  credit knows your information was stolen and they have to contact you by phone  to authorize new credit. By the time I was advised to do this, almost 2 weeks  after the theft, all the damage had been done. There are records of all the  credit checks initiated by the thieves' purchases, none of which I knew about  before placing the alert.
Since then, no additional damage has been done, and the thieves threw my  wallet away this weekend (someone turned it in). It seems to have stopped them  in their tracks.
The numbers are:
Equifax: 1-800-525-6285
Experian (formerly TRW): 1-888-397-3742
Trans Union: 1-800-680-7289
Social Security Administration (fraud line): 1-800-269-0271
We  pass along jokes; we pass along just about everything. Do think about passing  this information along. It could really help someone.
