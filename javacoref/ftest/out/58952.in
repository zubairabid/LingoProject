Further to my previous email, Competition Act Canada and Investment Canada Act approvals are currently contemplated as conditions to closing.

We (ECC) have provided UBS and its counsel with all information and warranties that they need to convince themselves that no pre-closing approvals are needed in the circumstances (they only need to make a post-closing notification), but it is ultimately their decision, and we have yet to hear back from their counsel, although we don't anticipate any problem.
