Senate Energy is going to meet tomorrow to take up the following bills,
all of which are in spot format:

SBX2 41 (Speier) The bill would require the CPUC to also take into
account the number of inhabitants located at the site of a residential
customer, and increase baseline quantities accordingly, up to an
unspecified maximum number of inhabitants.

SBX2 68 (Battin) The bill would require the ISO to take into account the
general well being of residents in a particular area to determine the
feasibility of blackouts.

SBX2 73 (Alpert) The bill would find and declare that where
cost-effective electric supply cannot be secured by the Independent
System Operator or the state, any system outages should be managed so as
to minimize disruption to the customers.  This bill would require the
Governor, if cost-effective electric supply cannot be secured by the ISO
or the state, in collaboration with certain entities, to establish
certain purchasing guidelines and to create a system of managing any
interruptions in a manner so as to minimize disruption to the
customers.  This bill would also require the commission to create
interruptibility programs in which larger customers or communities
desiring higher levels of reliability may secure that reliability in
exchange for fees established by the commission.  The bill would require
the programs to require public utility electrical corporations to
configure their distribution so that selective and identifiable blocks
of customers can be provided differing levels of reliability, and to
alert customers of potential outages.

Following the bill hearing, the Committee is going to have an
informational hearing entitled:

"The Impacts of Creating An Energy Buyer's Cartel"
