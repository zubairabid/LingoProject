Everyone,

This is what CGI forwarded me this morning with regards to a potential
partnering agreement with Enron to respond to the RFP sent out for
development of Back-Office systems.  The idea is for us to license our
"source-code' for the mid/back-office technology to CGI, who will then tweak
it to build a system for their customers.  At this point in time, we have not
made any commitments, whatsoever, and are planning to do so only if this can
be done with minimal hand-holding from us (given our other project
commitments).

Please read through the Teaming Agreement at your earliest so we can all
discuss any revisions you may want made.

As CGI will be responding to this RFP today with potential support from ENW
(i.e. our code would be one of the key selling points), they had requested
some basic information on Enron, which we provided to them late last week.
This will be bundled with company specific information for CGI, that will be
provided as part of the Response to RFP.




Beth, I've also left a message for you with Blanca.  Lets talk when you get a
chance so we can discuss this and other things sometime today.

Regards,
Rahil
