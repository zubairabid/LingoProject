Thanks Roger.  Here are the highlights of today's hearings:
Common themes--many tracked ours pretty closely
Not a question of whether rates need to rise, but by how much.
Though some oppose any and all rate increases, the lion's share acknowledged
that the utilities have a cash flow problem and the a rate increase is
necessary.
Due process matters.
If the Commission is thinking about going as far as ending rate freezes and
increasing rates, it better provide for ample due process, or countless law
suits will ensue.
Don't jump the gun.
A rate increase is likely, but only the utilities benefit from adoption of
the utilities' proposals. The Commission needs to carefully scrutinize the
utilities' claims and take a careful look at the level of increase required
to maintain access to capital markets.  However, as expected, the utilities
implored the Commission to jump the gun immediately.  The utilities want the
Commission to declare an end to the rate freeze and raise rates on Jan.4.
No more divestiture.
The utility should keep the generating assets it retained, but the Commission
should ensure that the assets' benefits are allocated equally among all
customers.  One legislator recommended that the State buy the utilities'
hydro assets, which would give the utilities the cash they need and give the
state control over some generation.
Treat all customers equally and fairly.
The Commission should not create two classes of customers (e.g., large v.
small; direct access v. bundled).  No customer group should be sacrificied to
save another.
Be as narrow as possible/do as little harm as possible
The immediate problem is the utility's cash/credit crunch.  As such, the
Commission should do only enough to solve this very specific, immediate
problem.  A modest rate increase is all that's required and the Commission
should do no more.
At the beginning and the end of the hearing, the President of the Commission
asked parties to be prepared (at tomorrow's hearing) to discuss whether the
Commission could legally use its other, broad powers to raise rates without
declaring an end to the rate freeze.  It seems that she seems some benefit in
raising rates, but leaving AB 1890 otherwise intact untill the Commission can
Marketers and generators are to blame for the problem
Though not universally embraced, the theme came up repeatedly.
A few parties (e.g., the Unions, low income consumer groups, one PUC
commissioner) called for complete re-regulation of the industry, returning
the utilities to vertically integrated monopolies.  But they were the
exception rather than the rule at today's hearing.
2. Next steps
There hearings were scheduled to end on Thursay, but now will continue
through Friday.
Tomorrow, lawyers will provide "oral" arguments on whether the Commission
must end the rate freeze in order to increase rates.  We will argue that it
does not have to, and should not, go through the complex and controversial
exercise of determing whether the rate freeze is over between now and
01.04.01.  We will argue that the Commission has the authority to raise rates
without ending the rate freeze, and if it decides to raise rates, it should
do so while keeping AB 1890's basic structure in place until a full and fair
hearing of the issues is completed.   We are talking to other stakeholders to
persuade them to take the same approach.  In terms of legal arguments, this
is clearly a long shot, but one that seems worth taking.
After the oral argument, the utilities will present their rate proposals and
"all interested persons" will have the opportunity to cross-examine the
utilities (in short, tomorrow will also be a zoo).
When asked what the process will be for issuing a proposed decision and
providing comments, the President of the Commission responded "we don't know,
it's evolving."  In other words, the Commission is doing a poor job of
ensuring that their Jan 4 decision is "appeal-proof."
Keep in mind that the situation remains extremely fluid and the trend is
still toward ending the rate freeze on Jan. 4th.  We continue to aggressively
offer alternatives to that possibility and continue to try to bring other
stakeholders to our side.
We're doing everything necessary to preserve our appeal rights.
We can discuss further on the 10 AM (CST) call tomorrow.
