Jeff,

Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!
