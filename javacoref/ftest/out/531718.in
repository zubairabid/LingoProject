Weather an early test for fee caps: Any severe jump in prices will likely be
curbed, experts say.
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 20, 2001)
California electricity prices have shot back up recently, potentially posing
an early test of a new federal price-control plan that takes effect today.
Warm weather has sent wholesale prices doubling this week, partially
reversing a dramatic slide that had some state officials believing they'd
tamed the wildly unpredictable California electricity market.
The rebound in prices "would be expected," said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of
the California Energy Markets newsletter. "It's 110 degrees in Phoenix, and
it's 100 degrees (in Sacramento) and points in between."
Prices this week moved back above $100 a megawatt hour, about double what
they were last week -- although well below the roughly $300 suppliers were
charging California in mid-May. Prices showed signs of stabilizing Tuesday,
analysts said.
Experts said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new price-mitigation
plan is likely to curb the most severe price spikes. "This will eliminate the
astronomical prices," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of
California Energy Institute.
But the plan probably won't bring California a cascade of cheap power,
either.
Prices likely will bump up constantly against FERC's new price caps, which
will fluctuate from time to time, and they're not likely to go much below the
caps unless there's a significant glut of energy, said Peter Stiffler of the
energy consulting firm Economic Insight Inc.
"Traders will always trade in at the price ceiling," Stiffler said. "They're
going to offer power at the highest price they can."
The fluctuating FERC caps are tied to the production costs of the
least-efficient, most-expensive generating plant operating in California when
supplies are tight and an official "power alert" is declared by the state's
Independent System Operator, which runs most of the power grid. When there
isn't a power alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the price established
during the most recent alert.
FERC said the system would begin today with a cap of $108.49 a megawatt hour
but would rise to $127.64 if a power alert is declared.
But the cap can fluctuate significantly. Under the old FERC plan, the price
cap in May was set at $267 a megawatt hour. The old plan was similar to the
new system but applied only to California and only kicked in during power
alerts.
With the caps flexible, generators could have incentives to withhold power at
some plants in order to raise the caps, said Stanford University economist
Frank Wolak.
The FERC plan "still doesn't solve the problem of withholding," said Wolak,
chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee.
Wolak also said he's afraid FERC will let power generators exaggerate their
costs in order to bump up the caps.
"The good news is, they seem to be more serious," Wolak said of the
oft-criticized commissioners. "But given how many times we've been taken in,
I'm wary."
In addition, generators will be allowed to exceed the price caps if they can
justify it to FERC officials. Borenstein said FERC in the past has allowed
generators to justify just about every price level imaginable, and he's
suspicious that the commission will let generators do the same in order to
evade the new price controls.
State officials, while cautiously optimistic about the plan, were upset that
FERC will allow a 10 percent price premium on electricity because of the risk
of selling to the California market.
"We recognize that the risk of nonpayment in California continues to be
greater" than in other states, the commission said in its written opinion,
released late Tuesday.
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the premium ludicrous
because the state Department of Water Resources has been buying electricity
ever since the state's troubled utilities exhausted their credit in
mid-January.
"The state is as creditworthy a buyer as you can get," Maviglio said.
Experts said the plan also won't correct the state's energy imbalance.
"None of this is going to have much effect on blackouts," Borenstein said.
"This is solving part of the problem; I'm worried people will think
everything has been solved.
"The emphasis now has to be on getting California to conserve," he added.
A spokesman for power generators, Gary Ackerman, said the price controls
could worsen shortages this summer and will discourage generating firms from
investing in the new power plants the West desperately needs.
Builders "are going to sit on the fence and think about this," said Ackerman,
head of the Western Power Trading Forum.
Acting in the face of mounting political pressure and unrelenting criticism
from California, FERC voted Monday to impose round-the-clock price controls
throughout the 11-state Western region.
The FERC plan replaces a three-week-old plan that applied only to California
and took effect only when power reserves fell to below 7 percent of demand
and an official "power alert" was declared.
By extending the plan to the entire West, experts said the commission
probably put an end to the phenomenon known as "megawatt laundering," in
which power was shipped out of California and then re-imported. Imported
power wasn't subject to the old price controls.
The new controls, said consultant Stiffler, "significantly narrow the ability
of a trader to move power around and play the market."

State to borrow up to $5 billion to buy energy
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 20, 2001)
State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced Tuesday that he will borrow up to $5
billion to pay for future power purchases, a move he said was necessary to
avoid a continued drain on California's budget and cuts in other state
programs.
Since mid-January, energy purchased by the state Department of Water
Resources on the spot market and under long-term contracts has come out of
the state's general fund, the source of most state spending.
Once the loan becomes final by the end of next week, however, energy will be
purchased with the proceeds.
Made possible by an emergency order from the governor, the loan ultimately
will be paid off by customers of the state's investor-owned utilities through
their electricity rates.
"In essence, it stops the general fund bleeding," Angelides said.
The state has so far committed $8.2 billion from the general fund to
electricity purchases. Of that amount, Angelides said the Department of Water
Resources has actually spent about $6.1 billion through June 12 on power
purchases, and has received about $900 million back from customers'
electricity rates.
Officials expect the loan to finance power purchases through September, when
they plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in revenue bonds.
The bonds will reimburse the general fund and and pay off the loan.
"This gives the state some more running room, some more cushion in case
anything goes awry with the bond sale to make sure ... the state does not run
out of general fund money, jeopardizing education programs, law enforcement
programs, children's and health services," the Democratic treasurer said.
Angelides said he has obtained firm commitments for $3.5 billion from JP
Morgan and Lehman Brothers at a blended interest rate of about 4.5 percent.
If the long-term bonds are not issued by Oct. 31, the interest rate would
climb to about 7 percent.
Lawmakers initially had hoped to close the short-term loan in May and float
the long-term bonds shortly thereafter. However, Republicans in the state
Legislature balked at the plan, forcing the delay of the bond sale until
mid-August.
Rather than wait, Gov. Gray Davis invoked his emergency powers to allow for
the loan and circumvent the delay.
Assembly Republicans don't mind that the governor used his emergency powers
to expedite the loan, said James Fisfis, a spokesman for the caucus. Instead,
he said, they're concerned the loan could backfire and hurt Californians.
"If the larger bond offering falls through, the penalties and added interest
could add up on ratepayers' bills," he said.
But Angelides argued that the loan would benefit ratepayers on several
fronts: Power generators can no longer argue the state should pay a "credit
premium" on electricity, he said, and for the most part will not be able to
walk away from long-term energy contracts that have provisions requiring the
Department of Water Resources to obtain external financing by July 1.
Outside the Legislature, the announcement drew praise from financial analysts
who had criticized the state for buying power with taxpayer money.
In late April, for instance, Standard & Poor cited fears over the state's
mounting power costs when it downgraded California's credit rating on state
bonds.
But S&P managing director Steven Zimmermann called the governor's executive
order a step in the right direction.
"We're very happy," Zimmermann said. "We were very anxious for the state to
take the general fund out of the energy purchasing position it's been in."

Dan Walters: Once burned, lawmakers are very wary of Davis-Edison agreement


(Published June 20, 2001)
The Capitol's politicians rarely attempt to resolve big, complicated policy
issues, preferring to occupy their time with relatively trivial matters --
which also tend to be the priorities of well-heeled and generous interest
groups.
And when they even acknowledge a need to address something big, they'll often
just nibble at the edges rather than confront the underlying conflicts
squarely. That's been the pattern on water, transportation, population growth
and public education, to name but a few of many examples.
The Capitol completed just one comprehensive, or seemingly comprehensive, bit
of policymaking during the last quarter-century. But the issue on that
occasion was electric utility deregulation, which has exploded into an energy
crisis of monumental proportions. And that experience is having a paralyzing
effect on the Capitol's denizens.
Some Capitol old-timers call it "1890 disease," named after the number of the
1996 bill that created California's fatally flawed system of pricing electric
power. The legislation was written largely by lobbyists for affected interest
groups and then presented to the full Legislature for take-it-or-leave-it
approval. The measure was passed without a single dissenting vote, even
though only a few lawmakers even began to understand its ramifications.
It was a huge failure of the legislative process, virtually a dereliction of
duty, and those who participated have been doing some fancy explaining. But
given the history, both veteran legislators and those who came to the Capitol
after 1996 are very leery about putting their names on additional pieces of
energy policy that could backfire if the real-world outcome is markedly
different from the purported effects.
One example is the $43 billion in long-term energy supply contracts
negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis' administration to end the state's dependence
on volatile spot market prices. When the long-term contracting program was
authorized by the Legislature early this year, it was on the assurances of
the administration that it could obtain large quantities of power at cheap
prices. But by the time that the contracts were made final, months later, the
average price was 25 percent higher than what was stated earlier, while the
spot market had fallen dramatically. Now the long-term contracts that seemed
like such a good idea in January and February could become financial
albatrosses.
An even more telling example is the deal Davis made with Southern California
Edison to keep the utility from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in
bankruptcy. The utilities accumulated at least $13 billion in debts in six
months, buying power at prices much higher than they were allowed to
recapture from their customers. Consumer groups are denouncing the Edison
deal as a corporate bailout that would impose multibillion-dollar burdens on
customers while imposing virtually no financial onus on Edison or its
creditors. And the deal's critics are pouncing on legislators' reluctance to
do something that might haunt them later -- especially in 2002, a critical
election year.
"Five years ago, lawmakers and the utilities foolishly foisted this
deregulation scheme onto California consumers, and now the governor and
Edison expect the ratepayers to pay billions more to save the utilities from
their own mismanagement and bad policy decisions," consumer gadfly Harvey
Rosenfield said Tuesday as legislative hearings opened on the Edison deal.
"This time, the whole world is watching the Legislature."
Harry Snyder of Consumers Union echoed Rosenfield's pledge to hold
legislators accountable. "It looks a lot like 1890," Snyder said. "It's too
big, (and) this is the same process all over again."
The sheer complexity and potential ramifications of the deal are weighing
heavily on lawmakers. "This is not a Mother's Day resolution," Senate Energy
Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen said wryly as the hearings began. Davis and
Edison lobbyists are pulling out all the stops, but legislators are very,
very nervous about taking another big step that could generate public
backlash.

Senate Democrats lay back to see if FERC action provides rate relief



By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 19, 2001
WASHINGTON ) Key Senate Democrats called a truce Tuesday in the political
wars raging over California's energy crisis, as they adopted a wait-and-see
posture over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's latest order
restricting electricity prices across much of the West.
Senators of both parties expressed relief over FERC's action on Monday. But
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she was skeptical that the order would
end wholesale price manipulation by power providers or result in refunds to
overcharged ratepayers.
Feinstein and Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., have prepared legislation seeking a
much tighter pricing formula than the one FERC used. But she asked that their
bill be set aside temporarily in deference to the agency's action.
"I think we should wait and see what happens," Feinstein said during a Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on the FERC order.
Democrats on the committee pressed FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert and the
four other commissioners on why they had not acted sooner to control the
daily price turbulence in the California energy market. A market-intervention
order issued by FERC in April was designed to cope only with energy-supply
emergencies, despite pleas by California Gov. Gray Davis and other California
Democrats for more drastic measures.
"It's time to stop blaming and start problem-solving," said Hebert, a
Republican appointed chairman by President Bush.
Hebert noted that electricity prices on the volatile spot market have dropped
considerably since the April order. Prices on the energy futures market have
also tumbled, as have natural gas prices ) a key component in the cost of
electricity.
On Monday, FERC unanimously ordered around-the-clock restraints on wholesale
electricity prices in California and 10 neighboring states over the next 15
months.
As was the case with the April measure, prices will be pegged to the costs of
the least efficient power provider when reserves in California fall below 7
percent. But when reserves are more plentiful, the prices will drop to 85
percent of the level established during supply shortages.
The order also provides for a 22-day period, involving arbitration and review
by an administrative law judge, for resolving price-gouging allegations and
providing refunds in cases of improper pricing.
Adamantly opposing price controls earlier, FERC acted after coming under
intense pressure from lawmakers of both parties. Republicans said they were
worried that their GOP colleagues in California would have been blamed and
possibly imperiled at the polls if FERC had failed to act.
Bush, who also took a hard line against price caps, blessed FERC's action
after it was taken.
Hebert criticized the bill advanced by Feinstein and Smith as an attempt to
solve California's problem by "bureaucratic fiat."
Their measure would calculate wholesale electricity prices based on the
reported production costs of the individual generators, with an added
allowance for a profit margin.
Hebert argued that the "mitigation price" that FERC will establish "is not a
blunt, arbitrary figure that bears no resemblance to market conditions and is
subject to political pressures and whims."
Meanwhile, Commissioner William Massey made it clear that he harbors
misgivings about the FERC measure, although he supported it.
He said the agency should have acted earlier to avoid the subsequent
"carnage" in California, has failed to provide guidelines that would assure
refunds to overcharged consumers and has acted questionably in allowing power
providers to impose a 10-percent surcharge to cover credit-worthiness risks.
Massey, a Democrat who has consistently criticized his colleagues for moving
too slowing in the California crisis, also said he wondered whether the order
would provide an unintended incentive for generators to continue using
inefficient units in order to assure higher profit margins for their more
modern facilities.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she would propose legislation later this
week designed to assure refunds to customers who have had to pay unfair
prices for their electricity.
"If FERC won't do it ... Congress should," Boxer said.
A spokesman for Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the committee, said
Bingaman agreed with Feinstein on the need for a time-out while the FERC
order is being implemented.
Gov. Davis will testify today (6/20) before the Senate Government Affairs
Committee, which is investigating FERC's role in the crisis. Hebert and the
other commissioners will also appear.






House panel erases Bush energy cuts



By Alan Fram
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 19, 2001
WASHINGTON ) A House subcommittee voted Tuesday to spend $1.2 billion more
next year than President Bush proposed for energy and water programs,
underlining lawmakers' sensitivity to the West's power problems and their
desire for home-district projects.
The $23.7 billion measure, approved by voice vote by a panel of the House
Appropriations Committee, is normally one of the more routine of the 13
annual spending measures Congress must approve. But with this year's
escalating battle between Bush and Democrats over energy policy, the
measure's profile has been raised.
The bill would provide $18.7 billion for the Energy Department, $641 million
more than Bush requested and $444 million more than this year. Fiscal 2002,
which the bill covers, begins Oct. 1.
It also includes nearly $4.5 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers and the
hundreds of water projects it has under way across the country, $568 million
more than Bush proposed but $73 million less than this year.
The measure was approved shortly after top members of the committee met with
Bush at the White House.
Participants said Bush and the lawmakers reaffirmed their goal of keeping the
price tag of the 13 bills to $661 billion, which is one-third of the overall
federal budget. That would be a 4 percent boost over 2001, which many
Democrats ) and some Republicans in private ) say is too low.
"He said there would be attempts to raise this as we go through the process,
and let's stick with him," said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the
energy and water subcommittee.
Illustrating the pressures Republicans face, David Sirota, spokesman for the
Democrats on the committee, said the bill lacked the new spending needed for
renewable energy and other programs that could help alleviate power
shortages.
Under the bill approved Tuesday, renewable energy programs would get $377
million, $100 million more than Bush wanted and $1 million more than this
year. Nuclear energy, basic energy sciences, biological and environmental
research and a study of whether spent nuclear fuel should be stored at a
Nevada site would all get about what Bush proposed.
The bill's $7.03 billion for environmental cleanups is $699 million more than
Bush proposed. Programs aimed at containing the nuclear arsenals of former
Soviet states would get $845 million, $71 million more than Bush's plan.
Members voted to hold the brief meeting behind closed doors after citing the
national security sensitivity of publicly discussing some of the nuclear
weapons programs covered by the bill.






Davis, Regulators Face Off at Hearing

From Reuters

WASHINGTON -- California Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, today blamed a
Republican-led energy regulatory agency for not doing enough to help his
energy-starved state and demanded refunds of $6.7 billion for alleged
price-gouging by power generators.
Davis, whose political future has been linked to his state's electricity
woes, was testifying at a Senate hearing with members of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.
The hearing marked the first time that Davis met face to face with all
five FERC commissioners.
FERC regulates interstate electricity markets and has jurisdiction to
order refunds by power generators found to have overcharged utilities.
Earlier this week the agency, led by a Republican majority, rejected
Davis' pleas for strict caps on prices that soared above $400 per megawatt
hour last month.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee,
heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that quizzed the FERC
commissioners and Davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic Western
electricity market.
Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged
price-gouging by out-of-state generators.
"To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to
Californians," Davis said. "It is unconscionable for the generators to profit
from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law
and order the energy companies to give back the money."
Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.
California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,
power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitive
market would warrant, he said.
California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a series
of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economic
slowdown since the power crisis began last year.
The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate
whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or
exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators
deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply
shortages.
Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded "price mitigation"
program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price
limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had
previously applied only to California during emergency power outages.
Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a
legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,
California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on a
package of energy amendments, including a price cap.
The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,
contending they would discourage more power production.
Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that
supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not help,
California.
The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts
this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at
$150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would
shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on production
costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of
capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study.
However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some
kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the
congressional elections next year.
The FERC plan expands an existing "price mitigation" program in
California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through September
2002, means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power
cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a Stage 1
power shortage emergency in California.
A Stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7
percent of demand on the Western power grid.
The plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into
California as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the
state's financially weak utilities.
Davis was due to meet the two newest FERC commissioners, Patrick Wood of
Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, today. Both are former utilities
regulators in states that successfully deregulated their power industry and
nominated to the agency by President Bush.

NEWS ANALYSIS
Energy on Agenda, but Issue Is Blame
Politics: Gov. Davis will try to sway voter anger toward the GOP as he faces
a Senate panel.

By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Political Writer

WASHINGTON--When California Gov. Gray Davis testifies at a high-profile
Senate hearing today, the issue formally on the table will be the expanded
electricity price controls that federal regulators approved this week. But
the session's political subtext will be the escalating struggle between Davis
and national Republicans to determine where California voters look for
solutions--and blame--for the state's power woes.
In both California and Washington, Republican strategists believe Davis
is trying to manufacture a succession of conflicts with the White House that
will allow him to run in 2002 as much against President Bush as against
whomever the state GOP nominates in the gubernatorial race. In return,
Republicans are trying to shift the focus back toward Davis--most
aggressively through a California-wide television advertising campaign
organized by Scott Reed, a former executive director of the Republican
National Committee.
"Our goal is to get the focus back to Sacramento, where it belongs,"
Reed said.
Both sides see the same prize in this tug of war: the opportunity to
determine where most Californians direct their anger during what could be a
long, hot summer of power shortages.
"The situation is that the public's minds are not made up on this
issue--whether it is Sacramento or Washington who has acted too little, too
late," said Mark Baldassare, a pollster at the independent Public Policy
Institute of California. "That gives both sides an opportunity to get their
messages out. The stakes are fairly high in terms of how the public in
California ends up assessing blame over the next few months."

A Slight Uptick in Davis' Popularity
Overall, Davis' political situation appears to be stabilizing. After
months of runaway power costs, the prices the state pays for wholesale
electricity are falling and new plants will come online next month. And
following a free fall in private polls, Davis has seen his numbers tick back
up slightly. Similarly, a poll financed by independent power generators
showed that in mid-June, for the first time in months, Californians were
becoming slightly more confident that the crisis is easing.
Within the state Capitol, Davis is asserting himself, demanding that
lawmakers hold hearings on his rescue plan for Southern California Edison. On
Monday, he released details of a similar plan for San Diego Gas & Electric.
Last week, he announced an agreement that is likely to increase generation by
alternative energy producers, who account for about a fourth of the state's
supply.
"This guy is changing," said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who a
few months back had been urging that Davis take a more aggressive stance on
the crisis. "There is a difference in his demeanor and focus."
Yet the energy crisis still looms as a vast cloud over a reelection
campaign that once looked like a stroll on the beach.
The paradox for Davis is that the substantive victory for pricecontrol
advocates at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting this week may
complicate his political goal of maintaining a heavy focus on Washington.
Though Davis and some congressional Democrats portrayed FERC's decision as
insufficient, it appears to have lanced the pressure for federal legislation
to impose the tighter price controls that Davis supports.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a principal sponsor of that bill, on
Tuesday announced she would shelve the measure for six months to give the new
FERC plan time to work.
As a result, the political effect of the FERC ruling could be to shift
the focus away from Washington back toward decisions in Sacramento, which is
exactly what Republicans prefer. "Gray Davis is the dog that finally caught
the car," said Dan Schnur, a San Francisco-based GOP consultant. "Davis is
going to keep screaming about price caps and refunds, but now Republicans can
point to substantive action."

Davis: 'Much More They Should Do'
For months, Davis has criticized Bush for refusing to support
electricity price controls and other measures that the governor says could
ease California's energy crunch. At almost every opportunity, Davis offers
the same message: California is taking the steps it needs to, but Washington
has failed to help enough. That was precisely Davis' message Monday when FERC
significantly expanded the limited price caps it had imposed previously.
While saying that FERC had "finally taken a step in the right
direction," Davis added: "There is much more they should do"--including
providing refunds to California for alleged overcharges. The overall tone of
Davis' statement was much more skeptical about FERC's action than the remarks
from Feinstein, who described the decision as "a giant step forward."
Aides say Davis plans to repeat that two-part message in his appearance
today before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). In his testimony, and in a round of scheduled
television appearances, Davis will demand that FERC order refunds in the
range of $5 billion to $6 billion to the state, aides said. Davis also will
distribute to every member of Congress a 177-page book chronicling the
state's response to the crisis.
Inside the Bush White House, some officials see in Davis' cool response
to FERC's decision more evidence that the governor is determined to use the
White House as a foil in his reelection campaign. The prevailing view, one
official said, is that, no matter what concessions the administration offers,
Davis will immediately raise the bar and demand something else--the way he
did by talking about rebates as soon as FERC offered tougher price controls.
"That is Davis' M.O.," said one official involved in the White House's
energy strategy. "He asks the administration to do something, the
administration does it, and then he attacks the administration for not doing
enough. . . . He needs someone to blame."
Davis aides reject that characterization, arguing that the governor is
merely representing the state's interests against an administration that they
maintain is favoring energy producers over consumers. But Davis advisors
acknowledge that they have used focus groups to test campaign messages that
pin the blame for the energy crunch primarily on Davis' Republican
predecessor, Pete Wilson, and a "Republican president who has failed to stop
his rich friends in the energy industry" from gouging consumers, one aide
said.
"You don't have to tell people in focus groups more than once how this
is connected," the Davis aide said.

Gubernatorial Rivals Are Free of Blame
Baldassare, the independent pollster, notes it may be especially
imperative for Davis to keep Bush's energy decisions in the spotlight because
none of his potential Republican opponents in 2002--California Secretary of
State Bill Jones, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan or businessman
William E. Simon Jr.--is easily tagged with complicity in the problem. "None
of them were really involved in the decision-making over deregulation,"
Baldassare said. "The only one else to blame, in a political sense, is
Washington and the Bush administration."
The new independent advertising campaign against Davis was inspired
largely by the fear of that strategy succeeding--damaging the standing in
California not only of Bush but also of other Republicans, particularly those
in Congress. Reed, whose American Taxpayers Alliance is funding the ads, said
he decided to launch the campaign after Davis appeared to gain the upper hand
in the media debate following Bush's visit to California late last month.
"The Bush trip really changed the terms of debate about Davis' problem
and made it more of a possible national Republican problem," Reed said. "The
entire terms of debate turned around and was focused on the issue of price
caps as opposed to negligence on Davis' behalf. Our group is attempting to go
out and engage Davis."
To "engage" Davis, Reed's group, which has not revealed its donors, is
spending what he said would be $1.5 million on an initial ad criticizing
Davis this week, though a spot check of TV stations around the state
indicated a far more modest buy. Reed said the group is planning to air a new
ad as soon as this week.
Democrats plan to answer the ads with attacks of their own and will be
filing complaints with the IRS and other federal agencies about the anonymous
funding of the Reed ad.
Today's Senate hearing will give Davis another chance to respond to the
GOP and make his case for greater help from Washington. But Lieberman aides
acknowledge the hearing is likely to be much less confrontational than it
would have been if FERC had not acted Monday. The agency's decision "changed
the dynamic," the aide said.
That assessment may apply not only to the conflict between FERC and its
critics but also equally to the hostilities between Davis and the White House.

Blackout Forecasts' Dark Side
If optimists are wrong and the power runs out, California's energy crisis
could quickly cost lives and cripple the economy.

By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer

It's here. Summer 2001, the blackout season, is only a day away.
Already Californians anticipate power outages when temperatures rise. By
August, the occasional annoyances endured so far--stoplights gone dark,
computers, air conditioners and elevators idled--could seem almost quaint.
Gov. Gray Davis insists we needn't worry. Four large new power plants
are firing up soon, he said, and government's best and brightest are locking
up still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need. Californians,
Davis predicts, will valiantly heed his call to conserve, helping the state
survive the hot months, no sweat.
With luck, he'll be right. Power prices have stabilized, and some energy
analysts are wondering whether California may have tamed the blackout beast.
But what if those plants don't get built in time, people don't trim
their electricity use 7% and energy imports are more meager than expected?
And what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot,
as Davis bets, but blistering, record-setting hot?
Government experts who ponder such questions don't expect disaster in
the coming months. But they are planning for it nonetheless.
At best, they say, Californians can expect some gridlocked
intersections, an occasionally overloaded 911 system, perhaps some business
bankruptcies, certainly inconvenience. At worst, the Western power grid could
crash, causing uncontrolled blackouts that might lead to looting,
contaminated water supplies, even civil unrest.
"How bad could this summer get?" said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana).
"This summer could be the worst disaster to ever hit the state of California."
Imagine it's a Thursday morning in the third week of July. Relentless
heat grips California, the curse of a stubborn high-pressure ridge that just
won't budge.
As air conditioners from Redding to Chula Vista lumber to life, managers
of the state's power grid in Folsom gulp their third and fourth cups of
coffee, stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret.
Demand is jumping. Supply is static, Canada and Arizona have nothing to
sell. It's looking tight.
Thirty minutes later, the picture is gloomier. A brush fire shuts down
transmission lines near Fresno, squeezing supply in the Central Valley. In
the Bay Area, the unusual heat drives demand well past projections.
By noon things look bleak. Operators of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power
plant near San Luis Obispo have cut output by 80%. The trouble? Chunks of
kelp have lodged in one of the plant's seawater intake valves, creating a
clog like one that plagued the facility in January.
With a chorus of groans, the grid's keepers scour the market for power
to offset the Diablo loss. No luck. As the mercury climbs and the Golden
State economy roars into full swing, electricity consumption ticks upward,
minute by minute. And when managers of a power plant near Long Beach cut
output because of a cracked turbine, everyone knows what it means.
Alert the utilities. It's lights out, California, for the fourth day in
a row.
Dr. J. Michael Leary dreads blackouts--not personally, but
professionally. Leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of
Rancho Mirage. When air conditioners go on the blink there, the
victims--scores of them, mostly old folks--wind up in his ER.
In a normal year, 75% of his emergency patients are geriatrics. Like
infants, the elderly are unusually vulnerable to the heat. When blackouts
hit, they are most at risk.
"It's as if you lived in Maine and they turned the heat off in January,"
Leary said. "This is an extreme environment we live in. The effects can be
devastating."
Many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes, some
of them poorly insulated boxes that turn into ovens under the brutal summer
sun. Take away the air conditioning and the humans inside start baking, quick.
For Leary, the specter of continual, back-to-back blackouts in
July--and, some predict, in June and August too--conjures images of an
82-year-old man, living alone in one of those mobile homes, taking medication
for heart disease. The cardiovascular drugs plague the man with numerous side
effects; one inhibits his body's ability to cool itself.
When a person gets overheated, body temperature eventually rises
uncontrollably. Then comes a nasty spiral of effects, and pretty soon "you go
into shock," Leary said. "Everything just shuts down."
On average each year, 371 Americans die from heat-related causes, more
than the number killed by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning and
floods combined. In 1995, a record hot spell in Chicago killed 465 people.
Eleven Californians died from the heat in 1998.
A new report by the United Seniors Assn. predicts that more than half a
million elderly Californians could need hospitalization for heat-related
ailments this summer.
Some communities have laid plans for cooling shelters, wading pools and
other measures to provide relief. But will all who need help get it? Or get
it in time?
Out in the desert, paramedics expect a crush of 911 calls when the power
goes out and the ill, frail and frightened seek help. Leary and others at
Eisenhower Medical Center will be waiting, armed with ice packs, cooled IVs
and ventilators.
"I am very, very worried," the doctor said. "I think we'll see a great
toll in human suffering, even mortality."
California's tomato processors are no less anxious. They wash, cook,
peel, chop, mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from July to
October--enough to account for half the world's supply. For them, a string of
unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days.
The reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processing--a sterile
system instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plant's precise
temperature is disturbed.
Once a batch of tomatoes is tainted, it must be thrown out--all 50,000
pounds. The plant must then be sanitized, a painstaking process that takes
about 36 hours.
"If you get hit by blackouts every third day for, say, two weeks, you're
starting, stopping, cleaning, restarting--it's a nightmare," said Jeff Boese,
president of the California League of Food Processors. "You could lose three
batches and be out $40 million before you knew what hit you."
Meanwhile, farmers with still more truckloads of tomatoes line up
outside the plant, waiting to be paid for their crop: "If we can't process
them, the farmers have spent an entire season growing them for nothing,"
Boese said.
In Sonoma County, the object in peril is the chicken. Egg producers
equip their laying houses with fans and swamp coolers to keep the hens
comfortable. Power is also needed to run giant refrigerators filled with eggs.
"In a blackout, those hens can overheat in no time," said Rich Matteis
of the Pacific Egg and Poultry Assn. "In 20 or 30 minutes, you could have
100,000 birds die."
Many large producers have backup generators, but they are not designed
for ongoing, intensive use. Will they hold up? Small-scale egg producers
often have no backup power at all.
Hundreds of other California businesses could suffer if summer shapes up
as bad as some predict.
The Valero Refining Co. of California, northeast of San Francisco,
produces 115,000 barrels of gasoline a day. Because restarting a refinery is
a complicated task, two or three blackouts close together could prompt
officials to shutter it until electricity supplies stabilize--costing
California about 10% of its gasoline supply.
At a Berkeley medical laboratory, doctors say power losses to their
freezers could destroy bone marrow needed to give young leukemia patients
lifesaving transplants. The state's 400 dialysis centers, where patients
without kidney function go to have their blood cleansed every other day, are
in the same fix. Few have backup generators, so when an outage hits,
technicians must crank the machines by hand.
Most Californians, of course, face far more ordinary consequences. The
scoreboards will fizzle at summer softball games, joggers on treadmills will
be stopped in their tracks, electric organs will go silent, leaving choirs to
sing without accompaniment.
Parents will be asked to retrieve children from day-care centers when
the lights and cooling systems conk out. Anniversary lunches may be ruined
when restaurants cannot grill salmon or blend margaritas.
Most people will tolerate occasional disturbances, psychologists say,
doing their part in a time of crisis. But what if such irritations become an
everyday fact of life?
Hundreds of "essential" energy users--including prisons, fire
departments and airports--are protected from blackouts, and hundreds more
have applied for exemptions. That means the pool of people bearing the
blackout burden is shrinking, so more frequent outages are likely.
Blackout predictions vary widely, but at least one forecaster, a
consultant for California water districts, anticipates an outage almost every
afternoon of every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm.
Californians are accustomed to trash compactors, giant-screen TVs and
having the Internet at their fingertips. How much deprivation will they
tolerate?
"So far, the version of blackouts we've experienced hasn't looked too
scary to people--it happens on a workday, in the afternoon, and you basically
have to come home and reset your VCR," said Dan Kammen, a professor of energy
and society at UC Berkeley.
But if outages become daily events, and start to invade the evening
hours, the public mood could change abruptly.
"When there's a disaster or crisis or trauma, people tend to act
heroically and work together," said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles
psychologist and trauma specialist. "But the civilized behavior only lasts a
short period. Then people start acting in unpredictable ways."
That tendency may be exacerbated, Butterworth said, by the nature of the
energy crisis--not a natural disaster, but a man-made one.
"People start to look for a scapegoat," he said. "People will look for a
target, and there's a tendency to strike out at whoever is closest to you."
One place that tendency may surface, Butterworth said, is on
traffic-clogged roads. Blackouts already have led to scores of accidents. Add
summer heat to the mix, and repeat the pattern day after day at rush hour,
and motorists' patience could wear thin, law enforcement officials say.
"We're bracing for . . . possible acts of violence and road rage," said
Sacramento County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Saunders.
Lon House is the water consultant who predicts California could see
blackouts almost every summer weekday. Among the worries for the 440 water
agencies he represents: losing the ability to pump water during wildfire
season.
"I'm telling them to be ready for a major earthquake every day this
summer--meaning all your power is out throughout your district for multiple
hours," House said.
House insists he isn't an alarmist. But on top of the fire fears, he
warns that blackouts of more than a few hours would allow air into water
pipes, contaminating supplies. If that happens, Californians would be urged
to boil their water until the system can be disinfected from one end of the
pipe to the other.
Though rolling blackouts are risky, they remain essentially a controlled
phenomenon, occurring when and where the grid managers and utilities decide.
Far more frightening--and devastating--are unexpected, cascading outages that
could shut down the entire Western power grid. It happened in August 1996,
leaving 4 million people without power during a triple-digit heat wave.
The problem began when power lines in Oregon sagged into trees and shut
themselves off. That triggered a chain reaction of automatic switch-offs and
oscillating surges of energy that ultimately shut down all four of the main
power arteries between California and the Pacific Northwest.
That robbed the system of thousands of megawatts--enough to power the
city of Seattle four times over--and scattered outages across California and
six other Western states. Thousands of customers were without power for more
than a day.
Though such an episode is rare, California grid managers say it is more
likely today because the system is taxed by the ever-increasing load of
electricity it bears.
"The system is very dynamic, and when it's heavily loaded and highly
stressed, like it is now, the smallest little thing could cause big trouble,"
said Kevin Bakker, who oversees California's connection to the greater
Western power grid.
If a massive, uncontrolled outage should hit, the ramifications could be
dizzying, said Mike Guerin, chief of law enforcement for the state Office of
Emergency Services. Police departments would probably go to tactical alert,
guarding against looting by criminals who might take advantage of disabled
alarm systems and darkened street lights.
In hot areas, cities might convert municipal buses--parked with air
conditioners running--into cooling shelters, Guerin said. The state would
provide emergency generators to nursing homes and others in need, while the
California National Guard might be called into action.
"With this kind of blackout scenario, you're not worried about the
bologna going bad in the refrigerator," Guerin said. "We're talking about
doctors doing surgeries on backup generators for three days. We're talking
about a lot of things we don't like to think about."

FERC Move Short-Circuits Push for Hard Price Caps


By RICHARD T. COOPER and JANET HOOK, Times Staff Writers

WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision to
impose full-time price ceilings on wholesale electricity in California and
the West appears to have deflated the congressional drive for a return to
traditional utility regulation.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), calling the "price mitigation" system
FERC unveiled Monday "a giant step forward," announced Tuesday that she is
pulling back her bill to force a return to the "cost of service" pricing
system that prevailed before deregulation. Republican Sen. Gordon Smith of
Oregon, a co-sponsor, agreed, as did Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of
the Senate Energy Committee.
House Democrats vowed to fight on for tougher controls, but they were
given little chance to succeed.
As a result, although the political blame game will rage on, the reality
of a long, ugly summer for California appears to have arrived: at least
several months of tears, toil, sweat--and fast-rising electric bills.
California consumers are likely to face an unpleasant paradox, energy
analysts said: Given present power shortages, blackouts are virtually
inevitable this summer. And, since state authorities are beginning to let
high wholesale prices flow through into retail bills after months of
subsidies, many consumers could face higher charges at the same time their
lights begin to flicker.
Even if FERC's order succeeds and wholesale prices fall, as they have
begun to do in recent weeks, consumers' bills are likely to rise. Since
retail charges lag well behind wholesale prices, closing the gap will
probably mean a period of higher costs for consumers, regardless of what
happens in wholesale markets.
There is light at the end of the tunnel, energy analysts said, but it is
probably a year away. And reaching it, they said, depends in part on
government officials taking no action that might spook investors and disrupt
present plans for expanding the region's capacity to generate and deliver
more power.
The new FERC system, which its designers said would provide temporary
price relief while preserving incentives for energy investment, imposes
cost-based curbs on wholesale prices throughout the West and covers all such
sales, not just those during periods of extreme shortages, as did the order
issued in April.
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. told the committee the new system
will prevent "megawatt laundering" and other potential abuses. He said his
agency is "committed to ferreting out any forms of market misbehavior 24
hours a day, seven days a week."
With the apparent collapse of demands for more intervention, Congress
now seems ready to give FERC a year or more of leeway to see whether its plan
will curb wholesale prices and create what FERC member Linda Breathitt, a
Democrat, called "a breathing spell" in which California and the West can
"repair their dysfunctional markets."
"It still remains to be seen whether there can be manipulation, but I
think we should wait and see," Feinstein said Tuesday at a Senate Energy
Committee meeting attended by all five FERC members. The commissioners call
their new system "price mitigation," not price caps, but Feinstein said it
amounts to the same thing.
"Whether you call it price mitigation or something else, a rose is a
rose is a rose," said Feinstein, a member of the energy committee.
And Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), appearing before the committee as a
witness, said: "I was very pleased with [Monday's] about-face by FERC. I
believe they have a new tone."
Democrats on the other side of the Capitol pledged to keep fighting for
traditional regulation, but with Republicans in control of the House, the
struggle appears to be largely symbolic.
House Democrats wanted to introduce amendments on price controls and
other energy policy to a mid-year supplemental appropriation bill due to come
before the House today. However, GOP leaders expected to block Democrats from
even offering the amendments on procedural grounds.
The most sweeping of the amendments would set cost-based limits on
wholesale energy prices in the West. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and
other sponsors insisted that the measure is still needed in spite of the FERC
action, which he said would continue to provide windfall profits to
generators, encourage suppliers to withhold power and do too little to
restrain the price of natural gas.
He called the FERC policy an "experiment" that is using California and
other Western states as subjects.
Similarly, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said: "Although the FERC
decision [Monday] is a step in the right direction, I am concerned it does
not remove incentives for energy suppliers to withhold power, drive up prices
and gouge consumers."
The commission went as far as it did in part because of the specter of
broader price control legislation, Pelosi said. "They felt the heat, they saw
the amendments coming and decided to act."
And Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), in an interview Tuesday, said he will
press ahead with legislation to impose hard price caps. "I would advise the
senators that after a year of dealing with these price gougers that they will
easily manipulate this latest order," he said, calling it a "Swiss cheese
order--full of holes."
Feinstein's shift put House Democrats in an awkward political position
because it came just as they prepared to make their big push for tougher
controls. But the Democrats tried to minimize the differences in legislative
strategy.
"She too is waiting to see if the FERC experiment works," Waxman said.
"I'm a little more skeptical, but we're both watching carefully."
As a political matter, a Democratic leadership aide acknowledged, the
FERC order muddies the debate at a time when Democrats have been working hard
to make it a defining issue--and one they had hoped would help them win
control of the House in the 2002 elections.
"It's hard to describe to people what the difference is between what we
want and what FERC has done," said the aide.
And Republicans said FERC's action had clearly taken the wind out of the
sails of price control efforts that some GOP strategists feared might have
passed the House.
"I would have thought [it would pass] last week," said John Feehery,
spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). "But now, with what
FERC did, it takes a lot of air out of the balloon."
"I think the FERC action will dissipate that strong push," agreed Emily
Miller, a spokeswoman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas). "It will
take the heat off."
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said the message to Democrats
was, "It's time to come off your political high horse."
He said he wanted to keep Democrats from offering their price control
amendment to Wednesday's supplemental appropriation bill because the proposal
is "a political statement, not a policy statement."

Plan Won't Raise Rates, Davis Says
Edison: Governor seeks to assure Senate, where Democrats say action is a
bailout of nearly bankrupt utility.

By CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis sought to assure the state Senate on Tuesday
that his plan to save Southern California Edison from threatened financial
collapse would work without increasing customer rates.
Davis sent assurances to the Senate Energy Committee through his top
attorney, Barry Goode, who helped negotiate the controversial proposal with
the utility.
Senate Republicans have taken a wait-and-see attitude on the plan. But
they generally contend that the business of utilities belongs in the hands of
private enterprise.
But Democrats in both houses have charged that the deal between Democrat
Davis and Edison represents a state bailout of the nearly bankrupt
Rosemead-based utility. The analysis is shared by leading consumer activists.
At the first in a series of Senate hearings on the package, which is
considered all but dead in its current form, Sen. Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto)
voiced concerns about political problems with the plan.
He asked Goode, who was flanked at a witness table by Edison executives,
whether monthly bills of the utility's customers would increase as a
consequence of approval of the governor's package.
"Our models say there will be no additional impact on the ratepayers,"
Goode replied.
Other members appeared ready to pursue rate increase questions, but
Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) cut them short. She said the issue
would be fully examined at a later hearing.
To spare Edison from going into bankruptcy and to restore its
credit-worthiness, Davis and executives of the utility reached a complex
compromise in April, the centerpiece of which was a state purchase of
Edison's transmission grid for about $2.8 billion, more than twice its book
value.
Edison has estimated that it owes $3.5 billion to creditors, including
wholesale power generators, as a result of deregulation of retail electricity
prices in 1996.
Because of a freeze in retail rates, Edison was prohibited from passing
its energy costs to customers.
Other features of the deal include dedicating a portion of consumer
rates to help pay off the debt, a guaranteed 11.6% rate of return to Edison
on its sales and investments, and termination of an ongoing Public Utilities
Commission investigation into financial dealings of Edison's parent company,
Edison International.
The energy committee held the hearing for fact-finding purposes and did
not consider the Edison bill, SB 78x by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles).
But the Davis-Edison deal has angered consumer activists, who contended
that bankruptcy for Edison would be preferable.
They deplored it as a bailout that would cost Edison customers $5
billion to $7 billion.
"If the Legislature makes the mistake of forcing the ratepayers of
California to pay one more penny to bail out these companies, we will put [an
initiative] right on the ballot," said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
Consumer organizations in 1998 put to the voters an initiative to junk
the 1996 deregulation law. The measure failed.
Rosenfield, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union and Matt Freedman of the
Utility Reform Network all asserted at a news conference that the Davis
rescue program should be killed.
Snyder, who opposed deregulation, said the governor's bill is shaping up
as a replay of 1996.
"It's too big, too complicated. . . . This is the same process that
brought about this [deregulation] disaster," Snyder said.
Separately, San Diego Gas & Electric agreed Monday to sell its
transmission grid to the state for about $1 billion on the same terms as
Edison.
With all the controversy surrounding the Edison deal, the chance of
SDG&E winning legislative approval of its sale is slightly better than 50%,
said Stephen L. Baum, chief executive of Sempra Energy, parent of SDG&E.
"I think there's a widely shared view in the Legislature that they don't
want the state in the long-term business of power procurement. . . . In order
to get Edison back into that business there has to be this infusion of
capital" to pay off past electricity debts and make the utility
credit-worthy, Baum said.

State to Pay Electric Bill With Loan, Not Taxes


By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--California taxpayers, who have had to bankroll billions of
dollars in electricity purchases for the teetering power utilities, will soon
no longer see their money evaporate at record rates, under an executive order
by Gov. Gray Davis.
As early as next week, the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the state
budget by allowing Treasurer Phil Angelides to borrow $5 billion to buy
electricity. That money is expected to cover power purchases until this fall,
when the state plans to sell an unprecedented $12.5 billion in bonds to repay
the general tax fund and buy future electricity.
Angelides said Tuesday that he has already lined up $3.5 billion in
loans from two Wall Street firms, and expects to secure at least another
billion by next week, when he plans to close the deal and obtain the money.
The loan is critical, he said, because without it, electricity purchases
would completely deplete state coffers as early as October.
"In essence, it stops the general-fund bleeding," Angelides said. "What
this interim financing does is take the pressure off the general fund and,
hopefully, avert a cash crisis."
The loan could also ease concerns on Wall Street that California's risky
entry into the power business has placed the state budget in a precarious
position. Those concerns were one of the main reasons two major credit rating
agencies downgraded the state earlier this year.
"We have been looking forward to this day," said Ray Murphy, a vice
president at Moody's Investors Service, one of the two firms that downgraded
California's credit rating. "We view this as a positive first step toward
getting the state out of the power business. We wanted the state to get the
general fund out of the business as quickly as possible."
California has allocated $8.2 billion in taxpayer money for electricity
since January because the state's private utilities became too saddled with
debt to continue purchasing power on the open market. and massive blackouts
loomed.
Under a plan devised by Davis and approved by the Legislature, the state
budget is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with the bond
issue, the largest in American history. The bonds, in turn, are to be paid
off by utility ratepayers through their monthly bills.
The bond issue, however, has been delayed by partisan politics and
complex legal issues raised by the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,
the state's largest private utility.
A bond sale initially planned for May is now scheduled for late
September, according to Angelides' latest estimate. The state's Public
Utilities Commission still needs to take a number of technical actions before
the sale can take place.
As a result, the state budget has been drained for power purchases far
longer than initially anticipated--a situation that has imperiled spending on
education, transportation and other critical needs, at least temporarily.
Angelide
