ENSE, MDEA and East Power was $5425 for last month.  I'm trying to reduce the number of users and services that we don't require.  In the end the cost should be significantly less than this number.
The west has their own arrangements with OATI.
You will not require anything for the change over to etag 1.7 in march as OATI will take care of this as part of their services.
Kevin Burns from OATI will be in Houston on Feb 13th from 1-3 to discuss UBS services required and I would recommend that you have some one sit down and review the services that you will need going foreward.
Hope this helps.
For passwords you can contact Don for MDEA & EPMIEA and Eric has the Genco ones.
Thanks.
