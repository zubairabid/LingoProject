Friends,

Attached is the "Final" draft of the Harvard Business School case study
prepared by Harvard Professor Chris Bartlett and his research assistant Meg
Wozny. [please scroll down to the end of the next message for the attachment]
.  The content was developed from interviews with most of you.

Please review the case and let me know of any desired
edits/corrections/comments as soon as possible. [One obvious correction is
the spelling of Cindy Olson's last name].

We'd like to "sign off" on this within the next 2 or 3 days. Harvard
professors are excited about teaching this case this coming semester.  In
fact, Professor Don Sull will be focusing largely on this Enron Case this
semester, culminating in "Enron Day" at Harvard Business School April 26th,
featuring Jeff Skilling. Also, Chris and Meg will be in Houston this
Thursday, Jan. 11th, 'capping off' their work with video interviews with Ken,
Jeff and Louise, which will help "bring the case to life" for the students
studying it.

Please forward any edits/corrections/comments to me via E-Mail or via hard
copy (please deliver to EB 4710, or call me [3-6117] and we'll have it picked
up).

Thanks  to everyone for all your contributions to this exciting work!

--Christie.
