All,
Today, I learned that Kinder Morgan has approached FERC with a proposal to submit separate applications on phase one (NM, AZ) and phase two (CA) of the Sonoran Pipeline.  Reportedly, FERC rejected the approach, advising KM to come back when they could make an application on the full project.  This probably delays their filing timetable because the California leg will be significantly more difficult to market, environmental stakeholders are likely to be more adversarial, and the probability of activist NIMBY landowners is high.
Does anybody know when KM plans to file their application?  Is Phase one in-service of summer 2003 feasible if an application for the full pipeline is required?  How long would it take KM to prepare the phase two application for the Sonoran project?
Please keep this info confidential.  Also, it would be helpful if you could corroborate through your sources.
