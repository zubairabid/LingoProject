El Paso, Coastal Consolidate Pipeline Staff

El Paso Energy and Coastal Corp. announced plans yesterday to relocate more
than 1,200 employees and retain only satellite offices at the El Paso Natural
Gas headquarters in El Paso, TX, and the ANR Pipeline headquarters in
Detroit, MI, once their merger is approved by the FTC, which is expected
sometime in the fourth quarter. No final decision on staff reductions has
been made, an El Paso spokeswoman said.

The companies intend consolidate the operations of their five pipeline
systems into three organizations, collectively led by John W. Somerhalder II.
Under the consolidation plan, the combined company's nationwide pipeline
system will be consolidated into three regional operations. The western
region will consist of El Paso Natural Gas Company and Colorado Interstate
Gas Company and will be headquartered in Colorado Springs, CO. The eastern
region will consist of ANR Pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline and will be
headquartered in Houston. Southern Natural will make up the southeastern
region headquartered in Birmingham, AL.

John Somerhalder will continue as the executive vice president of the El Paso
Pipeline Group. Patricia A. Shelton, currently president of El Paso Natural
Gas, will lead the consolidated western region pipelines. Jay Holm, currently
responsible for El Paso's Australian pipeline assets, will return to the
United States to become CEO of the eastern region. Reporting to Holm as
presidents of Tennessee and ANR will be Stephen C. Beasley and James J.
Cleary, respectively. The southeastern region will be led by James C.
Yardley, who will continue as president of Southern. Shelton, Holm, and James
Yardley will report to Somerhalder.

"This consolidation will create the most effective organization for El Paso's
pipeline system," said El Paso CEO William A. Wise. "Our upcoming merger with
Coastal will create an interstate transmission system that spans the nation,
border to border and coast to coast. This consolidation represents a highly
disciplined approach to managing this system, allowing us to strike a proper
balance between customer focus and operational efficiency. It also
facilitates a company-to-company exchange of expertise across our system and
speeds the merging of separate company cultures."

While the companies will be organizationally merged, the five pipeline
systems will remain separate with separate tariffs and separate names. Though
many back office functions such as accounting and gas control will be
consolidated and relocated to the new headquarters, field functions and
related activities will remain in their current locations. In addition, some
employees will remain in the El Paso and Detroit locations. The company will
ask affected employees whether they want to be considered for relocation.
Those employees who elect not to relocate will be given severance packages.
Most moves will occur during the first half of next year, and the majority of
the plan is expected to be implemented by mid-2001.

The companies announced their $16 billion polling-of-interests transaction in
January (see Daily GPI, Jan. 19). The merger is expected to be accretive to
El Paso's earnings per share (EPS) immediately and add more than 5% to EPS in
both 2001 and 2002, Wise said at the time of the merger announcement.
Overall, the two companies expect $200 million in cost savings. By
comparison, the El Paso-Sonat merger created more than $100 million in
savings and more than 600 people lost their jobs.

The combined interstate transmission system of the new company will consist
of over 58,000 miles of pipeline, by far the most of any pipeline company in
North America. The system will transport more than 20 Bcf/d of gas through
existing pipeline infrastructure, but will have sole or part ownership in
three other new or proposed major pipelines, including Alliance, Gulfstream
and Independence. The company also will be the second largest gatherer of
natural gas in the United States and the third largest U.S. producer of gas.
