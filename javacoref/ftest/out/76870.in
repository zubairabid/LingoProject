Our Tennessee report of storage balances, which is printed from Tennessee's system, no longer shows the Citizens storage information.  This is consistent with the Tennessee rep telling us that Citizens revoked their agency (to Enron).  Have you seen a notice of termination yet?

If not, should I call the Citizens contact to inquire?  Should I have an attorney participate in that discussion?

Thanks
