DRAFT -FOR DISCUSSION ONLY.

Lynn,
(Please consider for inclusion but only if Mr. Gruber, Mr. Bacile, Mr. Hayslett, and Mr. Harris
concur)

Possible topics:

1. What is FERC's accounting position on the Exposure Draft related to Accounting for Certain Activities Related to Property, Plant, and Equipment, and is the FERC going to author a formal comment?

2. With increased emphasis and regulation related to pipeline safety and integrity, it appears that a number of companies in the industry are embarking on significant programs to throughly test their systems. A significant aspect of a program of this nature is smart pigging and hydrostatic testing. What is the FERC's accounting position on possible capitalization of these costs?

3. Of recent, the FASB has issued new rules, ie., SFAS 142 on Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and SFAS 143  - Asset Retirement Obligations. Is the FERC going to issue regulatory accounting guidance on these new rules?

4. "GAAP"-"RAP" differences has for some time been a informal topic of discussion. With increased FASB rulemaking activity this risk may be increasing. Since "RAP" is mandated by Federal Law has the FERC have any concerns that pipeline application of "GAAP" that may be deemed, at variance to "RAP" may also be violation of federal law? (ie., #1 above, and levelized rate making accounting, approved in rate settlements, but not "approved" for GAAP)
