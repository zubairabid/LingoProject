I understand that the lease assignment needs to happen.  However, it is my understanding from talking directly to the landlord that they are modifying the lease to require us to pay for certain separatioon costs and upgrades to their facilities (e.g., security access to all of their floors in this building).  The landlord has also agreed, in concept, to provide us a six month option at the beginning of the term.

Based on discussions with you yesterday, it seemed that UBSW was not willing to insert any of the language that I wanted into the lease (e.g., six month option to get out), but was willing to insert language that the landlord wanted (obligating UBSW to several $100k of costs).  Why would UBSW do this?

I recommend that we either (1) make the landlord's changes and my changes this week or (2) make no changes this week and work to get the lease that both sides want next week.
