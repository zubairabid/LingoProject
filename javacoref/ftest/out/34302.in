Center for Houston's Future Board Members,
2000 Business-Civic Leadership Founding Forum Participants,
2001 Business-Civic Leadership Forum Participants:

Please consider this event -- a compelling speech by Dynegy's Chairman
and CEO, Chuck Watson.  This event is another in a series of speeches by
prominent business people in our region focused upon Houston, the region
and its possibilities.

The incoming Winter 2002 Business-Civic Leadership Forum Participants
have been encouraged to attend.  If possible, please attend both the
reception (11:30 a.m.) and luncheon event (noon) to meet and show
support to the incoming Forum participants.  Luncheon seating will be
arranged together. This will be an excellent networking opportunity.

This event will set the stage for The Center's forum dialogue, provide a
first opportunity for the Winter Forum participants to meet their peers
in a social setting and offer a time for current Center volunteers to
interact with those who will step forward at the close of this next
Forum, March 2.

Cost:  $21.50  Please e-mail a reply to this invitation to Marilou
