Just a reminder:

Beginning tomorrow, the (formerly twice-weekly) California call will now take place once per week, on Wednesdays, at the same time (11:30 AM PDT/1:30 CDT), same call-in number.
Until the next legislative session starts up in January, the call will be optional for the gang in Sacramento, unless something specific requires their participation.

Best,
Jeff
