EOL users can run eports and see all the details of transactions.  As
currently structured this would mean that any EOL user, including ENA, would
be able to run a report to see detail behind bids on pipeline capacity.
Obviously this would be a problem under the marketing affiliate rules.  At
their last meeting Dale and Shelley outlined three possible ways to address
this:

Add security such that ENA/EES users cannot run reports on pipeline bid
data.  I understood leaving the meeting that this might be technically
difficult or expensive.
Exclude pipeline data from the reporting feature altogether.  Here the story
was that while this was not necessarily difficult, EOL could not make any
changes before version 2 was ready.  The impression was that this would be
possible after version 2.
Erect procedural firewalls.  Mark Taylor suggested that perhaps we could
inform all ENA and EES personnel that the company has a policy that prevents
them from running reports on GPG data.  This probably isn't a good long-run
solution, but we all agreed that it might serve as a bridge measure.  This
approach is supported by the fact that Enron Networks has already entered
into a confidentiality agreement with GPG.

Solutions 1 and 2 require extensive technical work and unfortunately we
cannot currently spare the technical resources required for it. We can go
with solution 3 at present with the understanding that in the absence of a
large volume of trades it might be the permanent solution. This is something
that legal on both sides would have to agree to. Steve will check with their
legal department to see if this is acceptable. Dale can you please check with
Mark Taylor.

Further the credit departments on both sides should meet and iron out the
credit issues. Steve is going to make sure the two credit departments talk to
each other.

Thanks.
