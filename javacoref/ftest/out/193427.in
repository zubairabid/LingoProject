Manfred / Sven - congratulations on getting the Bremen deal signed!  This
business represents the first significat long-term deal we have in Germany.
It also allows us to expand our "stockpile" business on the Continent - and
will allow us to develop a hub in Nordenham.  The ability to put petcoke to
Bremen is an added benefit.

Nice job on this deal - it took a lot of work on your part to get Bremen
comfortable with our shipping such a large percent of their requirements.

Best regards,

George
