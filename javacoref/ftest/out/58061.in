Mark/Greg,

Our target was to have all evaluations completed by August 31 (we had hoped that all below VP's would be done by August 17). At year end we achieved close to 90% completion of written evaluations. The HR team are working hard to help their clients get these finalised, but I would appreciate all of your help in chasing this process to a successful conclusion.
