Carol,
Per our conversation earlier regarding American Central Energy, LLC, I spoke
to Dan Fry at the counterparty and feel the following steps can be taken with
the current ISDA.  I feel it is not necessary to terminate the contract at
this point, as they are in negotiations to receive another parent guaranty
from a new majority owner.  I do feel it necessary though if a letter can be
drafted stating that the cancellation of their guaranty is an Event of
Default thus reducing their threshold to zero enabling Enron to margin any
exposure that exists.  Also, as we discussed, the letter should explain that
the guaranty is still in effect up until 5 days after notice of cancellation.
Please let me know any comments you may have.
Thank you,
