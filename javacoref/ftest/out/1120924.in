Also, I seem to remember in some employee forum -- maybe an eSpeak or the all-employee meeting -- where an employee raised the question of Arthur Anderson's practices and maybe something about their handling of financial structures in other companies.  I'm not sure if it was a shareholder resolution or just a comment, but I believe at the Annual Meeting we were questioned about our process for reviewing the appropriateness of AA as our auditor (this probably isn't unusual at shareholder meetings).  In any case, my point was that as long as we are putting together Q's and A's we might want to include something about AA's role in all of this, in case it comes up.
