Mike, in going over Contract Exhibit A to revise the Ash Content in Section 4, Fuel Oil Specification,  I ran across a note in my work file from an April 18 e-mail response from MHI where they transmitted two comments back to us  on their review of Exhibit A.

The first comment is on the viscosity value that Enron listed in Section 4.  Our value listed is 6.8 Cst (max.).  MHI comment is "Please supply fuel oil with maximum viscosity 5.8 Cst at any temperature".

The second MHI comment just re-emphasizes our listed value for Barium, Manganese and Phosphorus which is shown as 2 ppm (wt) (Max.).  MHI comment is "Please limit Ba, Mg, Phosphorous within max. 2 ppm."

Please let me know if we can accomodated the MHI comment on the viscosity and revise the value from our original 6.8 Cst down to the 5.8 Cst value that MHI is requesting.  Doug Ottens does not think that using the MHI value will be a problem.

The second MHI comment has no impact on the Exhibit as the 2 ppm (Max.) is what we have listed for the value.

Let me know so that I can revise this Exhibit A and send it on to Mark Thurber for inclusion in the revised MHI P.O. Contract.

Thanks,
Frank
