(May 3, 2001)

Take notice that the staff of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will

offices, 888 First Street, NE, Washington, D.C. 20426.  All interested

As Commission staff has dealt with various aspects of the current energy
situation in California, questions have arisen regarding current and

the adequacy of the natural gas infrastructure within California.  Commission
staff is interested in the views of natural gas transporters, producers,
consumers, regulators, and other interested parties with respect to issues
including:

1) current and projected interstate pipeline capacity to California;

2) current and projected capacity of California intrastate pipelines and
other      natural gas infrastructure;

3) physical and operational interconnection between the interstate and
intrastate                 transportation systems;

4) current and projected California demand for natural gas; and

5) how intrastate capacity in California is allocated.

The conference will not include the discussion of any ongoing proceedings
before the  Commission.

The conference will be organized in two stages.  The first stage will
consist of presentations of factual information on the topics listed above.
The second stage will consist of discussion on the topics.

beginning of the conference.  Depending on the number of presentations, it
may be necessary for staff to contact presenters prior to the conference to
coordinate the presentations.
