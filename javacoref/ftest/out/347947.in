Earlier this week the NY PSC finally issued its Order approving competitive
billing options and requiring the utilities to develop "back-out" credits for
this service based on long-run avoided costs.  The Order is an extremely
pro-competition statement and contains language that should prove useful in
other State proceedings where competitive billing (and metering) is being
debated.  A copy of the Order is attached.  In brief, it allows single
billing by the ESCO or by the Utility (at the customer/ESCO's request) and
directs the utilities to file their tariffs with back-out credits by April
24, 2000.  There will be a brief collaborative review of the filings in May
and June.  The new tariffs are to go into effect October 2, 2000.
