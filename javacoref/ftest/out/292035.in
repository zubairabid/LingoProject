I would like for us to take a look at charging Peerless some sort of number based on the market price for leased storage.  I talked to a guy in the Enron liquids group who said that 2-oil tankage in the Caribbean goes for about $0.25- $0.30 per barrel per month.  If we leased them only 150,000 bbls of capacity in the tank and kept the rest for ourselves, that would be around $40,000/month.  The actual number could be whatever we are comfortable with keeping in storage as minimums.  If we could get something out of it every month and still sell them our inventory that would be great.  But I would also like to know how it looks in case they wouldn't go for that and we had to hold title to whatever oil we already have in the tank. Then we could still have some sort of pricing mechanism for buying and selling oil to each other in the tank.
From what I heard from Peerless, they would plan to unload vessels into Eco's tank, then transfer out of that tank to their other tanks when needed.  Whatever the case would be, we would have to have controls on quality in our tank, and insist on seeing the analysis on everything before it goes into the tank.
