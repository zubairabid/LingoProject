Steve,

Since our phone call, I spoke to Mark Taylor, who advised me that the local
counsel is planning to come back to us next week with a detailed opinion
regarding the taxation issues for trading in Brazil and Argentina.

Under these circumstances, it seems wise to postpone our planned conference
call until after outside counsel has responded.

However, I remain concerned about this issue. As discussed, if we are unable
to formulate a plan which we believe has a good chance of succeeding, and if
the tax regime is so penal as to make trading on EnronOnline prohibitively
expensive, then we need to seriously reevaluate the timetable for EnronOnline
and postpone preparation efforts until such time as either the tax regime
changes or we identify a way around the tax restrictions.

I will contact you later next week after we hear from outside counsel.
Hopefully their response will put my concerns to rest.

Dave
