I've set an interview for Ken Lay with David Ivanovich of the Houston
Chronicle for Tuesday morning at 9.  David knows that we are "playing a major
role" in the WTO, wants to know what we're there for, what our message will
be.  The attached one pager is the basic point of our position on energy
services--anything else that I should ask Ken to stress?  Rob, will Ken's
speech be in good enough shape to either pull bullet points or let Ken peruse
the speech beforehand?

David heard that Exxon has not signed on to the energy services coalition and
wants to know why. I have found out from Joe Hillings the answer and will
tell David that Exxon is most welcome to join the coalition and all parties
would value their input.  Beyond that he can find out from Exxon why they are
monopolistic!  (I won't say that part).

Ken may be asked about our position on China's involvement, which we can
handle.  Anything else you can think of that we might be asked regarding the
event itself or the scores of protesters that will be there?
