Just a reminder regarding all of the high-tech recruiting activity
taking place this week.  Where noted, please sign-up in BearTracks
if you plan to attend.

By the way, the correlation between the sign-ups and
the actual attendees has been inconsistent so far this year. It really
helps the companies regarding space and food planning as well as how many
reps to send.  Please sign up if you plan to attend and remove yourself
if your plans change. The system allows you to sign up up to one day before
the
event.

Thanks,
Rich Wong
Account Manager, Technology
Haas Career Center
