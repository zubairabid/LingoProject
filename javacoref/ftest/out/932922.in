I will be out of the office on Wednesday, January 3.  I am married to an OU
graduate, so we are headed to the Orange Bowl to hopefully see Oklahoma hang
onto their number 1 ranking.  I will be back in the office after lunch on
Thursday, January 4.

My assistant, Patti Thompson (x39106), has phone numbers where I can be
reached.  Please contact Bob Hall at x36956 with any questions while I am
out.
