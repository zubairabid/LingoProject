Update:  Senator Phil Gramm placed a hold on the S. 2071 late, late last
evening in order to preserve his options to serve on the Conference with a
broader House bill version.  The Senate should go out for the July 4th recess
this evening so consideration of this bill on the Senate floor will be
deferred until their return the week of July 10th.  Senators Gramm and
Schumer also intend to introduce their electricity restructuring bill this
evening.
