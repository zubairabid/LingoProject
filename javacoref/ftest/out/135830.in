From this side, Sharon Damron's reaction doesn't fit with what I've heard
from other pipes.  For instance, Staff called one of the CMS pipes to
schedule a tech. conference on Nov. 14, but the pipe couldn't do it that day
and offered to schedule it for the 15th -- Staff answered that they would
schedule something for January in that case.  This story is more in line with
what I've heard about the timeline for Staff.

Also, in other cases Staff has given scheduling deference to meetings with
customers (settlement meetings in Dominion's case, which caused Staff to
postpone their 2nd tech. conference by 7 weeks).
