Attached for your reference is a copy of the meeting notes taken on July 13,
2000 during a meeting with PG&E at TW's Flagstaff Compressor Station.  One of
the critical issues that came out of this effort was finding out from PG&E
that they need TW's deliveries to blend into the richer gas that they are
receiving from El Paso and Kern River so they can meet their air permit
emission limits on VOC's.  If they do not have TW's deliveries (dry gas) for
the blending they will not be able to maintain compliance in some
non-attainment areas.  John Shafer
