Okay - our exchanges of e-mail were suppose to improve mutual understanding
and it seems to keep getting deeper as I go.
Two issues - 1) putting multiple transmission providers on the same path on
a tag (stacking of parallel providers), and 2) transmissionless interchange
(business practice #11)
Number 1 - don't we in the WSCC want the ability to have tags that can
contain multiple transmission providers on the same path?  For example PSEI,
PGE, and BPAT are all TPs offering Johnday-COB service.  There could be a
transaction that would utilize a reservation with each provider and it would
be most convenient to stack all that information in one tag.
Andy suggests the WSCC might want to come-up with an alternative, such as
one administrator TP for the whole path.  Sounds like an RTO.
So, if we have a choice, we prefer the ability to stack providers on a tag -
yes???
Number 2 - the transmissionless interchange.  I have been suggesting that we
will continue on with our practice just using the TP that belongs to source
(or sink) as stated in BP #11.  Andy doesn't think that'll fly in 1.7.  What
really concerns me is his statement that "Under 1.7, a CA cannot exist
without a parent TP."  Funny, I always looked at it the other way around.  I
don't know what that means to SCL, CHPD, and other CAs who, up till now,
have not registered as TPs.
My example was a MIDC CA to CA transaction that has historically been at the
bus without transmission.  The participants have traditionally used their
interchange accounting systems to record these deals as scheduled
interchange with another CA.  Transmission was not taken into consideration
since the participants had owned and/or contract rights from MIDC to their
systems.  In addition, it has been an easy way to path-it-out by sinking it,
then creating separate transaction source at the same place.
I did feel that this issue shouldn't be brought to IS's attention - that we
would just work it out with our business practices.  What do you think?
