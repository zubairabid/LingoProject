why does LM6000 contract still have brackets around the number of turbines to
be assigned to WestLB?  Why does it still ignore the change orders rose asked
you to include?
why does schedule v to PA still ignore the change orders to the various
documents?
Please correct or advise why requests for changes are NOT being made.
As you know,  these documents are deliverables on Wednesday.  Blue Dog had
comments from the other side today.  Why haven't I seen a revision or been
asked if I agree with their comments?
Please do not operate in a vacuum without consulting me or Roseon
questionable issues.
