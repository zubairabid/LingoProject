Number of hits to Enron's CAL business website dedicated to the energy crisis
As of April 2nd, our California page had been loaded 16 times from
individuals outside of Enron.  This site was created specifically for the CAL
business direct mail effort.  The 115 businesses who were sent the package
were the only entities that we promoted this site with. **if you are an enron
employee, it's okay to hit the site from within the Enron building.  We can
differentiate between hits from inside and outside of Enron.  If you work for
Enron outside of the EB in Houston.....please do not go to the site.  Our
ability to track hits will then be skewed.  Thanks.**
