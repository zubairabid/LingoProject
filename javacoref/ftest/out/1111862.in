After reading the FTC document, I am concerned that we are loosing sight of the fact that the RTO is first and foremost a provider of transmission service.  It will decide who uses the system, how it will be used, what schedules will be accepted, etc.  Do we really want it to set the standards by its performance is to be judged by others?  There are two tendencies to guard against.  (1)  Most of these organizations are going to be not-for-profit ISOs in form.  There may be a tendency to use very stringent rules to minimize outage risk and criticism of the RTO's management.  This could require the construction of facilities when they are not completly necessary.  (2) The opposite possiblity exists, namely, that they will adjust rules to cover their own mistakes.  I think the former problem is the most likely.

If the RTOs take over the NERC role as suggested, then the reliability rules would have to become part of the FERC tariff.  In order to judge the validity of the "reliability provisions" of the tariffs the FERC will be required to develop expertise it does not have.  In practice NERC doesn't have the expertise either.  It really resides in the members of the committees and is thus derived from the industry.  By having a separate Standards Setting Organization, the rules can still be established using the expertise of the industry.  The SSO would propose rules which FERC would accept subject to complaint.  The SSO's governance has to be fair, but I am not personally concerned about it being indepenent as long as FERC has oversight. It is the service provider (the RTO) that needs to be independent.  The standards in most industries are set in this way.  The power of the state to enforce the rules come from commissions of various types.  For instance, the National Electric Code is developed by the industry, but its enforcement is accomplished by adopting it into building codes, state liscensing requirements, etc.  In the same way, the SSO can develop the reliability rules which are incorporated in FERC's requirement imposed on the RTO.  The RTO's tariff would incorporate them by reference.  If the RTOs performance violates the rules or if a generator doesn't hold up its requirements, then ADR/FERC action can be taken to enforce.

My reason for this long message is to draw attention to the fact that the major function of the RTO is provision of transmission service.  It should not see itself as a regulator.  The case of the CAISO is instructive, since they think they are above compliance with rules since the believe they are the guardians of the public interest.  When the service provider thinks it regulates to comes to believe it has a right to decide who "should" have transmission service rather than get on with providing it.
