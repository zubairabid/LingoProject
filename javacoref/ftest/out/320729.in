Lisa,
I haven't gotten the executed docs back, but I'll send you the electronic
version if that works for you.
Timing is as follows:
Northwestern gives 30 days notice of readiness to close.  If the closing does
not occur before July 16, they make another $5m payment.
10 days after notice, they fund the balance into escrow, and we close 20 days
later.
If they fail to close on or before Sept 1, they forfeit their previous
payments, unless we have failed to provide the GE consent to assignment,
which we are working on now.
I've given this timeline without looking at the doc, so I will let you know
if I missed something.
Hopes this helps.
