Isn't it funny that the same people who would have been screaming the loudest
about the "immorality" of Bill and Hilary Clinton had their daughter,
Chelsea, been cited for underage drinking  are the same people who now find
the treatment of the Bush family so "outrageous?"  I can't stand Chuy''s
because their food is too heavy but I plan to eat there every week just to
offset the amazing level of hypocrisy I have seen in the several e-mails I
have received related to this subject.
