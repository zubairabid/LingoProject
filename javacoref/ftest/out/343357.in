SK - I've taken care of booking him a conf room/office on 47.  mm

As an organisational announcement is imminent, and it is no secret, that I
will be assuming responsibility for Asia (including Japan), Africa, and
Australia, I am planning to fly to Houston on Sunday, 13 Feb., and would like
to meet each of you, either because you will become a direct report, or a new
customer.  I will have my assistant, Sharon, coordinate times.  I will look
forward to the prospect of meeting each of you.  Should your schedule not
allow a meeting this time, I will be back in Houston on Monday 13 March.  If
you know of anyone else I should meet, but have inadvertently omitted from
this list, please feel free to advise Sharon, as well.   thanks  mcs

Sharon - for many of these people I can go their offices, but see if Maureen
can find a space I can land for meetings, as some will not have offices.
