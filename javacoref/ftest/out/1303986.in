Since<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;they were without their boyfriends, they decided to go in.<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The doorman, a very attractive guy, explains to them how it works...<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;"We have 5 floors...go up floor by floor, and once you<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt; find what you are looking for, you can stay there. It's easy to<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;decide, since each floor has signs telling you what's inside."<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;So they start going up, and on the first floor the sign<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;reads "All the men here are horrible lovers, but they are sensitive<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;and kind" ...<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The friends laugh and without hesitation move on to the<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;next floor.<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The sign on the Second floor reads "All the men here are<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;wonderful lovers, but they generally treat women badly. This<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;wasn't going to do.<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;So the friends move up to the Third floor where the sign<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;read "All the men here are great lovers and sensitive to the needs of<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;women."<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;This was good but there were still two more floors, so<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;they moved on to the fourth floor, where the sign read:<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;"All the men here have perfect builds; are sensitive and attentive to<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;women; are perfect lovers; they are also single, rich and straight"<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;The women were very pleased but still they decided that<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;they would rather see what the fifth floor had to offer before they<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;settled for the fourth.<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;When they reached the Fifth floor, there was only a sign that read:<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;"There are no men here. This floor was built only to prove that there<BR>&gt; &gt; &gt;is no way to please a woman."</FONT></P>
