I am pleased to announce that Vance Meyer joins the corporate public
relations team today as director of media relations.  Vance comes to Enron
from Connecticut-based The Stanley Works, where he worked for three years as
director of communications and public affairs and was responsible for
corporate media, community and government relations, employee communications
and charitable contributions for the $2.8 billion tool company.  Prior to
Stanley, Vance worked for General Electric for 12 years in several positions,
both at the company's headquarters and at various field locations.  While at
Stanley and GE, Vance developed strong media relations skills, working with
key trade and mainstream business and finance publications.  At GE, Vance
managed a Business Week cover story on Jack Welch, as well as cover stories
in CIO and Chief Executive magazines.

Vance has a bachelor's degree in journalism from Ball State University in
Indiana.  He and his wife, Theresa, and their 18-month-old son, Sam, are
relocating to Houston.

Please join me in welcoming Vance to the PR team.
