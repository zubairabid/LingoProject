Good news.
ABN Amro told us yesterday that they want to pursue this line and have it
closed by the end of the week.  They asked us to send them a copy of the
documentation where it stands up to now.  They gave us a copy of their
mark-up of the Corp Guarantee which I gave to all of you.  ABN is motivated
to get this done and will be amenable on pricing.
Bank One talked to Jeff Shankman last night and has agreed to an effective
rate of 0 for the initial margin.  They will charge us FF+30 but will
reimburse us at FF+30 for any cash margins (see Schedule 1.)  Also Bank One
will charge $2.55 a side for the commission ($5.10 total.)  Jeff told Bank
One that ENE recently decided to pay all of its brokers the same fee
(explains discrepancy between documentation and commission quotes from
trading floor.)  As for the variation margin, the charge will be FF+30.  Bank
One has  documents:
Customer Agreement - amendments will be made to Schedule 1 to reflect newly
proposed commercial terms.
Enron Corp. Guaranty - Bank One needs to discuss Joel's request for Enron
standard documentation
Credit line document - Jason/Sara need to make any necessary comments
Master Note (Promissory note) - NY law/jurisdiction will be acceptable.  Bank
One needs to discuss Joel's' request for standard Enron documentation.
Let's get together today so that we can organise ourselves to get our
comments to the docs consolidated and close these as quickly and efficiently
as possible.
