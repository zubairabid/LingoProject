Looks fine to me.  Pls let me know if there's anything I can do to help going
forward.  I think that we have a very good relationship in place with these
guys.
Eric / Jeffrey - I'm going to be in Austin on Friday, and would like to stop
by the plant around 9 am to check it out.  I'm playing phone tag with Chris
and Andy to check their availability (I know Chris has a staff meeting at
that time).  Pls let me know if you guys are going to be around then (don't
make a special trip).
