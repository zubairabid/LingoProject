Met with the Team on Friday (713-01) to review the location and possible options for the Duke I/C at WT-1. The concern with the 4" restriction and the 30 mm they want to flow on Sept. 1, and if we would be able to take it.

Calculated the pressure drop through the 4" valve with a worse case option of a 3" hole that was hot tapped (4" piping and valves is apx. 18" in length and rest of I/C is 8")  and the pressure drop at 30mm is 6 to 7 lbs. Duke has compression on this line and their pressure drop on the 8" lateral is in the 40 lbs. range to the inlet of WT-1. With the proposed tie-in to the discharge side of the station later, and no more pressure drop that has been calculated on the suction side, we should be able to handle the additional volumes with the current set up.

There are several options that can take place and we can evaluate once Duke has installed their scrubber.
1) The existing piping from Duke's I/C is manifolded  with a 4" to the inlet side of the scrubbers (current gas flow) and a 4" to the outlet side of the scrubbers (currently closed). Once Duke installs their scrubber and it work satisfactory, the Team can open the 4" on the outlet side of their scrubbers and have 2 (two) points for gas to flow on the  suction side of WT-1.
2) If the proposed tie in to the discharge side develops, we can revisit another tie-in point for the suction side at that time and if Dukes scrubber performs satisfactory. With Dukes scrubber in place and in operation, it allows for open access to locations for a tie in, as most of the piping on the pre-scrubbers side at WT-1 is very congested.

I would recommend that we leave I/C as is for now, if there are concerns or questions, please let me know.
