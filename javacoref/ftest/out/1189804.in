I am pleased to announce a new large scale steel piece completed for the
show "Once Removed" at Socrates Sculpture Park in Long Island City, New
York.  Almost 8 tons of steel, over 500 pieces of Cor-ten steel
attached by nearly 4500 stainless steel bolts and measuring 23 feet in
length and 28 feet in width, this flexible structure slumps and slides
across the landscape.  A continuation of an exploration of structures
that have a role in their own making, it is a simple system whose final
form is only semi-determined.

The exhibition opens June 4th from 2 - 5pm and remains onview through
the summer.  See the attached website for directions and hours

Socrates Sculpture Park is a 4.5 acre, waterfront sculpture park located on
the East River in Long Island City, Queens. Socrates Sculpture Park is one of
the few places In New York City where large-scale, outdoor sculpture can be
enjoyed by the public. Since its opening In the fall of 1986 the Park has
presented a constantly changing selection of work by the most exciting
artists working today. Sculptors from all regions of the United States,
Europe and Central America have been joined by musicians, dancers, painters
and filmmakers to create a multi-media modern art showcase.

Socrates Sculpture Park is situated In Long Island City, Queens, where
private homes, factories and warehouses co-exist in an unpretentious
neighborhood with breathtaking views of the Manhattan skyline. Appropriately,
the park is located on the border of the largest population of Greeks outside
Athens.

History and Goals of Socrates Sculpture Park

Socrates Sculpture Park Is a former illegal dumpsite leased from New York
City's Department of Ports and Trade for $1 per year. The site required
almost a year of work to clear and landscape before the first installation of
sculpture was possible. Socrates Sculpture Park is the masterwork of the
Athena Foundation, which was created In 1977 by the sculptor Mark di Suvero
to encourage the arts, to expand the culture and to create a space for the
harmonious interaction of people and art.

After a year of clearing what was once an illegal garbage dump, the Park
opened its first exhibition of contemporary, outdoor sculpture in 1986. Since
that time, Socrates continues to revitalize the economic, social,
educational, and cultural life of this community via activities that
encourage creative interaction between artists, their art, and the community
through visual arts and outreach programs. The Park's existence is based on
the belief that reclamation, revitalization and creative expression are
essential to the survival, humanity and improvement of our urban environment.

At a ceremony on May 23,1993, Socrates officially became part of the NYC
Dept. of Parks & Recreation. As the newest addition to Park land in over a
decade SSP is the only NYC park dedicated solely to the creation & exhibition
of contemporary sculpture. In 1995, Socrates was designated as one of sixty
three "Great American Public Places," testimony to the fact that the Park is
an exemplary model of the built environment. Although our new relationship
with the City of NY guarantees our existence for years to come it does not
provide support for our outreach programs for youth or community residents.

Community Collaborations Initiative

Since Its inception the Park has operated outreach programs for youth and
neighborhood residents. In 1990 SSP founded the Education Department,
offering a variety of innovative & alternative programs to some of NYC
neediest youth from the local community, as well as off-site in NYC public
schools. Many of our program target youth from high risk backgrounds. These
workshops further the Park's goal to redefine the role of the art institution
as a purveyor of alternative education in the schools, community and
eventually society.

Through our Community Collaborations Initiative, Socrates is able to design
on a one-on-one basis special hands on art workshops. While many schools have
lost funds for fine arts programs, Arts Education is now recognized as an
essential part of healthy development and a rounded education.
