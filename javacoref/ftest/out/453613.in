As a follow-up to our discussions yesterday, attached is a revised
statement/Q&As.  This statement reflects significant changes
from the Enron India team.  It has been approved by Wade Cline and Sandeep
Katwala (legal).   The  issue will probably resurface tomorrow,
so your early comments and approval would be appreciated.  I can be reached
at home (713-572-9556) or cellular (281-948-7273) this evening.

There have been a number of press reports today about the payment issue.
Copies of the stories follow.  The Reuters' story was previously forwarded by
Jim Hughes.
In addition, there have been a number of India press reports including the
Times of India story, which may be picked up by some international wire
services. The other
two Indian press reports appear to have taken other discussions/background
briefings and unfairly attributed some quotes to Wade.  We can expect
additional
media interest Monday.

FYI, Jim Hughes has indicated that Ken Lay wants to advise the US Ambassador
before drawing the securities, so the probable timing for the draw is Monday
night
or Tuesday India time.

BOMBAY, Jan 7 (Reuters) - The Indian government has
asked the western state of
Maharashtra to work out ways to pay outstanding dues to
U.S. energy giant Enron Corp,
media reports said on Sunday.

Enron has threatened to invoke letters of credit (LC)
and the federal government's counter
guarantee.

"The state government has to work on the issue," the
Press Trust of India said, quoting
unnamed official sources.

The Economic Times on Sunday said that the lenders to
Enron's local unit, Dabhol Power
Company, were meeting on Tuesday in New York to discuss
the inability of the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) to clear its
dues.

"As a result of MSEB's mounting dues Enron said it would
be forced to invoke the LC," the
newspaper said.

The report said the MSEB had outstanding dues worth 2.62
billion rupees ($56.15 million).

Enron's local unit said on Friday it will lower tariffs
from next month in a bid to defuse
criticism that it charges higher rates for the
electricity it produces in Maharashtra state.

Last month, the Maharashtra government decided to review
the rate at which it buys power
from Enron's Dabhol Power, saying the high cost was
threatening its finances.

Enron is spending about $1.9 billion to build a facility
to generate 2,184 MW of electricity.

India, which needs to generate an additional 100,000 MW
of power within the next decade
to meet growing demand, is desperate to attract foreign
capital. But after nearly a decade of
liberalisation, Enron is among the few private power
companies to begin generating power
in India.


FIs in U.S. press panic button as MSEB fails to pay Enron

MUMBAI: Financial institutions in the U.S. have pressed
the panic button with Maharashtra
State Electricity Board (MSEB) defaulting on payments
for electricity it has purchased from
the Enron subsidiary, Dabhol Power Corporation (DPC).
The board owes DPC Rs 262
crores of which Enron expected Rs 114 crores would be
paid by January 6. The board has
thrown its hands up in the air saying that it is simply
in no position to effect the payment.
The situation has been vastly complicated with chief
minister Vilasrao Deshmukh plainly
refusing to bail out MSEB.

It is learnt that major lending institutions have
convened a meeting in New York on January
10 to decide a course of action to compel MSEB to cough
up the money. Indian lead
financial institutions__including IDBI, SBI and ICCI,
who have a collective exposure of $1.2
billion__ have also been asked to send their
representatives for the meeting. If MSEB does
not pay up by then, the institutions may decide to
invoke the letter of credit. The implication
is that lending institutions may seize MSEB's accounts
with them and adjust the monies
against the dues payable to DPC.

It is learnt that Enron has informed the U.S. embassy of
the intransigent attitude adopted by
MSEB and the state government. Incidentally, Enron was a
contributor to U.S.
president-elect George W. Bush's election campaign.

Sources close to Enron said the company might be willing
to restructure the power
purchase agreement (PPA) provided MSEB does not default
on its payments. But the
restructuring of the PPA may not be an easy task since
it will require the endorsement by
the Central Electricity Authority and the Maharashtra
Electricity Regulatory Commission.

The sources said the defaulting by MSEB and the stance
adopted by Mr Deshmukh will
have serious implications since a large number of world
financial institutions__like
Citibank, ABN Amro, Bank of America, apart from the
governments of the U.S., Belgium and
Japan__have financial stakes in the 2100 MW project. The
defaulting will also harm the
interests of several Indian financial institutions who
have lent money for the controversial
venture.

Enron is hoping that the BJP-led government at the
Centre may persuade Mr Deshmukh to
defuse the crisis. But if ultimately no payment is
forthcoming, Enron may act tough and
invoke the guarantee and counter guarantee given to the
project by the state and the central
governments respectively.

The deal with Enron was signed by Sharad Pawar when he
was the chief minister in the
early nineties. It was first scrapped and later
enthusiastically endorsed by the Shiv
Sena-BJP coalition which came into office in 1995. It is
learnt that Mr Deshmukh has been
asked by the Congress high command to adopt a tough
stand so as to embarrass Mr
Pawar__who is now in the Nationalist Congress Party__the
Sena and the BJP.

It is learnt that state finance minister Jayant Patil
informed Enron representatives that the
current situation was the outcome of coalition politics.
An Enron official countered this by
pointing out that a coalition of lending institutions
was involved at the other end of the table.






Enron ready to renegotiate Dabhol deal

US energy major Enron is prepared to renegotiate its
deal with the Maharashtra
government on the controversial Dabhol Power project,
but has emphasised that the new
deal cannot be a unilateral one.

This is the first time that Enron has publicly spelt out
its stand on the issue. Enron India
managing director K Wade Cline said, "The deal cannot be
a unilateral one. MSEB
(Maharashtra State Electricity Board) must continue to pay us for the
power purchased. We
should also be allowed to continue operating our power station at
Dabhol. Obviously, it
must be a deal that works."

The state government, Cline said, must remember that
just as it was important for it to sell
a deal to its various constituencies, it was important
for Enron to be able to sell it to its
various stakeholders.

"A renegotiated deal will mean that we will have to
convince the gas suppliers to rework the
agreement that we have signed with them. It also means
that we will have to convince our
lenders," Cline added.

The $3-billion project has an equity component of $1
billion and a debt component of $2
billion. Cline pointed out that the entire equity as
well as $1.6 billion in debt had already
been brought in. Domestic lenders like ICICI, IDBI and
SBI have contributed $1.2 billion.

"The Indian government has a huge exposure to this
project through the financial
institutions. The governments of Japan, Belgium and US
too have a stake in the project as
banks and export credit agencies of these countries have
a huge exposure," he said.

Dabhol phase II in danger as arbitration looms

Bodhisatva Ganguli & Girish Kuber
MUMBAI
THE MAHARASHTRA State Electricity Board's inability to pay the
Enron-promoted Dabhol
Power Company is rapidly emerging as a threat to the viability of
phase II of the Dabhol
project.

The project involves a generating capacity of 1,400 MW and an LNG terminal
of five million tonnes.

This is because there is an increasing possibility that the dispute over
phase I may end up in
arbitration courts if the MSEB continues to fail to pay up and the state
government refuses to bail out
the ailing electricity board. As a result, lenders may stop disbursing funds
for phase II.

Enron India,s managing director K Wade Cline said on Saturday evening that
international arbitration
was a real possibility.

The PPA allows for arbitration in case a dispute cannot be resolved through
negotiations. Enron
officials say they have made no headway so far in talks with the MSEB or the
state government.
Enron is also considering invoking the letter of credit and the state
government guarantee in order to
recover its dues.

We have no alternative since if we don,t get paid, then our lenders are
saying that they won,t fund
phase II, Cline said. If the Maharashtra government does not pay then the
central government,s
counter-guarantee could be invoked.

At a meeting on Friday evening, the MSEB is reported to have asked the state
government to provide
it a subsidy of Rs 130 crore per month. However, the Maharashtra Chief
Minister, Vilasrao Deshmukh
is said to have flatly rejected MSEB,s request.

The Maharashtra cabinet is meeting again on Monday evening. The cabinet will
also discuss the
formation of a committee to review the project.

The lenders to the project are meeting in New York on Tuesday, January 9, to
take stock of the
situation arising out of MSEB,s failure to pay part of the bill for October
and the entire bill for November
amounting to a total of Rs 262 crore.

The project,s lenders are reported to be extremely concerned about the
viability of the second phase of
the project in view of MSEB,s failure to pay for power bought from the first
phase.

Cline said that of the total second phase project cost of $1.89 billion only
about $400 million of debt
remained to be disbursed. About 80 per of the construction is complete and
95 per cent of the
machinery is on site.
