Alan -
My read of the report is that the MSC wants a 2 year fixed price (established
by some administrative procedure that works off of the natural gas index) for
small commercial and residential retail customers and then they want to force
all suppliers (SCs) that participated in the Cal ISO market in 1999 to meet
this physical and financial obligation [isn't that a taking?].
They only want the fixed price for 2 years because they want to capture the
downside opportunity in later years (real generous).
It seems that the same result could be had if the UDCs contracted forward for
80% of their small commercial and residential with people like us (or DENA in
SDG&Es case).
I don't know if we need to respond directly.  We may want to understand what
type of obligation this would put on EPMI and EES (how many Mwh) for 2 years
and try and figure out what our mandatory sales price would be under their
model?
Give me a call.
