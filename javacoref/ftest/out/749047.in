All,

Adrainne Engler is currently dropping resumes of Internal Analysts & Associates who responded  to the e:mail advertising the EGM Trading Track.   (some of these A&A are currently within EGM).

You will notice that some of the names who responded have an asterisk beside their names.   Pls note that this asterisk indicates a prc ratings below a 3.   Therefore we will more than likely not focus on these resumes (unless the EGM Management Team decides to approve an interview).

John  N - I will follow up with you to discuss the selection of candidates to be interviewed and finalise the interview dates.

Kind regards,

Karen.
