We faxed the attached comments today to OMB in response to their notice issued yesterday.  Because I did not see the notice about the deadline being yesterday until after 5:00 yesterday, we did not have time to send this out for a complete review, but Leslie did talk to Steve Kean about it and we incorporated his comments.  Our comments dispute the accuracy of FERC's estimate of the time required per respondent to comply with the requirements - 208 hours for the initial report and 3 hours for subsequent reports.  As we explain, because we don't manage our business in the way the reporting requirements contemplate, compliance will require manual review and analysis and FERC's time estimates are vastly underestimated from our standpoint.  FERC has asked OMB to make a determination by August 7th, so we felt it was important to get this to OMB as quickly as possible.
