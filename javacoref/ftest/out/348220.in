Without overselling this right now, (as I only received the information
through a source other than the utility),  It looks like EOG is going to make
some serious adjustments to their gas choice program.  Here is what I know so
far.  EOG is meeting with the marketers who are serving residential customers
behind their system  to try to get their support on their program ideas
before formally submitting it to the PUCO.  The following are the parameters
that I have received so far:
Voluntary Capacity Assignment
Local storage goes with the customer and is built into the base distribution
rates
Third party billing
If EOG does the single billing they will buy the receivables at 99%
Balancing and trueups will be monthly
Rollout process in June
Program would begin in September
Open the entire service territory
Rumor has it that this has been preshopped with Chairman Schrieber.  I will
be making a trip to Cleveland to discuss the details with East Ohio and will
meet with Rob Tongren (Ohio's Consumer Counsel) to get his insight on this as
well.   EOG is the second largest gas utility in Ohio and represents 1.2
million customers.
