The Public Relations department is looking for a few "quotes" from traders
(see below examples), to add
to their next Ameriflash Newsletter.  If you would like to submit one, you
can e-mail it to Michelle Vitrella.

The deadline to submit an entry for the next Ameriflash is Tomorrow at
2:00pm.  Anything turned in after
the deadline will be added to the next issues of Ameriflash.

Thanks,
Rain
