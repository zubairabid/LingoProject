Remember:

The free add/drop period will end on Wednesday Aug30 at noon.  After that
point, we will submit add/drop bids to Pat at pryder@enron.com.

To review:  add/drops will be done through an auction system.  If you want to
pick up a player you need to submit a bid by e-mail to Pat by 5:00 PM on
Wednesday of every week.  The person with the highest bid will receive the
player ($0 bids are acceptable).

Each team will start with $100 auction dollars.  Each week the team with the
lowest total points year to date will get $12 added back to their total, the
team with the highest YTD pt total will get $1 added back and teams in the
middle will get their according dollar amount based on their rank in YTD pts.


ALL TRADES WILL BE ASSESSED A $5.00 flat fee.


Also, let me know how you want to handle dues (a total of $110).  Should I
collect them up front ?
