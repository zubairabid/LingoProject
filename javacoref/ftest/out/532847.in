Regarding the one-pager we discussed today and for discussion in a later
call, I wanted to offer a suggestion on an approach. I,d like to see
something simple that uses headings to show what Enron has done, what
concerns  remain, and the steps you expect to take in the future.
I've put togethersome very rough sample bullet points (below) as a  start to
get everyone thinking and as an example of a format that could be
effective. A short preface should also be added to set up the bullets,
possiblysomething that says Enron has been working diligently to meet
elements of the committee's subpoena despite remaining disgreements.
What Enron has done:
Delivered x number of documents
Spent x man-hours compiling information requested by the committee
Retained a depository in Sacramento for documents
Negotiated in good faith on a continuous basis with the committee
Enron,s concerns regarding delivery of additional  documents:
The committee has failed to implement an acceptable confidentiality
agreement that includes sanctions for anyone who breaches the agreement
Confidential documents held by the Legislature -- such as in the  Quackenbush
case --have historically found their way to the press or  made public, often
in a selective manner
The broad nature of the committee,s request and whether requested  documents
are relative to this inquiry
Whether a state legislative committee has jurisdiction over activities  that
involve interstate commerce
What Enron will do:
