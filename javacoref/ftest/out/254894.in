I have not talked directly with Coastal about their specific approach, but am
aware of efforts to find tax relief for conversion of MTBE facilities to
alkalytes.   This is also an option that has been discussed in the OFA and
MTBE Producer groups.   It certainly could be a viable "fallback" position to
stranded cost recovery.

However, Coastal is very differently situated than Enron in terms of stranded
costs or liability protection.   Refiners can't make as good a case for
stranded costs as the merchant producers of MTBE who developed unique
facilites directly in response to the Clean Air Act oxygenate mandate.   On
liability protection, refiners and marketers are more directly responsible
for groundwater contamination with MTBE because they have the leaking tanks
-- so they have what could be characterized as "contributory negligence",
where MTBE producers do not.

I agree with Steve Kean's response -- going after liability protection is
probably going to be more viable than finding stranded costs.   We will keep
pressing both issues, and distinguishing ourselves as one of the "good
actors" that responded to the Clean Air Act to produce MTBE and has not
contributed to gasoline spills.

In terms of conversion to alkalytes, one of the complicating factors is the
"tax" angle.   In all the current legislative efforts in the House and
Senate, the sponsors are avoiding inclusion of tax provisions so that the
bills do not have to go through review by the separate tax committees, which
would delay the legislation probably to its demise.   Passing separate tax
legislation that contains alkalyte conversion provisions may also be
difficult -- in general, it will be hard for Congress to pass even modest tax
legislation this year.

If this emerges as a viable strategy, however, I think it is worth
consideration.   I will talk with Coastal to see what their strategy is and
follow up with you and Jim Prentice to see if it's appropriate to pursue.
