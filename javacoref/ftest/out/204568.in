Kern River discovered a mechanical problem with an oil seal at the Fillmore
Compressor Station in Utah. Fillmore will be inoperable while repairs are
made Nov. 30, but no impact to firm capacity is expected. However,
interruptible capacity will be reduced as necessary for the Nov. 28-29 gas
days and will not be available Nov. 30.

Northwest noted that despite putting its system into entitlement and issuing
a realignment OFO, primary scheduled volumes through Kemmerer (WY) Station
remain greater than physical capacity. Therefore, starting today the pipeline
is invoking a "must-flow OFO" provision of its tariff. Until further notice,
shippers with primary corridor rights southbound through Kemmerer are
required to flow up to 10% of their contract demand from receipt points north
of Kemmerer to delivery points south of Kemmerer or take some other mutually
agreeable action to alleviate the Kemmerer capacity problem. See the
Northwest bulletin board for details.
