Dear Tim,

1) All Regions' curves have been rolled out.

There is an issue with the Short Term Off Peak Curves on the 6 X 8 + 24 and 7 X 8 price convention. The interim solution is to copy and paste the Excel curves into the 7 X 8 column.

For Basis Offsets, a new window is being developed to allow copy and paste of the Basis Offsets from Excel to the new Curve Manager.

2) Resolved Matt and Jeff PC issue, they can now run the Curve/Position Manager locally on their PC instead of through Terminal server.

3) Requests to be in Next Release:

Volatility Smile curves.

Filtered Desk List in the Position Report window.

Delivery Points and MW Notional Volume in Position Report.


4) Requests under Research:

Undo functionality in the Curve Windows.

Refresh functionality without closing and re-opening the Curve Windows.


Arun will be here next Monday ( 5/7) to further assists all of you.

I shall be out of the office for the next two days, so if there is any questions in the mean time, please contact Arun at 713-853-7102.

Norman.
