Hedy, Scott, Bev -  the language currently says the bond surcharge will apply
"to all electric power delivered in California by electric corporations ..."
I know this is a longshot, but is there any chance of having this amended to
either
1) exclude volumes under DA contracts as of the effective date of this act,
or
2) more generally leave it to the PUC to adjust the surcharge for customer
classes based on their contribution - or lack thereof - to DWR's purchasing
requirements.
The justification for this exemption is grounded in excluding customers who
have not caused the DWR problem; e.g. large San Diego customers or PGE/SCE
customers who have been DA  the last couple years or parts thereof.  (We can
give you some specific language.)
Hedy or Scott - could you please call me when you get in - 713 853-5786.
Thanks.
