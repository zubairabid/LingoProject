Court Gives Green Light to Green Generator To Suspend Edison Contract, Sell
Electricity Elsewhere

EL CENTRO, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--March 22, 2001--A California court ruled
today that a geothermal energy supplier in the Imperial Valley can
temporarily sell its electricity on the open market despite its long-term
contracts with Southern California Edison, because Edison has breached the
contract by failing to pay for any output since Nov. 1.

Cal Energy Operating Corp. operates a complex of geothermal plants near the
Salton Sea. The plants filed suit Feb. 20 in Imperial County Superior Court
seeking back payment from Edison and authorization to suspend their contracts
with Edison and sell power elsewhere in California during such time Edison is
unable to pay for power demand.

David L. Sokol, chairman of Cal Energy, said, "We applaud this short-term
solution that will provide us with a revenue lifeline and keep our clean,
renewable power flowing to Californians. It is unfortunate that it took court
action to provide us some relief from an intolerable situation."

Sokol noted that the ruling did nothing to assure that the plants collect
approximately $140 million Edison owes them for power they have produced
since Nov 1. The geothermal plants will continue to pursue legal and
legislative remedies to receive back payment, he said. "That debt will
continue to place a great strain on our operation."

He added that Edison has continued to collect tens of millions daily from
ratepayers and has amassed approximately $2 billion in cash.

On the open market, the geothermal plants will be able to receive on the spot
market higher prices than renewable generators agreed to accept in
negotiations with the state, Edison and PG&E. That lower price had been
incorporated in Senate Bill 47X, which stalled in the state legislature after
Edison withdrew its support, and has effectively been incorporated in the
California Public Utility Commission's proposed order. California taxpayers
will pay the difference, because the state is buying electricity on the open
market on behalf of Edison and PG&E.

"It is unfortunate that taxpayers will now be paying more for our
electricity," Sokol said. "That is the result of inaction by the state and
bad faith by Edison. We negotiated with the full blessing and knowledge of
the governor and the legislature to arrive at long-term pricing that would
assure reliable supply and save taxpayers billions. This pricing for our
clean, renewable energy was less than the state is paying out-of-state
fossil-fuel energy providers in long-term contracts, and less than half what
we are allowed under federal law."

Sokol added that he was encouraged by the governor's March 20 announcement
proposing legislation and action by the California Public Utility Commission
that would require Edison and PG&E to begin paying current bills for
electricity received from qualifying facilities such as CalEnergy.

But, Sokol cautioned, "While we are hopeful that this legislative and
regulatory action can move forward quickly, there are many details to be
worked out in the governor's proposal. Even with quick action, there is a
serious question whether Edison is willing to pay any of its current bills
from qualifying facilities."

He noted that, like today's court ruling, the governor's proposal provides no
plan or schedule to require Edison to pay the approximately $140 million
Edison owes for power CalEnergy has delivered to date.

CalEnergy's geothermal complex employs about 200 workers and produces a total
of 268 megawatts -- enough to supply 268,000 homes.

Geothermal plants and other generation from renewable sources provide about
12 percent of California's electricity, enough for 5 million homes.
Geothermal plants produce environmentally friendly electricity from wells
that tap superheated water 5,000 to 10,000 feet underground. Magma rising in
fissures in the earth's crust heats the water to 500-700 degrees Fahrenheit.
The generating plants convert the water to "live" steam, the pressure of
which turns turbines to produce electricity. The plants then return the
slightly cooled water to the subterranean reservoir for reheating as a
renewable resource.

CalEnergy is one of 10 members of the Renewable Energy Creditors Committee, a
group of green power suppliers who formed the committee on Feb. 15 to explore
options to collect back payments from Edison. Together, the group is owed
more than $300 million by Edison.
