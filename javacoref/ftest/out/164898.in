Gary,on 11/22,the utilities filed their cost/benefit analyses  of various
transmission projects, their ability to build or contract for peaking
capacity for next summer, their ability to interconnect that capacity for
use  next summer and the costs/benefits of that capacity and any alternatives.

Yesterday they filed their required supplemental comments with regard to
which projects require an environmental review under CEQA and which do  not.

There are several procedural dates of which WPTF needs to be aware.  First,
a prehearing conference will be held on December 14. Prehearing  conference
statements are due on December 8. The original OII directed  that the ISO
and other parties may, no later than December 20, file analyses and  comments
on the utilities' November 22 filings (although this date could  conceivably
be delayed if parties were to so request at the PHC).

My question to you and the WPTF funders is......what role do we want to  take
in this proceeding? We have so far approved a simple $2,000 budget to
monitor the proceeding. I will prepare a summary of the utility's filings
and send it out. However, this budget would not cover attendance at the
PHC, filing a PHC statement or filing comments on the utilities'  proposals.

What is everyone's pleasure in this matter?
