We've experienced an unprecedented number of emergency situations during the past several months (weather, terrorist attacks, internet outages, etc.), all of which has been handled quite well by our market services group.  With the last two incidents being so close occurring within one week our Market Services Group has been worked to the limit.  So, if you have the opportunity, put in a kind and supportive word to a scheduler, take a gas controller to lunch, buy a customer rep. a drink (or two) , do what you can to recognize their efforts. Thanks
