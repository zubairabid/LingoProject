Justin,

Your solution appears to respond specifically to EOL related legal/credit issues.  However, isn't this only the tip of the iceberg?  What about non-EOL OTC trades conducted by ECTRIC traders with counterparties that want ENA as their counterparty.  From my time in London, it was always impressed upon me that there was a quagmire of additional tax and potential regulatory (SFA) issues.

Please comment.

Also, as a commercially efficient course of action, It has always seemed to me that we should attempt to "train" our couterparties to accept that ECTRIC is also a Enron Corp guaranteed sub (at least it was in the past, at their request) and somehow initially set up our contracts/ISDA to be inclusive of this vehicle.  Is this possible?  Otherwise, the permutations of various legal/credit/tax/regulatory hurdles for all manner of OTC trades becomes onerous.
