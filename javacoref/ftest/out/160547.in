I received this a.m. a copy of PG&E's testimony and their proponent's
environmental assessment (PEA) on the auction.  It is a foot of paper.  Let
me know if you would like a copy.  I will be reading and summarizing it.

Tomorrow protests are due on the auction proposal.  I will forward our
protest and IEP's protest as well.
