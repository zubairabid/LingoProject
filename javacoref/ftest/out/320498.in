Ann Elizabeth,
Attached is a form of interconnect agreement that was sent to Christi Nicolay
of government affairs for her review from a regulatory perspective.  She
forwarded it to me for legal review, but am I forwarding it to you since it
is connection with one of your projects.  In addition, Herman Manis of
accounting and Lisa Bills and Rose Engeldorf of finance need to review these
agreements from their acocunting and finance perpsectives.  I am currently in
the process of reviewing other forms of interconnect agreements with them and
will share with you what I learn from my meetings with them.  As of now, I
can say generally that the issues that they tend to modify are: (1) making
the interconnect agreement subject to a notice to proceed requirement which
we control the issuance of; (2) not having a parent or letter of credit
guaranty; (3) broad assignment language; and (4) limited indemnification
obligations.
