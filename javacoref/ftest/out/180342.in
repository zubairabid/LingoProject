The Second Extraordinary Session will begin Tuesday, May 15th to deal
with those legislative issues left in first session bills.  The
Legislature is still working on the exact process to convert first
sesssion bills into second session ones and maintain their status (if a
bill was in the second house, it would continue to be there).  We'll let
everyone know the new bill numbers and authors as soon as they are
known.
