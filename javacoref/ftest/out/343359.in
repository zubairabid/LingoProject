The IPP in Gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule.  This
combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in
Gaza and the first by a major Western company anywhere in "Palestine."  There
are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the
Secretary's visit.
1.  All equipment for the plant must transit Israel.  We have been assured by
the Israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it
is on the list of equipment we provide them.  That said, there are countless
opportunities for equipment to be delayed in Israel awaiting clearance,
whether on the list or not.  First power could be delayed indefinitely if the
Israelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons.
2.  Fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit Israel.  Again,
disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the
plug on power in Gaza.  Gas from Egypt has been discussed; it remains to be
seen if that will be a reality anytime soon.
3.  Although not officially from the Israeli government, we have been told
that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the
Israelis will turn off supply of electricity to Gaza.  The current
consumption is about 110MW.  The first phase of the plant will produce 40MW.
This appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby Israel
sells Gaza electricity to make up the difference.  That electricity is likely
to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; Enron could well
end up being blamed for the higher cost.
4.  Water is another critical issue.  The Palestinians want their own supply
of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated.  Israel is currently
selling water to Gaza; it is not in Israel's best interest to lose this
customer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project.
5.  OPIC project funding is problematical.  Since they originally invited
Enron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved.
Lack of OPIC support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up
costs.
6.  The Israelis must also "approve" the environmental impact of the plant.
The plant will meet or exceed World Bank guidelines, more so when operating
on gas.  While not a probem at this point, the Israelis could delay
construction/operation over environmental "concerns."
