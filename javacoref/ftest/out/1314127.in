It is my understanding that Jim Hughes will be talking with Ken Lay and Stan Horton today about issuing the transfer notice, which starts the valuation process for the Dabhol Power Company (DPC).  Depending upon their decision, the transfer notice may be sent as early as Saturday, but could be delayed for up to a month.  To prevent MSEB from trying to give this a negative spin, we intend to use the attached statement with the key India press.  At this point we do not plan to aggressively promote the story through a press release.  Any comments would be appreciated.
