Gentlemen -

We have had a last minute meeting confirmed with AEP in Columbus for tomorrow to discuss physical delivery to retail customers in their service territory.  We are specifically trying to negotiate an energy balancing service and load aggregation/forecasting.  As such, I will not be in tomorrow and will miss the site profile meeting.  Malik is on point, ready to go, and knows where I stand re: direction and expectations so feel free to meet and educate John on the process.  If you would like to reschedule, we could meet on Monday as Mallik is out on Friday.

Sorry for the late notice.

Rogers
