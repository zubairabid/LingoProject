No we are not planning to do a separate process around exceptions to
currently defined standards - Doug Imrie is acting as co-ordinator here in
Europe for reporting into Mike - we are awaiting the standard template for
consolidation in Houston ( I deliberately did not get my guys to set up their
own reporting stats !! ).
The below note is simply a PR exercise from John Sherriff to remind people
throughout Europe ( and especially in Commercial groups ) that fundamental
standards exist and must be followed ( He believes the message should be sent
given the turnover in staff and recent arrival of Metals to Enron Europe ).;
I am keen that the basis of the note IS consistent with our global views and
underpins our global reporting !!
