Hello all:

The time has come again for Bowl for Kid's Sake!  Entergy-Koch is sponsoring
the event this year which will raise money for the children of Big
Brothers-Big Sisters of Greater Houston.  BBBS offers youth mentoring
programs to at-risk children, and their goal is to match children from
single-parent families with responsible, adult role models.

Last year, our team raised over $1500, and this year our team goal is $3000.
The company goal is to raise $350,000 in total.  The minimum pledge per pin
is $.10 (100 score minimum), or a flat pledge of $10.  Either method works,
but be careful on the pledge per pin donation (I have been studying the
moves of Roy Munson and Ernie McCracken from the movie Kingpin).

If you are interested, please reply with your phone number, address, and
pledge amount (you will be billed directly in the mail by BBBS).

For those of you who are also interested in supporting our efforts in
person, the fundraiser will take place on Thursday, March 7th  from
2:00-4:30 at Palace Lanes, 4191 Bellaire Blvd (713-667-6554).

Thanks again to those who could contribute last year.  We hope to have just
as much success this time!
