Here's an update:

- We received detailed comments back from them on Monday, as reqd.
- We discussed these w/them, our legal and Morgan on Tues to clarify some items.
- Called them today to officially kill based mainly on the fact that in their response they had pulled the gathering system out of the collateral pool and proposed putting the gathered crude to the refinery at market rather than cost. This is a reduction of $5MM/yr in earnings and $10-15MM in collateral.
- After quite a bit of discussion today, it's clear they still want to get the deal done and are willing to revert back to having the gathered crude in at cost and as part of the collateral. The major issue is trying to find a structure in which they have some upside in the transaction beyond just the locked 1.4 coverage.

So...I said that if we get something in writing that puts gathering back in and satisfies our other reqmts, we will then try to revise the structure to give them a little more upside. Norman is traveling tomorrow and will get us something on Monday.
