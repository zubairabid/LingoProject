Gerald,
My suggestions/changes are in bold.  And not to sound like a broken record,
but, what should I do re sending Wildhorse something to inform them of the
contact list - names and phone numbers, and let them know where to send the
transport invoice to.  As I stated before, per my conversations with Becky at
Wildhorse, they need this information set up in their system before we nom.
Mark - did you find out if noms are officially due on Wed or Thurs?
