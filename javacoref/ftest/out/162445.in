The following is a summary of PG&E's CTC recovery:





So do you still feel sorry for PG&E.  Through July 2000, PG&E ratepayes have
paid for $3.9 billion in CTCs and PG&E shareholders face the risk of $1.1
billion.  Even if the ratepayers number gets reduce to $2.5 billion and the
shareholders number increases to $2.5 billion, should Californians feel bad
that they paid off half of PG&E's CTCs in exchange for frozen rates through
2001?  Although procurement costs are increasing, so are generation revenues
for hydro, nuclear, and QF contracts.  Additionally, what is the correct
value of hydro and nuclear assets.  If nuclear and hydro are valued correctly
and PG&E locks in next years prices, perhaps PG&E's shareholder may only be
at risk for $0 to 1 billion?  Would an 80/20 split between ratepayers and
shareholders for CTC liability be unreasonable?  Afterall, (1) PG&E has
delayed hydro valuation with its antics when they expected to overcollect
CTCs, (2) PG&E has been requesting astonishing increases to its T&D rates
which has resulted in squeezing headroom, and (3) PG&E chose the timing and
its assets to divest without hedging the risks; not to mention things like
irresponsibly telling customers to expect rate decreases despite their GRC
request.
