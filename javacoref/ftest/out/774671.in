Lizzette, Michelle,
Thanks for the quick turnaround.  Per your notation in file 101lmp.doc, attached is a copy of the memo that was sent out by John Sheriff and Michael Brown.  There is an added piece where our Commercial and Commercial Support leads of the office added their bit.
Also, please note that the calculation in the separation calculator was off so I've corrected and attached here for your reference.
Are we now waiting on Drew and Pat to come back with their comments of the documents?
Regards,
Cathy
