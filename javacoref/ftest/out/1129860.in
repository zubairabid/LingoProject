As a follow-up to our discussion when I was in Houston, attached is a memo that addresses how negotiated rate contracts will be treated in Transwestern's next rate case.  I had drafted the memo in response to numerous questions from BP regarding their Red Rock contract rate.  Pls. let me know if you have further questions.  Thanks, Maria
