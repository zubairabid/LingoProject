Topic: 
Pronoun usage across Gender and Hierarchical Position in an Organisation in addressing an evenly divided group in a formal setting



An analysis of the kind of pronoun used (neutral/masculine/feminine) across genders in different positions of hierarchical authority in order to address a group more or less equally divided by gender lines, i.e, in a Gender Neutral environment.



Assumption: 
People address their intended audience; so in a gender neutral email thread one would consider the even divide of gender, affecting their usage of pronouns.



Hypothesis: 
People in positions of authority use more gender-neutral pronouns in general, and women do so in particular.



Literature for hypothesis:
(Holmes and Stubbe, 2003) https://is.muni.cz/el/1423/podzim2012/SAN230/um/the_handbook_of_language_and_gender.pdf#page=589



Experimental Method:
 
Use the Gender Identified Enron Corpus provided by (Prabhakaran et al, 2014). 
 1. Identifying a gender neutral environment:
 Use a similar process as in (Prabhakaran et al, 2014) part 6.1. We'll work with the mixed data
 
 2. Pronoun Usage:
 For each participant in discourse, extract pronouns used and their reference[**Potential bottleneck**]. Remove any referencing specific people and choose those addressing the group at large. Classify as neutral, masculine, or feminine.
 
 3. Analysis:
 Most of the work seems to have been done, so plot it out and let's see what happens
