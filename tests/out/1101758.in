All,

Attached is a consolidated report of the service customers which sold energy to EPMI at a PX index price during the month of January,

There are a few items which need to be completed prior to us being able to pay the customers.

There are more customers on this report then need to be processed.

At this point please only process the information for the following customers:

Delano
Tosco
Arco
Wheelabrator

All Additional customers will be taken care of after I return to the Portland office on Monday.

Action Items:

1) Stan Cocke needs to get one Annuity per customer put into EnPower.  (Disregard each deal number and put an annuity in for the total customer Annuity amount at the bottom of their activity in the Pivot table.)

2) Stan Cocke needs to notify Audrey cook at the point when Annuity entries have been completed and provide everyone in this email distribution with the deal numbers which contain the annuity amounts for each of the above customers.

3) Based on my conversation with Audrey there should be no existing Annuities in EnPower for this PX index activity which need to be removed.

4) Audrey should schedule settlements with customer to occur on Tuesday 4/3/01.

5) Audrey should provide email back to everyone included in this distribution indicating the total amount being paid to each of the four customers for their PX index activity.

6) Mid Marketing will send out an email to their customer contacts to inform them of the settlement amounts and timing.

We need to take care of this today so we can get these customer paid by Tuesday.

If anyone has questions regarding the content of the worksheet or the action items which need to occur, please give me a call on my cell.  I will not be available after 5pm Central time.  So please make your call early.



Thanks - MO
