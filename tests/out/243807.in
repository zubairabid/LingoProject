I am not sure it solves matters.  Stikemans opinion points out:
1.  as I indicated this morning, "money" means actual currency - notes and
coins - not funds transferred by wire into an account, which would likely be
treated as an "intangible" resulting in the various requirements/concerns I
pointed to this morning regarding perfection by registration;
2.  although, in their view, the validity of the transfer approach would be
recognized by a court (in Ontario at least), given that the intention of the
Transfer Annex is to provide security for contingent obligations under the
Master Agreement and the lack of relevant case law, there is a material risk
that the Court would nonetheless characterize the transfer as a security
interest subject to the requirements for perfection.
With our present understanding, in the absence of any definitive case law,
and without an unequivocal opinion we can rely on, I am not sure we can rely
on the transfer approach to solve the problem, particularly with high volume
counterparties who likely are going to create the largest exposures.
