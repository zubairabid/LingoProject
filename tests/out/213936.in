Paul covers the coal group in the UK.  Peter has looked at some things for
coal elsewhere.  Doug Wood just did something with the paper business here.
With the new businesses, e.g., Global Markets/Industrial Markets, all of the
team will be expected to cover, within their geographic remit, those
businesses, until such time as it warrants a full-time/dedicated resource.
The memo could note that this geographic coverage will apply to other Enron
business units (within Wholesale Services, since EBS is covered separately),
but I would not go into much detail beyond that, as I think John is trying to
keep it Enron Europe oriented/focussed.   Is this helpful, or do you think
more still needs to be said?   mcs
