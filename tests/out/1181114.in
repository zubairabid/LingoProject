Please find attached a draft of the legal risk memo for the YPF GSA.  We
expect to be meeting with YPF to negotiate the form of their consent to
assignment to the lenders in connection with the project financing on
Tuesday, June 12, 2001 in Sao Paulo.  We expect to be in position to execute
the GSA and related agreements immediately thereafter, perhaps as early as
the evening of June 12th.



Best Regards,

EDD
