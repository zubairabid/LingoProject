Presented below is a synopsis of the 6.75 hour phone call yesterday.   The
primary short-term issue facing us is whether we wish to throw our name in to
be co-chair.    The only other marketer on the official committee is Dynegy,
Reliant is not on the committee but sat in.    The group generally agreed
that the co-chairs should be a financial player (bank, bond or CP) and an
energy company (QF or marketer).   After the phone call, I spoke with
Dynegy's general counsel John Herbert, who is their designated
representative.  He was going to check within his organization whether there
was appetite to serve today, but was not all that inclined, given his "day
job" as he put it.   I think we would agree that a marketer should be the
other co-chair as the QF's have a narrow agenda.  Here are some of the
plusses and minuses if we threw our name in:

+ Better access to information and guiding consensus
+ Ability to explain the necessity of long term contracts in the solution
- time commitment
- will we be more of a lightning rod?
