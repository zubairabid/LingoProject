Employees: Power supply held down

Three former San Diego Gas & Electric Co. employees who worked at a Duke
Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts,
withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up
the price of electricity.
State officials said the whistle-blowers' comments at a state Senate hearing
today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generators
held down production to inflate prices on the spot market. Gov. Gray Davis
has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and
utilities.
Jimmy Olkjer, a former assistant control room operator at Duke's South Bay
plant in San Diego, said in a phone interview that during the state's power
shortages, Duke cut supply. Although Duke, a Charlotte, N.C.-based company,
owned the plant, and it contracted with SDG&E to operate the unit, he said.
"Rather than creating more power, they were creating less," Olkjer said. "I
think there was manipulation of the market."
The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative
committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations, and
Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand jury
next month.
The generators have denied they manipulated the market.
"We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping
the power flowing," Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television
network.
But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken "down
for economics."
Ed Edwards, also a mechanic, said he was ordered to destroy 23 pallets of
working parts.
"We were asked, myself and other employees, to disperse of perfectly good
parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components," Edwards
said.
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the market-manipulation
committee, said his staff has been looking for employees or others with
intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward, and he promised
that others will testify at future hearings.
"It's the first time that we've had evidence from directly within power
plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generation
was a response to price and not to demand," Dunn said.
He said he would reach no conclusions until Duke and other generators testify
next month, but he added that the former employees' testimony raises
suspicions "at first blush."

Consumers cut their own power in protest
By Silvina Martnez
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 22, 2001)
When the temperature hit 100 degrees at 7 p.m. Thursday, Larry Lynch turned
off the air conditioner, unplugged the refrigerator, pulled out the TV cords
and shut down all other appliances in the house.
Lynch, a 61-year-old newsletter publisher in Sacramento, responded to the
"Roll Your Own Blackout" Thursday and joined thousands throughout the state
to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of
energy from 7-10 p.m.
But the data coming off the grid at the California Independent System
Operator didn't show the effort.
During the first hour of the voluntary shut-off, the demand for energy by
PG&E customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same time
Wednesday, ISO officials said.
Protesters didn't expect significant changes on the grid.
"I feel it will at least send a message that we don't have to depend on it
(energy)," said Jackie Bell, 37, a consultant at the Capitol joining the
conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue.
"It's just a symbolic act," said Peter Lopez of Sacramento, who decided to
use the evening to meditate. "Maybe I'll just go outside, stare at the stars
and try to spot a few constellations in the night."
It was the longest day of the year, and one of the hottest. But those
determined to advocate conservation didn't mind the sacrifice.
"People are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end," said
Joan Blades, a spokeswoman for MoveOn, a grass-roots organization in the Bay
Area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the
voluntary blackout.
An electrical engineer in Oakland started the "Roll Your Own Blackout" idea
when he posted a note in a political chat room in April. Then an artist in
Los Angeles forwarded the e-mail to a number of friends and from there it
quickly spanned the globe.
By Thursday afternoon, more than 12,000 people had signed up at the MoveOn
Web site to join the protest, Blades said.
Many threw blackout parties. In San Francisco, the nonprofit group Global
Exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach.
At his home in east Sacramento, Lynch did fine without electricity for three
hours. He ate tuna salad for dinner, watered the lawn and when it got dark,
he opened the windows and let some air in.
"We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices
go too high," he said.
ISO has not declared a power emergency since May 31.
"We have seen a consistent conservation on a day-to-day basis, and it's
making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts," ISO spokeswoman
Stephanie McCorkle said.
McCorkle encouraged initiatives like "Roll Your Own Blackout."
"People are conserving," she said. "And we can only support this whole
effort."

Davis consultants had contract with Edison: The disclosures turn up the heat
on the governor for hiring the ex-Clinton aides.
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 22, 2001)
Two consultants hired to advise Gov. Gray Davis on energy policy officially
disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday, but
Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because "Edison and the Governor's
Office have the same goal."
Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense
criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor's
public response to the state energy crisis.
The former Clinton administration communication aides -- nicknamed the
"Masters of Disaster" for their spin on the Whitewater, travel office and
1996 fund-raising controversies at the Clinton White House -- have come under
fire for receiving a six-month, $30,000-a-month contract, more than the
governor or anyone on his staff makes.
Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who is running for governor next
year, has called for an investigation into potential conflicts. State
Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, has said she will not issue
paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation.
The criticism mounted after the duo's economic interest disclosure forms were
released late Thursday, showing that each has received at least $10,000 under
contract from Edison in the past year.
But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility, saying
there's no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed
that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the
state.
Besides, she added, Edison and the governor are working toward the same goal:
Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding, a proposed
agreement, that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a state
purchase of the utility's transmission lines.
"It's not a conflict because there's been full disclosure," McLean said.
"Edison and the Governor's Office have the same goal, passing the MOU. We're
working together at this point with Edison."
But open-government groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion
that disclosure negates any potential conflict.
Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a
section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing
decisions if it would have "a material financial effect" on a business entity
that provided them $500 or more within the last year.
"You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been
on the Edison payroll and it's not clear to whom their loyalties are," he
said. "Just because they've revealed it doesn't mean there's not a conflict
there, and that they're not serving two masters."
On Thursday, Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political
Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connell's decision this
week to withhold payment from the consultants.
"This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were
hired and contracts were let," Jones said.
Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes there's no question that Lehane
and Fabiani are violating conflict-of-interest laws and suggested that the
two should be paid out of Davis' campaign funds, which had reached $26
million by Jan. 1.
Brulte, of Rancho Cucamonga, added that he would not vote for a state budget
as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll.
"The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths
$30,000 a month," he said. "I just wish (Davis) were as frugal with the
taxpayers' money as he is with his campaign money."

State deal may ease blackout threat
Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises
By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predicted
for this summer, thanks to a little-known power-swapping agreement with a
Canadian utility.
The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and August
from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia, despite a
serious drought in the Northwest.
California has sold surplus power in recent months to the government-owned
utility, which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up the
demand for electricity.
State deal may ease blackout threat
Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis
Despite the energy crunch, the state often finds itself with surplus power
that can be sold or swapped. For instance, advance power purchases that
provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any
given time, particularly during off-peak hours.
BC Hydro's reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an
electricity storage battery. By importing California power, BC Hydro has been
able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power for
California.
As a result of the agreement and other factors, state power buyers say they
are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had
expected. So far this week, the state has managed to get through a heat wave
without so much as a Stage 1 power alert.
"We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have been
as little as a month ago," said Ray Hart, head of the power purchasing unit
in the state Department of Water Resources.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, which last month predicted
260 hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer, has noticed a
change in recent weeks.
"We don't seem to have the crisis we were all expecting," said Ellen Vancko,
a council spokeswoman. "But whether that is a short-term or a long-term event
we don't think anyone knows yet."
Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high
conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power. Many
generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are now
back on line.
But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now.
Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week. But he
declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro, saying it could
hurt the state's competitive position in the market.
"If I start talking specifics," said Hart, "then I have to give out what I am
doing every single day, and I have no market position."
In the past, California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in the
Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat.
Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air
conditioning drove up demand.
Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because
California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared, and
drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest. But the agreement
with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer.
The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest
utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, were
unable to borrow because of a $13 billion debt. The rates that the utilities
could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan as
the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed.
Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro, which has demanded cash for some
electricity, that it could safely do business with California despite big
debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities.
"We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months," said Hart.
"It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues."
A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does not
release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements.
"Our first priority is taking care of our own," said Warren Cousins of BC
Hydro. "We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities
when we can."
Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Power
Authority, but again refused to provide details. He said the state has sold
surplus power to several buyers, including the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power.
Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until
recently. Gov. Gray Davis, pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling, released
edited versions last week of 38 long-term power contracts worth $43 billion.
The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information
because power prices have dropped, easing competitive pressures.
Ex-worker: Duke manipulated market
By Bill Ainsworth
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- A former operator at Duke Energy's Chula Vista plant said he
was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the
plant's output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices.
The operator, Jimmy Olkjer, said he was even ordered to cut power generation
during energy emergencies, when the state faced rolling blackouts because of
a scarce supply of electricity.
He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company
charge higher prices. "It looks like that's what they were doing," Olkjer
said in an interview.
He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the
company regularly operated its least-efficient turbine, possibly to justify
higher prices.
The allegations, which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing
investigating power generators, provide the first insider evidence that Duke
Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up prices.
Duke, based in North Carolina, leases the South Bay plant from the San Diego
Unified Port District.
A March report by the Independent System Operator, which manages California's
electricity grid, alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other
owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in
overcharges to California consumers.
Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy North America, said that varying the
output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do
with trying to achieve higher prices.
He said the changes in output helped balance the state's grid by "dancing in
the market" -- providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plant
to add or reduce power quickly.
Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts last
year as it did in 1994.
Olkjer served as a plant operator for 18 years, mostly when the plant was
owned by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. After Duke took over the plant, workers
were guaranteed their jobs for two years. In April, when that period ended,
Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers. Now he is retired.
During the two years Duke has managed the plant, Olkjer said, operators
frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in
Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule.
Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity posted
by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation, he said.
"We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down (our) megawatts would
go down," he said. "If the price was up, often the megawatts would go up."
Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant's
output up and down. When he asked, he said, company officials told him it was
none of his business.
Still, he was puzzled, particularly when he was told to throttle down the
plant during electricity emergency alerts -- as he says he did Jan. 16 when
the state declared a Stage 3 alert, with the possibility of rolling
blackouts.
"It doesn't make sense to cycle up and down when there's a Stage 3 alert," he
said.
Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of
the ISO during a Stage 3 alert because the grid manager can find cheaper
power somewhere else.
Lisa Szot, spokeswoman at the ISO, said she couldn't determine whether the
ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan. 16.
Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production, which sometimes
occurred every half-hour, wear out the plant's equipment.
"It's harder on the machinery," he said. "It's like driving down the street
putting your (foot) on the gas and then slamming on the brake."
Before deregulation, Olkjer said, the four units at Chula Vista, which have
the capacity to produce 706 megawatts, had been operated steadily during much
of their history.
S. David Freeman, formerly general manager of Los Angeles' Department of
Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov. Gray Davis, said rapid
cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment.
"We had almost 15,000 megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last
winter," said Freeman, referring to what industry experts agreed was an
extraordinary level of plant outages over several months.
SDG&E, which built the Chula Vista plant in the 1960s, sold it to the Port
District for $110 million. In 1998 the port leased the plant to Duke Energy
for 101/2 years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal.
The company pays minimal rent, but has made large profits. In the first
quarter of this year, Duke, which owns three other plants in California, said
profits rose 208 percent to $428 million from energy sales and trading.
Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity. It
asked $3,880 per megawatt-hour this year. By comparison, before the energy
crisis began, electricity sold for around $35 per megawatt-hour, an amount
which powers about 750 homes.
Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund $20 million to the
state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them.
In May, the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging
investigations, but Gov. Gray Davis declined.
Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr., who worked at the plant for 20 years before being
laid off in April, said they couldn't understand why Duke ran the
inefficient, high-cost turbine unit during the past year while other
generators sat idle.
They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price
for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran.
Williams, the Duke spokesman, said the opposite was true. He said Duke ran
the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive. It ran on
jet fuel, which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units.
Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed.
"It ran so frequently and so hard, it needed extensive repairs," he said.
Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were
prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts.
The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward
because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community.
"It kind of irritated me because you know there's people on a fixed income
that can't afford a big utility bill," said Olkjer.

Estimates of Power Profits Disputed
Electricity: A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed, state
officials say. Davis quoted the figures to Congress.
By DOUG SMITH, ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers
Gov. Gray Davis' contention that California has been nicked for billions
of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state
officials concede may have significant flaws, according to interviews and
confidential government documents.
Those costs--estimated by the state to be as high as $9 billion--were
central to Davis' testimony this week before a U.S. Senate committee, where
he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to "give us
back the money that was wrongly taken from us."
The governor's impassioned demand, however, was based on shaky
calculations. The formulas are being reworked, said Charles Robinson, vice
president of California's grid operator, which prepared the study.
Robinson said he "had no idea" how much the amount allegedly overcharged
by the generators might change. For now, he said, the agency stands by the
numbers.
But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator
warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged
excess profits could be well off the mark.
What's more, the documents caution against relying on the agency's study
as a basis for allegations of overcharging--as Davis did during his testimony
Wednesday. That warning was particularly important because the documents
provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy
supplier prospered from the state's power troubles between last summer and
February.
The largest amounts were charged by four out-of-state power companies,
according to the confidential Cal-ISO report. Okalhoma-based Williams Cos.
led the group with $860 million, followed by Duke Energy with $805 million,
Southern Company Energy Marketing (now Mirant) with $754 million and Reliant
Energy Services with $750 million.
When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them, executives of
the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of
Cal-ISO's poor methodology.
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company's entire energy earnings
for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping
unfairly in California.
"It doesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding up," Williams said.
"What [Cal-ISO] has done is highly irresponsible math."
Paula Hall-Collins, a Williams Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm would
need to study the ISO report further. But generally, she said, such reports
fail to fully account for electricity production costs.
"We maintain that we have not overcharged, and that we have operated
legally."
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures, saying,
"There's a lot of misinformation out of there."
A Mirant spokesman said: "We haven 't overcharged. We haven't
manipulated. We haven't withheld."
Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree were
outraged.
Joe Ronan, vice president for government and regulatory relations at
Calpine, said the $236 million attributed to his company "doesn't bear any
relation to reality."
"Anybody can throw out any number," he said. "It's like McCarthyism. . .
. Where is the evidence?"
A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimate
but defended it as reasonable.
"It's no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an
estimate of how much they're gouging us," senior advisor Nancy McFadden said.
Despite the cautions expressed in the Cal-ISO documents, officials
Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the
agency's figures as potential overcharges.
"The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a
competitive benchmark," said Robinson, who is also Cal-ISO's general counsel.
The first version of the now-disputed Cal-ISO study was made public in
March. It estimated that power sellers earned $6.3 billion in excess profits
between May 2000 and last February. The report, later revised upward to $6.7
billion, became a crucial element of the Davis Administration's campaign
against alleged electricity price gougers.
This week, just before Davis' appearance in Congress, the study was
updated again, adding another $2.2 billions in alleged excess profits through
May.
The orginal study, which did not include actual pricing data, was mostly
intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generators
that the state had been denied, Robinson said.
Thus far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds
of only $125 million. Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement
conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state, as well
as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars
by California utilities.
One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC
reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds. The
order stemmed from the company's sale of electricity at $3,880 a megawatt
hour--for thousands of hours.
FERC's order said Duke's pricing had resulted in $11 million in
billings. A fair price for that power would have been $273 per megawatt hour,
the agency said.
Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman, said the firm is willing to accept the
lower price. He said he company has yet to collect a dime.

Edison Plans Bond Offer at 13% Rate
Debt: Yield is about double what a credit-worthy company would pay, analysts
say. But will investors bite?
By JERRY HIRSCH, Times Staff Writer
Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling an
unprecedented 13% interest rate for $1.2 billion in notes to refinance debt.
Even so, it's far from certain that the Rosemead-based power company will
find enough buyers to complete the deal.
A failure by Edison to refinance $618 million in bank debt that comes
due June 30 and an additional $250 million in notes due in July could put the
company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on California's
plan to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to pay for power purchases, said Dan
Scotto, a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York.
"Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback, it would
really be a major setback for the state," said Scotto, who added that
Edison's credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California's
proposed bond offering.
Edison, however, said Thursday that the deal is moving forward.
"We believe our deal is going well, and we are comfortable with it,"
said Jo Ann Goddard, vice president for investor relations. She declined to
discuss other details of the offering.
Goldman Sachs Group, Edison's investment bank, expects to formally price
the offering Monday. Edison officials would not comment on the proposed price
of the note offering, but Wall Street sources said the power company was
shopping the issue at the 13% rate.
Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowing
power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to
insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit. The
utility, Southern California Edison, has lost billions of dollars on
electricity sales over the last year.
The high interest rate on Edison's proposed sale of seven-year notes is
about double what a credit-worthy company would pay for a similar bond or
note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars
in annual interest costs to the company's already strapped financial
condition, analysts said. It's a full two percentage points higher than the
average rate for other junk, or speculative, bonds. And corporate bonds with
similar ratings are going out at 9% to 10%.
Edison originally started marketing the issue at 12%, a full two
percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected, but then
raised the rate to 13% in recent days because it was finding few takers on
Wall Street.
"The word is that they couldn't get people interested and that they
might not be able to get it done," said Kurt Stabel, a money manager at
Street Asset Management in Newport Beach.
The higher rate, however, might be pulling investors out of the woodwork
and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal, Scotto said.
"This never promised to be a day at the beach," Scotto said. "I think it
is really a question of find the right price, the price at which people feel
comfortable with the risk."
Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edison's note offering is unusually
complicated and requires far more explaining or "selling" than typical
corporate offerings.
Mission Energy Holding Co., a company created by Edison for the sole
purpose of issuing these bonds, will offer the notes. The assets of Edison
Mission Energy, a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the
United States and in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, will secure the debt.
Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the form
of dividends, giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial
portion of its debt.
The notes will have a credit rating of BB-minus and come due in 2008,
according to bond rating agency Standard & Poor's. That's slightly higher
than the near-default CC rating now carried by Edison.
If the offering failed, Edison would face a series of difficult choices
that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and
begging for continued forbearance.
Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on $931 million in bonds and
notes. That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison
International and SCE, which has since operated under extensions from its
lenders.
Edison has about $3 billion in cash, including $2 billion held by SCE,
according to regulatory documents.
"This could all still unravel, but I have been impressed with [Edison's]
effort to inch along so far," said Ellen Lapson, an analyst at Fitch Inc., a
corporate credit rating service. "Who would have thought that they could have
lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be
in bankruptcy?"
Positive developments for Edison, including a deal to hold small
generators at bay with partial payments from SCE and progress at crafting a
rescue plan in both the state Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission
have sparked a small rally in the company's stock.
Edison shares have risen 8% this month. They gained 21 cents Thursday to
close at $11.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant
Power: Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision. The site is
proposed as a 1,200-acre state park.
By JOE MOZINGO, Times Staff Writer
In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners, an energy
company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power
plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills.
La Jolla Energy Development Inc., in a letter to the state Energy
Commission, said it was withdrawing its application for fast-track approval
of the 53-megawatt plant and "will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the
future."
"We listened to the community," La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in
an interview Thursday. "We need to find another place for this equipment."
The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker
Resources, an oil company that leases the land where the trailer-sized
natural-gas plant would sit.
Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether
they will pursue the project. "At this point it's just La Jolla pulling out,"
Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said.
But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the
fast-track schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis.
The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the
project today in Sacramento, but the hearing has been canceled.
The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners
who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods
and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together 1,200 acres of public open
space in the hills.
"We're getting ready to have the biggest party," said Tony Nicholas,
president of the hills' United Homeowners Assn. "This shows how a community
can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of
days."
About 76% of the residents in the hills are African American and many
saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice.
In addition, Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant
within 21 days of filing their application, under the governor's emergency
power orders. By following this fast-tracked procedure, they would have been
able to avoid the normal, time-consuming environmental review process.
That angered opponents even further, and nearly 1,000 people showed up
at a public hearing Monday to fight the project.
But what officials said turned the tide against the project--at a time
when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possible--was
testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his
agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly.
Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to
conduct hearings that would take up to 60 days, pushing construction well
beyond a Sept. 30 deadline set by the governor for fast-track projects. He
also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal
clean air laws.
In a letter to the Energy Commission this week, Wallerstein wrote: "It
appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until some
time in the first part of 2002 at the earliest." By Wednesday night, the
energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statement
recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a
plant, citing Wallerstein's concerns.
Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to
create a park was gaining steam. The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created
last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated
neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. With support from the governor and local
politicians, the state recently bought a 68-acre parcel in the area for an
unprecedented $41 million.
"This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have
worked so hard to bring this world-class vision to reality," said Esther
Feldman, president of Community Conservancy International and the main
organizer to build the park.
Also applauding La Jolla's decision were state Sen. Kevin Murray
(D-Culver City) and Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who had come out
strongly against the project. They and others questioned whether the small
amount of power provided by the facility--coming online after the dog days of
summer--would do much to relieve the energy crisis.
"I'm ecstatic" Wesson said. "At this point the environment has won."
The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about 650 feet
from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. And according to park
proponents, it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy, on
what would be a half-mile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard.
Rusch, the spokesman for Stocker, said much of the information
circulating about the trailer-sized plant is false.
The plan did not call for "a stack with billowing smoke," he said. "If
the issue is air quality, we've cleaned air quality up." In the last decade,
Rusch said, the company's existing 400 oil pumps on the property have reduced
nitrogen oxide emissions from 374 tons to 3 tons a year. The power
plant--with two 70-foot stacks--would ultimately add about 18 tons a year.
He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing its
own power to pump oil, while also contributing an extra 39 megawatts to the
state grid during the energy crisis.
Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve
the energy problem. Said Mary Ann Green, president of the Blair Hills
Homeowners Assn.: "We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the
outcry from the community."
Western states could feel pinch from California pricing

(06-22) 02:45 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --
When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer, who will decide
whether Silicon Valley computers, Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas
casinos get first dibs on what's left?
It's a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators this
week to cap electricity prices throughout the West, using a formula based on
California's power costs.
Economists, energy industry executives and officials in all 11 states are
beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle.
Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging,
others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for
California's neighbors, or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to
fend off shortages. That could diminish any leverage power buyers might have
as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day.
Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem
come winter, when power demand drops in the Golden State, said Gary Ackerman,
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents most sellers of
energy.
States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter
would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap, which is usually
determined by a formula based on the highest bid for last-minute power during
the most recent energy supply emergency in California.
That may leave power wholesalers, and not a free market, to decide who gets
the energy.
"Certainly, California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for
probably the last year," said Claudia Rapkoch, spokeswoman for Montana Power
Co., which supplies natural gas and electricity to two-thirds of the Big Sky
state. "What it means for this winter, we're just going to have to wait and
see."
California utilities had much more control over power supplies before
deregulation in 1996 obligated them to sell off their power plants to
encourage competition. This brought lower prices for a time, but gave control
over power supplies to wholesalers that aren't obligated by state law to
serve the serve the best interests of local customers.
Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power
in the West, Ackerman predicts utilities in non-deregulated states will
simply sell their power within their borders. That would hurt California,
which this week imported about 10 percent of its electricity and its
remaining supply from local plants owned by out-of-state power companies.
Price cap or not, utilities in the region will watch out for each other as
best they can, because they might need the favor returned, said Charles
Reinhold, executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz.
Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the state's budget,
California recently began to sign long-term contracts with generators. Gov.
Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce prices on the
spot market, which earlier this month fell below $50 per megawatt hour for
the first time in a year.
The long-term contracts, though, weren't cheap. California will pay an
average of $70 per megawatt hour during the next decade under 38 different
contracts signed so far.

Feds spurn Duke Energy in its bid to avoid refunds

Federal regulators have rejected attempts by Duke Energy Inc. to avoid
refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant
electricity prices in January and February.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March
9, and Duke responded by filing a challenge. But the commission on Monday
rejected the company's appeal and reiterated its earlier order, claiming Duke
had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for
$3, 880 per megawatt hour.
"We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or
behavior," the commission said.
Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged $3,880 per megawatt for
about 5,500 megawatt hours sold to the state's major utilities in January and
February, netting it more than $19 million in receivables.
The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund, but it
directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a
price of $273. From a FERC document, it appears that about 2,835 hours
occurred in January, which would result in a total refund for that month of
$10.2 million.
Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the California
Independent System Operator, the manager of the state's electricity grid, and
the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for
electricity.
Meanwhile, employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke
are expected to testify in a state Senate committee hearing today that the
company ramped production up and down. That allegedly was aimed at lowering
power production during shortages and attempting to drive up electricity
prices on the spot market.
The workers were employed by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. but were working
under contract to Duke.

Davis winning Washington PR battle
Price cap victory may rob Democrats of campaign issue

N167044.DTL&type=news
Washington -- There was a reason Gov. Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket
and endured beastly humid 90-degree heat this week in an area behind the
Capitol known as the "House swamp."
The nation was watching. And after months of political free fall, his message
seemed to be taking hold.
"California has been bilked out of $9 billion while the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch," Davis declared, repeating
testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the air-conditioned confines of a
Senate hearing room.
Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as 10 television cameras and two dozen
reporters recorded the scene, the California governor apparently couldn't
resist taking another shot: "For nearly a year I've been pounding on this
commission to enforce the law."
The state's energy crisis, with its volatile spot markets, out-of-state
generators and dearth of alternative energy providers, is a dizzyingly
complex policy puzzle. The politics are much simpler.
Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders, defending helpless
utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators.
Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and long-term
solutions, rejecting price caps and refunds as heavy-handed overreactions
with Soviet-style results.
The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle. Though the debate is
far from settled, the consumer-oriented approach to California's energy woes
has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in 2002
and the White House in 2004.
"Republicans are scared out of their minds about this," said one gleeful
Democrat on Capitol Hill, who suggested that the White House's lackadaisical
response to California's problems would rile consumers from coast to coast.
"This could rival Pete Wilson's alienation of Latinos," said the Democrat,
referring to the former Republican governor's strident stand against illegal
immigrants, which many blame for the party's weak standing in California.
A sign of the GOP's concern surfaced this week with television ads, financed
by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists, that blame
the Democratic governor for California's energy problems.
Democrats, who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second
term, now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal
regulators to take a more active role.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which had previously resisted such
efforts, took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday.
Later in the week, two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified
that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge
refunds to California. And just yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney, who
has been among California's most vocal critics, told Senate Democrats behind
closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal
regulators agreed, according to those in the meeting.
"There is no doubt in my mind that action (taken by federal regulators) was
the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the
California delegation," Davis said.
The pressure did not come only from Democrats. Republican lawmakers, some of
whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in 2002, wrote FERC last week,
requesting commissioners to "take further actions" to help the state.
The Democrats' public relations success follows an effort by the party to
raise the profile of its consumer crusade. Hardly a day has passed in the
past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference to
attack the White House, the Republican controlled House or FERC for inaction.
But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far more
focused on long-term energy production than the immediate concerns of
Californians. Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to
solve the power mess, the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the
plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling
blackouts.
Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month.
But the damage appears to have extended beyond California.
A CBS News/New York Times poll released this week of 1,050 adults from across
the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush was
doing on energy. More than half the respondents said that protecting the
environment was a higher priority than producing energy, yet barely one in 10
said that Bush shared that priority.
Some Republicans say that Bush was in a no-win position, contending that
anything he did would have been attacked by California's opportunistic
governor.
"Politics is (Davis') main objective, and I don't see the Bush administration
being that way," said Rep. George Radanovich, R-Fresno.
The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too
successful. By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role,
Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient
scapegoat.
"Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat. Now
that FERC has given him what he wants, or close enough to it, it's a lot
harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in,"
said Dan Schnur, a GOP analyst based in San Francisco.

Suit filed over report on power lines, health
Deal on transmission grid could raise liability

N114037.DTL&type=news
As state legislators consider Gov. Gray Davis' deal to buy part of the power
grid in California, a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterday
demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of
living near high-voltage transmission lines.
The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the $2.76 billion deal
to buy Southern California Edison's power lines, said Terry Francke, general
counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, which filed the lawsuit
in Alameda County Superior Court. The power line deal was brokered by the
governor to help the cash-strapped utility.
Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug. 15 or the utility
can back out. Davis also has a $1 billion agreement to purchase San Diego Gas
and Electric's power grid, which also would require the Legislature's
approval.
Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines.
The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and
Magnetic Fields Program, an agency set up by the state Department of Health
Services to study the issue, Francke said. Both state agencies and their
directors are named in the lawsuit.
Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect, Francke said.
"If it's known there's some danger . . . do you want the state owning that
liability?" he asked.
The study began in 1993 after the state Public Utilities Commission committed
$7.2 million for research and education on the subject, Francke said.
The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and
electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies
based on those findings, he said.
The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May 7, but "at the
last minute, the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staff
of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret," the lawsuit said.
State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a
draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC.
"The PUC wanted to see the draft before (it is released)," she said. "We
prepared (the report) for them. We are following their request."
Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit, saying her office hadn't seen it. PUC
officials were not available for comment.
Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consensus
on their effects, Francke said. That's what makes the state study important
for legislators to consider before voting on the governor's deal to buy
transmission lines, he said.
Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to
Davis' agreements with the utilities. Some legislators would rather the state
help build more power generators in California.
"They are extra nails in the coffin," said James Fisfis, spokesman for state
Assembly minority leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks. "We have fundamental issues
with the transmission lines, but when you start stacking these items up,
you have an undigestible deal."
Davis' spokesman Roger Salazar said he believed the governor hadn't seen the
health hazard report.
"Obviously, if something pops up and is an issue, you'll take a look at it,
but I don't think we're at that point yet," he said.
An Alameda County Superior Court judge will hear the lawsuit on July 23,
Francke said.

Texas power firm's shares falling
Power baron Enron finds fortunes fading
Christian Berthelsen, Chronicle Staff Writer

U178338.DTL&type=news
There's trouble in Texas.
Enron Corp., the Houston power firm that's profited mightily during
California's energy crisis, is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on
Wall Street.
While all eyes have been on Enron's enormous profits here and its enormous
pull in Washington, D.C., the reputed titan of the newly incarnated, free-
wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization -- more than
$30 billion -- since its peak in August.
Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston
boys' reversal of fortunes. But what gives? Isn't this the company that was
fattening up on the backs of the state's beleaguered utilities, residents and
state budget? Isn't this the company with such close ties to the Bush
administration that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, was reported to have
interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his
company?
Yup. That Enron.
On Monday, Enron shares hit a 52-week low of $43.07, after the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power
marketers such as Enron that had applied to power-generating companies for
months. That's a far cry from August, when the company's shares peaked at
$90.
"There's a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with
in the marketplace right now, none of which on the surface is a major deal,"
said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in
Houston. "But when you combine them all . . . I think what's happening here
is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement. You have people saying,
'OK, the growth rate is now in question.' "
That growth rate was an eye-popping 88.82 percent in revenues for the United
States on a two-year average, and nearly 98 percent in the rest of the world.
Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews, but as the stock
continued to drop Tuesday morning, chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a
statement to the markets in which he reiterated "strong confidence" in its
earnings guidance. The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week, closing
at $44.05 yesterday.
In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night, Skilling blamed regulatory
interference with the "free market" for investor flight from his company.
"Our stock prices have gotten hammered," he said. "They're half what they
were a year ago."
Tumbling stock prices weren't the only bad news for Skilling last night. A
protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began
speaking. As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face, a
woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges.
Enron isn't the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with
California's power crisis and are now suddenly headed south. Shares of
Reliant Energy Inc., AES Inc. and Williams Companies Inc., which generate and
sell electricity in California, and El Paso Energy Corp., which sells natural
gas here, are all trading near 52-week lows.
The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington about
power price controls, re-regulation and now, the possibility of big refunds
being ordered for California. Even Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which has
developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played the
spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics, dropped nearly
7 percent yesterday, to $37.10. But none of the companies has been hit as
hard as Enron.
Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any
company. It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth, and because
executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price, a sharp decline
makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders.
While Enron's power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine, the firm has
been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regions
in recent months. In the financial press, the continuing knock on Enron is
that its business lines are so new and complex, and the company is so
secretive about its operations, that analysts and fund managers don't feel
confident in their understanding of what it does.
A look at the firm's recent troubles exemplifies its diversity.
For instance, Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state government
of Maharashtra in India over a 2,184-megawatt power plant there. The Dahbol
Power Co., which is 65 percent controlled by Enron, stopped construction on a
second phase of the project on Sunday, claiming it is owed $48 million by the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The state has accused Enron of charging
too much and not generating enough, and stopped buying power from the plant
last month.
Closer to home, Enron has struggled with its investments in fiber-optic
bandwidth. The company buys and sells unused, high-speed bandwidth space,
treating it like a commodity as it does electricity, coal or natural gas. But
the fiber-optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear
that for all the long-distance cable laid in the ground, there have not been
enough "last mile" connections set up for users to actually take advantage of
it. Earlier this year, Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with
Blockbuster to offer what it called "video on demand," in which customers at
home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it
transmitted via fiber-optic cables.
Then there was the FERC ruling. For months, the agency had resisted
aggressive price controls in the West, preferring to let the market run its
course. But as control of the U.S. Senate was handed to Democrats this month
and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III
to the commission, the agency changed its tune. It expanded price controls to
all hours of the day, spread the controls throughout the Western region and
brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent.
So under current calculations, that means Enron could sell power for no more
than $108 per megawatt in a shortage and about $90 during normal hours -- far
short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging
during the past year.
In part, the company's gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of
the businesses Enron has decided to pursue. And the hard-charging company has
a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets. But sometimes
that approach gets it in trouble, as was the case last year, when Enron had
to take a $400 million charge for its failed investment in Azurix, a global
water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same
way it had done for electricity service, as governments privatized their
water systems. The opportunities never materialized.
Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a price-earnings
ratio of nearly 39, considerably above the liberal standard of health, which
is 25. The company had less than $1 billion in profits on more than $100
billion in revenues last year. Still, a survey by Thomson Financial/First
Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of 42 cents per
share in the second quarter (up from 34 cents last year), and $1.79 per share
on the year. Most maintain a strong "buy" rating on the stock.
But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit. Hardest-put of
them will be the Janus funds, which, as Enron's largest mutual fund investor,
held nearly $3.33 billion of its stock as of the end of April.
In a semiannual report to investors, John Schreiber, a portfolio manager,
said the stock price of the "new-age energy merchant" was a victim of
negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis. Janus
declined to make fund managers available for interviews.
"There are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets," said Raymond
Niles, an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "When you're
an aggressive first-mover, from time to time you're going to make mistakes.
But I don't think any of the mistakes Enron has made hit the core of the
company."

Power firm accused of price-fixing
Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create
an artificial shortage, boost profits
BY DION NISSENBAUM
Mercury News Sacramento Bureau
SACRAMENTO -- One of the largest companies producing power in California
ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effort
to drive up the price of electricity, former power plant workers said
Thursday.
Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing, the three
men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer --
Duke Energy -- sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage
that may have created huge electricity price spikes.
``Their intent, in my opinion, was to boost the price up,'' said Glenn
Johnson, a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power plant
now run by Duke. ``If I've got the only box of penicillin in town and you're
sick, I can charge a million dollars a box,'' he said. ``If you want to live,
you're going to have to pay.''
Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations, calling them
irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April.
``Their allegations are just comical, just highly erroneous,'' said Tom
Williams, a spokesman for Duke, which runs four plants in California that
produce enough energy for nearly 2.6 million homes.
The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with
generators over the $8.9 billion the state claims its consumers have been
overcharged. Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., came under considerable
criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record $3,880 a
megawatt-hour for power in January. Federal officials have called the charge
unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money.
The employees, who first made their allegations public on ``CBS Evening
News'' Thursday night, will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis
hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been
illegally gouging California.
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, chairman of a committee investigating
price gouging, said the allegations raise serious concerns. ``While we still
need to hear the other side of the story from Duke, if there's any truth to
the information, I believe it would be devastating to the generators,'' he
said.
`Perfectly good parts'
In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night, the three former plant
workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and
throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full power
for weeks.
Ed Edwards, who worked in the Southern California plant, said that he was
told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts. Edwards said he tossed
more than 23 pallets of parts into a dumpster.
``I don't know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts,'' he said.
``It didn't make sense.''
Johnson said the lack of on-site parts prevented workers from quickly fixing
