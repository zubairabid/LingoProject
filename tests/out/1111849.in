This document, although lengthy, contains insight to what NERC's BOT may be
asked to endorse as far as establishment of a NERC position on reliabilty
standards and market practices.  It also has implications on how to split the
baby between NERC and GISB.

I suggest all to review this draft and be ready to provide the MIC feedback
when it appears on their agenda.  I am unsure if it will show up in the July
meeting, perhaps Terry Lane of Dynegy, who is on the subcommittee that put
this together can provide us with more info.

Mark, please forward this to the EPSA-NAERO group list.

Thank You
