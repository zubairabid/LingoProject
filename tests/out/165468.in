The ISO filed a response at FERC to the PX's request to remove the hard cap
on adjustment bids and
replace it with a floating cap that would track the price of energy in the
market.

The ISO opposes the proposal arguing that it may produce extremely high
constrained Zonal market clearing
prices in the forward markets and may be subject to the exercise of market
power and to gaming.

The ISO suggests the PX fix this by anchoring its Adjustment Bids
(incremental and  decremental bids) prices
to the unconstrained market clearing price, as opposed to absolute Energy
bids.  In other words, the PX would
establish its constrained market clearing price as the sum of the
unconstrained market clearing price and the
Usage Charge resulting from the ISO,s Congestion Management process.

To effectuate this change, the PX would have to impose a new rule that
Adjustment Bids be within $125 of the
unconstrained market clearing price. The PX would then be required to process
the Adjustment Bids prior to
passing them on to the ISO. The PX would have to subtract the unconstrained
market clearing price from each
Adjustment Bid prior to submitting it to the ISO. The ISO would then utilize
these Adjustment Bids, as well as
those submitted by other Scheduling Coordinators, to run its Congestion
Management system. After the ISO
completes its  Congestion Management process, the ISO would then
"post-process" the Adjustment Bids
(add back the unconstrained market clearing price) for use by the PX in
establishing its constrained Zonal
Energy prices and, as needed, by the ISO in real-time Congestion Management.

The ISO says it does not intend, by presenting this alternative to the PX,s
proposal, to preclude consideration
of other solutions that may be presented by one or more of the utilities or
by the EOB.

The ISO also argued that the Commission should impose reporting requirements
on those entities who submit
Adjustment Bids in the ISO,s Congestion Management process.  It recommends
that the Commission require
the submission of all Adjustment Bids to the Commission, the ISO and the
EOB.  It also asked the Commission
to direct the PX Market Monitoring Unit, in concert with the ISO,s Department
of Market Analysis, to increase its
monitoring of Adjustment Bids and bids submitted in the PX forward Energy
markets for evidence of the
exercise of market power.

The ISO argues that the effect of the FERC's December 8 Order on supply
sufficiency in the ISO,s real time
Imbalance Energy market was immediate and beneficial.  It states the
following in support.  Although supply
in California is still very tight, after implementation of Amendment No. 33,
there were bids available in the ISO,s
"BEEP Stack" to address California,s real time balancing needs for the first
time in nearly a week. Immediately
after the order was issued 3000 to 5000 MW of Generation internal to
California and up to an additional 1990 MW
of imports became available to the ISO.  The following day there was only one
hour in which reserves dropped
below 6% and one hour in which reserves were as great as 10%. In addition, it
alleges that the implementation
of Amendment No. 33 has substantially relieved the burden which had
previously been placed on the ISO,s
operators by in-state Generators attempting to negotiate prices in real time
in response to ISO Dispatch instructions.

The ISO also requests that the Commission clarify its December 8 Order to
confirm that sellers submitting bids
above $250 in the ISO,s Imbalance Energy Market are required to report their
bids and provide cost information
on a weekly basis not only to the Commission, but also to the California
Electricity Oversight Board and the ISO.

The ISO requests clarification that the Commission intended to approve the
proposed December 12,
2000 effective date for the cost allocation elements of Amendment No. 33.
