BRUSSELS, Aug. 7, 2001 (paperloop.com) - UPM-Kymmene has unveiled details of the Euro 60 million ($53 million) PM 1 and pulp line rebuild at its Rauma mill in Finland. The revamp of the mill's integrated pulp line will boost mechanical pulp capacity from 1,500 tonnes/day to 1,700 tonnes/day.
The company has not yet chosen the suppliers for the scheme but expects to reach a decision by the end of October this year. UPM-Kymmene has already started planning work for the scheme and installation is due to kick off next year. The rebuilt PM 1 is scheduled to restart at the beginning of 2003. The additional pulp output is slated to come on stream during the second half of 2002.
The integrated pulp line feeds PM 1 and the mill's other three machines. The Rauma mill's pulp production has lagged behind while the PMs' capacities have risen during the past few years without major investments. The extra pulp output will enable the units to boost their paper production.
The details of the pulp upgrade have not yet been hammered out, but the plans for the PM revamp have taken shape. PM 1's press and dryer sections will be modernized and the coaters will be rebuilt. The PM 1 revamp will raise the machine's high-brightness lightweight coated paper (LWC) capacity from 250,000 tonnes/yr to 300,000 tonnes/yr.
The Rauma mill has a total capacity of 1,140,000 tonnes/yr of magazine paper. PM 2 produces 250,000 tonnes/yr of supercalendered (SC) paper, while PM 3's SC capacity is 240,000 tonnes/yr. PM 4 churns out 400,000 tonnes/yr of LWC.
