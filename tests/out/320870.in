Waiting on response from your people about :
Meeting with adjuster about going after SWPC.
Hiring engineering expert to hopefully refute underwriter's surveyor's
opinion.

Have written letter to ship owner to extend time for filing suit (this
protects the subrogation interests of the underwriter).

Seeking clarification as to policy requirement of filing "suit" against
underwriter within one year of occurrence.  Broker feels that this is not
necessary as the claim was filed and is currently pending, but will get
written clarification from underwriter/adjuster.

Carlos Sole to contact New Orleans attorney who represents SWPC underwriter
about joining in their suit against ship owner.

If any one above has anything else to add, or corrections to what I have
listed above, please add at this time so we are all on the same wave length.
