Beverly was given administrative rights, since she worked from home and that is why she has not experienced any problems. But, the rest of the team has experienced  some of the same issue you guys have. Kathy Royal with El Paso has their IT person working with Jean McFarland on our side to try and resolve these issue by the Jan. 6th deadline. If you have further questions or concerns, please ask. Thank you.
