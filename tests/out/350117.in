Greg - Mark is correct that Terry no longer controls these budgets, this is a
carry-over from last year that we'll need to get corrected.  The majority of
the difference between the allocations for 2000 and 2001 is for the
Environmental Health & Safety group under Mike Terraso.  Mike is out of the
office this week, but I'll follow up with his direct reports to get a
description of the allocation for each of their cost centers.

As the Project Finance allocation is flat from year to year, I'm guessing
that it isn't the issue you're most concerned about.  Please let me know if
this is not the case.

I'll be forwarding more information to you shortly, as I receive it.

Elizabeth Linnell
