Rod,
David Port is probably best suited to address your first point.
In response to points #2 and #3, we have discussed with Bill Valach and his team their positions in California and continue to incorporate them in our overall corporate exposures reported to management.  We also continue to discuss with him the entire credit situation in the West and any actions ENA may take.  I will call Bill Valach to insure this dialogue continues given the current standing of the divestiture.
I hope this helps.
Bill
