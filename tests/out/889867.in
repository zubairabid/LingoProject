Molly - WGL's tariff allows them to demand collateral acceptable to them (cash, l/c, bonds) if we do not meet their credit qualifications (pp. 42-43 of MD tariff), which we don't.  The security requirement they have calculated (contained in Craig's earlier e-mail) of $1.0 million follows a process that is used for all gas marketers and was approved through the "Gas Roundtable" in MD, a cross-sectional group of industry players in MD.  In other words, the MD Commission would uphold this calculation.
I talked to Frank Donnelly, financing director, and Shelley Jennings, corporate treasurer, of WGL about the calculation.  Nearly all of the collateral is related to "delivery risk", which is 60 days of peak day usage, reduced by about 50%, priced at a forward NYMEX price.  This is not terribly unreasonable, and as I say, it would be acceptable to the MD PSC.
I told Frank and Shelly we'd let them know, one way or another, our response by this Friday.  Thanks.
