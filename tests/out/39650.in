Executive Summary
Marion Horna and Kurt Anderson requested an explanation of how the EW 1.5
Availability was computed.  In addition,  Barry Riffe and Jeff Duff have
expressed concerns that there is confusion between the EW 750 owners, I.E.,
and EWC on how to categorize (OOH, UAH, or other) the direction curtailment &
windshear curtailment for availability computations.   The attached memo is
the result of a throrough review of the Exhibits in the 1.5 contracts that
define availability and the UAH & OOH clauses which are similar between 1.5
and 750 project contracts.  This memo doesn't include a thorough review of
the Technical Specs or Germainisher Lloyd design recommendations for 1.5
projects.  This draft memo proposes that:

1)  EWC should not be penalized for direction curtailment and windshear
curtailment losses to availability IF that curtailment is in accordance with
the Tech Spec of Germanischer Lloyd recommendations or requirements.
Neither the UAH term or the OOH term in the contract apply.
The corrections applied to correct for windshear in previous EW 750 reports
were made to compensate for the limitations of controller counters.

2) Only those Offline Hrs ordered  by the organizations specifically
mentioned in the OOH clause in the contract should be included in the OOH
term in
the contract.  For example, if the owner is not specifically mentioned in
the OOH clause then their orders for offline turbine should not be included in
OOH.

The availability resulting from this computation will not penalize
availability for all reasons that the turbine didn't produce power in good
winds.  There will be events that prevent turbine production but do not lower
availability, ie.  high winds, direction curtailment.
