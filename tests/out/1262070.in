I apologize for sending a mass email.  A few of you have tried to reach me
the last few days by phone and mail and I have been working all but the a
few hours a day that I sleep or play outside.

I have taken on two part time jobs in addition to Deer Valley. I have
started working at the internet cafe...since I used to be here a lot of the
time anyway.  I worked last night from 10-2am after my DV shift.  I waited
on my first celeb..albeit one that only I would
recognize....http://www.eonline.com/On/People/kmetko_pic.html....pretty
funny...he tipped me .50 on 2.50..ha.  The town is loaded with intense
looking film types with their dark rimmed glasses...north face down jackets,
cell phones and ski caps...its pretty funny.  This morning I went for a jog
around down town....I walked down Main st. on my way back and there are all
these people getting photographed along the street...you look at them and
try to figure out if they are famous but they all look like any other guy.
The cafe is a hub for a lot of the news media to send out their stories and
photographs of the fest.  There are 25ish computers in this cafe and all are
being used right now..it is crazy.

I also started work at Windy Ridge Cafe
