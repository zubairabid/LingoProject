Dear Western Government Affairs folk,

This message is to request you check your calendars and your availability for a western region meeting in Portland to be held on Monday October 1, starting at 12:00 PM through 6PM and Tuesday October 2 from 8:00 AM through 12:00 PM.  Please let me know whether or not you can make the proposed dates.  (Lysa and Debra, can you please check Paul and Tim's calendars for their availability?)

For those of you who had planned on attending in September, I am sorry to again cause you this inconvenience.   Hopefully for everyone who wanted to attend, but couldn't, this will offer you the opportunity to participate on October 1 and 2.

Due to the volume of new policy related issues in our region since the meeting was originally scheduled, I would expect there will be some modifications to our previously distributed agenda below.  When  you have an opportunity, please review the agenda below and send any updates to me asap so I can formalize the agenda and distribute it to the group.


Dear All,

As a result of the recent volume of activity in Washington DC, with mediation proceedings, refund discussions and the need for key members of our team that need to attend these meetings, it has been decided to re-schedule the meeting of the Western Government Affairs group to Wednesday, September 12, in Portland, 10AM-5PM.

For those of you who had planned on attending, I am sorry to cause you this inconvenience.  Hopefully for those of you who wanted to attend, but couldn't, this will offer you the opportunity to participate on September 12.

Due to the volatility of policy related issues in our region, I would expect there may be some modifications to our current agenda below.  As these changes occur I will communicate this information to you.

Any questions or concerns, please contact me.

Kind Regards,

Dave
