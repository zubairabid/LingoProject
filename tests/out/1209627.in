Simon - Justin tells me that in his view there are no issues from a UK
legal/regulatory point of view , other than the following:

As a matter of 'best pratice', the broker(s) concerned should mention
somewhere in their terms and conditions that their 'commission may or may not
be shared with third parties' in order to comply with SFA rules

Hope this helps.
