Bob,
Thanks for the note-I know we can all appreciate the need to speed up the process, but typically, initialling standard agreements is not where the slow down comes-Legal was not aware that the  standard agreements were being treated any differently than those more negotiated. Legal had authorized Donna Greif's group to originate and send out the standard agreement, but Legal's one check of those was to be through the initialing process--I know Shane was aware of this and has made every effort to comply--perhaps you and Barbara should discuss whether the process should be changed going forward, but until that time, all TPA's and their amendments should continue to come to us before execution.
Thanks very much--
Sandi

Let me clear up this process.
Suzanne is only looking at the TPA's that are standand/model agreements which had been
pre-approved by legal.
If there are any changes to the model that has been approved, then legal will have to sign-off.
If this is unacceptable, please let me know.
We were only trying to help speed up the process.
Suzanne was not initialing as legal, but as operations rep that there were no deviations
from the model agreement.
Hope this helps.
