John--this is the recap from Thursday afternoon of RTO week.  Although Andy did not focus on it in his report, there was an individual who sat on the panel from Missouri that did a fantastic job of supporting FERC and market postitions despite the fact that he is a public power guy.  His name is Bill Burks and he is the Associate General Manager of the City Utilities of Springfield, Missouri.  In his comments he stated that his utility was "wholeheartedly supporting FERC moving forward to push for on RTO" and then went on to talk about how Missouri is going to continue to suffer from seams issues if FERC doesn't stick to their guns on just a few major RTOs.
He stated that "flexible" standardization would not work and that the FERC should put out a platform of standardized tariffs and if there was some utility or group of stakeholders that thought they were special or unique or different, then the burden of proff should be on them to petition FERC for an exemption, not the other way around.
