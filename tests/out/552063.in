i went ahead and put a deposit down on the room.  with tax it will be
$517.75/night.  if we have 7 people paying that will be $222/person.  if
max's bro in law doesn't go it is about $260/person.  the deposit i put down
is for one night so if anyone wants to cover some of their costs they can pay
me.   so IT IS ON now.  sept 6th-sept9th.  i say we get some air brushed
t-shirts that say "class of '94 - still partyin'".  just tell your
girlfriends we are going to lake dillon to camp or something.
