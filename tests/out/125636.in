To All:
As a follow up to Mark's e-mail, I want to update you all on the position I
am taking with Coastal Merchant (formerly Engage Energy US LP) as well.  Per
the ISDA in place between ENA and Coastal Merchant, we have been margining
them to cover there current exposure.  We are currently holding cash in
addition to the unsecured credit line as stated in the ISDA.  Coastal does
not want to post cash but would rather increase the guaranty to cover the
Financial exposure.  At this time, I have told them we can not incur any
increases in their guaranty because they are still securing Engage Energy
Canada exposure through their physical guaranty.  Coastal has since notified
Engage Energy and Westcoast of this issue, and have requested that Engage
work with our legal groups to finalize the guaranty issues.
As I understand it from Mark's e-mail below, Engage is unwilling to work with
us to negotiate a satisfactory guaranty and physical contract.  I have made
Coastal aware that we can not increase these guaranty's until some resolution
has come about with Engage Canada, and we will continue to margin them for
cash as needed.
