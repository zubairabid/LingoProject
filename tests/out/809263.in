Phillips Production has/had two seperate PNG deals:
1.  500 MCFD; $2.82/MCF; 1/1/00 - 6/30/00
2.  300 MCFD;  $2.95/MCF;  1/1/00 - 11/30/00
To my knowledge, PNG does not send out production information to either the
producer or the pool operator.  This information should be available on
E-Script.
Phillips gets their production volumes (which they use to create our
invoice) from the company integrating the meter charts.  I beleive that this
is the same information provide to PNG.
