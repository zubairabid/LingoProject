Please be advised, we received a Letter of Credit covering physical power transactions between Edison Mission Marketing & Trading Inc. and EPMI.  This LC expires January 31, 2002.  Consequently, we have opened them up on EOL for East and West Physical Power trading for 2 (two) months only.  Once we get into November we will reduce their allowed trading term to 1 (one) month only.  This will effectively enable them trade out through the end of December 2001.  No trades should be done with this counterparty that extend beyond December 31, 2001 so that we can manage exposure within the term of the Letter of Credit provided.  Please call credit with any questions or comments.


Thanks
Wendy

PS- Tracy please forward onto all west traders.
