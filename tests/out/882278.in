Zou,

Hello, I hope you had a good flight back to Texas.  Thank you very much for your visit to the Denver location - I found it very informative.

I faxed over travel profiles to your office for the Enron North America, Denver employees.  I am now requesting the right to make travel using "ClickTrip" on behalf of the employees in our office:  Mark Whitt, Paul Lucci, Theresa Staab, and Tyrell Harrison.  Please set me, Heidi DuBose, up as their travel arranger.

Thank you again for the meeting,

Sincerely,
Heidi DuBose
