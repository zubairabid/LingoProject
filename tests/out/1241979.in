Below is a perliminary report that Citizens sent and their recommendation.  Please note Rob's message.
Gary will you and Tiny review the report and next week we can set a conference call to discuss what we
think that can be done if we choose to regulate our pressure to the Citizens site.  The call will include all
the above personnel.  After we have our call I would like to call Citizens and let them know if there is anything
TW can or is willing to do, or is it a Citizens design problem.
I will let everyone know the dial in number on Monday.  I will be on vacation tomorrow.

Thanks DS
