Phil,
I agree with your assessment, but would offer some additional information.;
After returning from Austin on Wednesday and learning that Larry Campbell
had;received a negative reaction from EPA Region IX concerning a possible
meeting with them, I worked on this issue most of Thursday and Friday.; The
strategy I discussed with Lou was to locate a local Arizona or California
"political/lawyer" type;who would have the necessary contacts to get us in
there and get the permits moving.; Lou agreed and we have been working on
that strategy while gathering more information related to the "right" contact
that could get this job done.; I personally have had lengthy discussions
(Thursday and Friday) with Lou, Larry Campbell, Bill Kendrick and several key
consultants that have extensive contacts within both Arizona and
California.;We are closing in on a;local law firm and also a "high level;air
consultant";who will be able to get us in at the Director or Air Permit Chief
level;to present (1) our;situation, (2) clean air needs for Arizona and CA,
and (3) how long these permits have already been on file.; We should have
someone identified early this next week.;
;
Let me present the following information to;complement yours:
* ;The permitting timeline;being used;was based on historical
timelines;encountered;while processing prior Arizona projects.; No indication
of backlogs or slower processing in the beginning.; A familiar consultant
(Argent);was used for the air permit applications and no indication was
offered by the AZ DEQ or EPA Region IX that normal processing was not
occurring.; Applications filed in March, 2001 and by letter from the agencies
were deemed complete by mid-April.
* Within the last two weeks, the Arizona DEQ Permit Engineer assigned to the
applications for Station 1 and 2 has stated that he is overloaded and working
on the applications as they are in the "que".; He told Larry Campbell (and I
have verified;it also by talking to outside consultants that permit in
Arizona) that this is true and the AZ DEQ have been very slow lately in
getting permits out. (Caveat: One of the suggestions we want to carry in to
AZ DEQ is that we would be willing to pay for a third-party contractor to
take the permits and work them up;for release to the publishing firm so they
can be sent out for public comment.; AZ DEQ is willing to meet with us and
discuss our applications.);; Even if we get this part going, this is only
part of the problem.; Bottom line is;we must play our cards;correctly at this
juncture to be able to get our applications moved up in the que, typed, and
out for public comment; but EPA Region IX will still have thirty days after
that for their review of those two state issued permits.
* EPA Region IX is a different story.; It is most difficult to put pressure
on them, more so than AZ DEQ.; The applications for Stations 3 and 4 are on
tribal land and these;applications are not delegated to any state air quality
department.;;After the technical meetings in the office last week, Larry made
a couple of calls;to the Permit Engineer;in Region IX and received a negative
response.; Larry was told that the;permits would issue in one to four months
and that;there was no need for a meeting with them.; Again,;my advice at this
point is to find the right person with the right contacts at a very high
level and get the meeting set.; It's one thing to pressure the State of
Arizona and get a permit applications moving; but if we are not very careful
with Region IX we could damage our ability to not only get Sun Devil's
permits, but create audits and compliance situations that are far reaching.;
Again, we must first get a personal meeting with them;to enable us to
present;the need, circumstances, and how long these permits have already been
on file.; Locating the;correct person to help us do that is of upmost
importance!
* Clarifying the complicated point, EPA Region IX has responsibility
to;review and publish not only the permits for Stations 3 and 4, but to also
review the AZ DEQ permits for stations 1 and;2 for 30 days.; Therefore, if we
anger EPA Region IX over permits for Stations;3 and 4, they could delay the
issuance of the permits for Stations 1 and 2 that;have been expedited with
the AZ DEQ.; It's a two-edged sword.
Our Strategy:
* Continue to work on the technical staff permit engineers, but very
carefully.; Indications are that our phone calls are beginning to annoy them.
* Locate a political/lawyer type that has connections at the top of AZ DEQ
and EPA Region IX to help us get the;desired meeting with key;people in order
to;move;the permits.; This should be done within the next week.
* Offer to assist in any manner (e.g., funding a third party) to get the
permit applications moving out of AZ DEQ and EPA Region IX for public comment.
I have some strategic ideas that will increase the;probability that this type
of circumstance will not occur in the future.; I will be glad to discuss any
of this with you on Monday morning.; John Shafer
