FERC Commissioner Breathitt certainly has a handle on the physical side.  I'm
also pleased that she's advocating
market tools as a means for California utilities to lower their gas costs,
including risk management and
[efficient use of] storage.  I'd like to see her carry the ball over the goal
line here by advocating comprehensive
regulatory restructuring to make full use of all of the tools available, not
only to the utility, but to its customers as well.



Breathitt wants more attention on Calif. gas
Although the energy spotlight has been on California,s electricity crisis,
the number of California
gas issues at FERC is continually increasing, signaling the need to focus on
the gas
side of the equation, a FERC commissioner said last week.
&[T]here is volatility in the gas markets as well as the electric markets,8
FERC Commissioner
Linda Breathitt said at the American Gas Association,s FERC Natural Gas
Regulatory
and Market Issues Seminar last week in Washington, D.C. And the cost of gas,
she said, is the
component that has the biggest influence on the cost of electric generation.
Two issues pending at FERC are whether to re-impose price caps on secondary
market
transactions and whether to cap prices on gas sales, Breathitt said.
In addition, FERC recently issued an order to help remove obstacles to
increased energy
supplies into the West (GD 3/15). In the order, FERC sought comments on the
need to provide
rate incentives for projects that would make additional capacity available by
this summer on
constrained pipeline systems. &I believe that if the commission does provide
incentives, we
should be very precise regarding the activity we are encouraging and the
incentives we will be
willing to consider, if at all,8 Breathitt said.
The commissioner also voiced concern over a California issue that sits at the
state level -
intrastate pipeline facilities. California, she said, needs to assess whether
its intrastate system is
adequate to take gas from the border to its market. &I am worried that where
there is insufficient
takeaway capacity, FERC,s actions to increase capacity to the border may
result in problems,
such as prorationing,8 Breathitt said.
Meanwhile, Breathitt suggested local distribution companies in California
need the ability
to use risk management tools. Policies should be in place to give gas buyers
an incentive to use
such tools, including price hedging and the efficient use of storage, she
said.
But regulators should be careful in noting the difference between hedging to
reduce exposure
to price volatility and what Breathitt called &mere speculating.8 While
hedging can be
used to decrease uncertainty, speculating to beat the market can actually
increase the possibility
of risk, she said.
Regulators in California and other states should look into the benefits of
reducing gas buyers,
dependence on the spot market. &A balanced portfolio of long- and short-term
contracts makes a
great deal of sense when spot prices are at the extreme levels of the past
year,8 she said.
