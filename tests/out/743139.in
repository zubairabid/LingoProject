Rick Simpson from the Speaker's office, said there will be no amendments to the bill prior to its passing the Assembly.  They are still scrambling for votes and sent the Chamber and WSPA lobbyists out to shore up a few while I was in the office.  I talked to Mike Kahl, WSPA lobbyist, whose firm also represents the restaurant assn.  He argued that the 24th was in the bill for awhile and he called all of their clients to tell them to sign up by the 24th.  He said Enron should have done the same.  I argued that Enron did the best it could, but that negotiations with many entities take varying amounts of time.  So long as the date is past, and customers still have to pay exit fees, what was the relevant policy debate.  There can't be a gold rush now.  Scott pointed out to me that bothWendy's and Burger King
probably belong to the restaurant assn., so our suggestion is that those entities contact Jot Condie at the assn to instruct his lobbyists to change the date to Sept. 1st.  This is time sensitive.  The Chamber lobbyist would love to see a Sept. 1 date, but was not optimistic that they could move the Governor's office.
Rick agreed to ask the Speaker to call Jeff Brown and ask for a delay until the Legislature has time to act.  He will say the bill is expected to pass his House tomorrow and changes will occur in the Senate which will give them direction.  Rick also expressed pessimism that Bowen's attempts at legislation will have a fruitful result.  I have been unable to speak to Burton directly about calling Brown, but hope to see him before the day is over.
Also I have a call in to Mayor Willie Brown, but so far I haven't heard back.
Jim, re the list of customers signing after July 1 - which ones would be affected by the Aug. 24th date?
