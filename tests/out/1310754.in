The purpose of this note is to update you on travel related to the recruiting efforts of the Program.
Over the weekend, President Bush asked all Americans to resume their activities, but to do so with the heightened awareness that the country is now at war with terrorists and with any country that supports their activities.  Enron's current position is that employees should avoid all non-essential business travel.  With these things in mind, and for the safety of our employees, I very strongly encourage you to consider alternatives to business travel for recruiting activities.
Earlier this year, we made the decision to emphasize real-time and direct recruiting methods, which by their design require less time and presence on campus.  I would now ask that each executive lead and recruiter carefully review their campus schedule / strategy and consider modifications.  Technology has given us the opportunity to use tools like video conferencing, telephone interviews, email, and CD based resume books.  The focusing benefits of these tools can significantly decrease the number of people required for on-campus presentations and interviews, and in some cases may even eliminate the need for these activities.  In addition to the primary concern of safety, a major disruption to the travel grid like that which occurred last week could strand critical Enron business personnel in relatively remote locations.
Later this week we will make a decision regarding participation in the National Black MBA Conference in Orlando, Florida.
