Hi Lucy/Natalie

Given that Manabu is perceived as the "Specialist" type, and probably
shouldn't go straight into the gas trading group, this may have implications
for Research headcount if he's considered a good non-A&A hire.

I'll be spending the next couple of weeks canvassing opinions from various
VPs and MDs over their preferred size, role and style of Research group for
Europe.  I think we should delay Manabu's second round interviews for a while.

Cheers,
Steve
