Please be advised that a manual adjustment will need to occur on ENA's contract 24924.  The deal was structured whereby TW would receive a marketing fee equal to 50% of the rate negotiated in excess of the original contracted rate between ENA and TW; the other 50% goes to ENA.

Here's the basics:
ENA's contract with TW is at a daily rate of $0.0600 (one-part)
The release to Burlington is at a daily rate of $0.1020 (demand only plus applicable commodity and fuel based on usage)
TW will bill Burlington through normal course of business (reservation of $71,400 [$0.1020 x 25,000 x 28days] plus applicable commodity fees)
ENA demand invoice will need to be adjusted so that they only receive a capacity release credit of $56,700 [($0.1020 - $0.0210) x 25,000 x 28 days] Amy -  please do an adjustment of the capacity release rate by inputting a discount of $0.0210 for this line item on the manual invoice.
Richard - When payment is received from Burlington for their acquisition, please process the credit amount of $14,700 to ENA.
TW will need to book marketing fee revenues of $14,700 [$0.0210 x 25,000 x 28 days]  Richard - Has a separate account been established for these revenues?

If you have any questions, please let me know.
