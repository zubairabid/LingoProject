Given the sheer amount of work necessary to complete the Disclosure
Schedules, how about if we revise our request for completion of drafts of the
Disclosure Schedules to be by the end of the day on Monday, as oppossed to
this Friday.  We will of course take the information early.

I have been informed by Cullen Duke as follows:   that the attached list of
entites has been compiled by Jan Johnson.  It is based on their Hyperion
system roll-up of companies for management reporting.  It does include some
companies that we will not want to transfer.  Accounting and tax are jointly
combing the list to identify such retained entities.  You may be able to help
Cullen on identifying such entities.

I will be calling the GCs soon to see about setting up a time to call local
counsels to confirm our thinking on being able to implement the A,B,C
structure in the various foreign jurisdictions.  As part of that "call"
relates to regulatory matters, Rick Shapiro and others will be involved, as
well as  Bill Weiland, from V&E.  We would like to set up these calls to go
through the structure and discuss the issues identified with the local
counsels very soon.  They will obviously need some time to reflect on the
various issues.

Again, all remains highly confidential.

Thanks for all the help.  Lance.
