Guys, I can't recall how the corporate opportunity is managed between Canada
and the US for these customers particularily with regard to their
transactions in Michigan et al.  Is Eastern Canada now managed by the Central
desk from a trading and mid-market point of view since Story came down to
Houston? How are the structured deals managed?  Is this still the right split
for the business?

Regards
Delainey
