I will distribute copies of the initial draft of QFD chart to you.  The goal
of the meeting is to clearly define the customers, collect all known and
expected customer requirements (their WANTS),  prioritize the WANTS,
brainstorm HOW we can or do meet the WANTS,  prioritize the HOWS, discuss how
to organize the findings, and then talk about unnecessary or low value work.
A customer is anyone we provide services, reports, analyses, data, or any
other product to.  The customer is the C in COPIS.

If you have any time between now and 13:00 hrs then please think of any
customer requirement (what they want from us) that you are aware of but is
not under the header "Customer Expectation".   Scribble it on your copy in an
open cell.   Other than that just bring your copy of the chart to the meeting
with you.   Thanks.
