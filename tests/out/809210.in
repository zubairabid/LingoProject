FYI!  Commonwealth Energy is going to add two new meter sets to their
existing CNG contract.  These meters will be at Bridgeport and are expected
to do about 15 dths a day.  The well names are James R. Kelly #1 and Russell
Marsh #1.  They are both located in Barbour County, WV.  The meter numbers
are not known at this time and they will be added with our 10/00 production
period.

Thanks,
Heidi
