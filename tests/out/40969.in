I just spoke with D. Cavanaugh and he indicated that Riverside has not pulled their Cal-ISO schedule for June 1. Rebecca Grace indicates that Riverside is current on cash payments due Enron. I recommend that we continue delivery until such time as Riverside refuses or they fail to make payment when due. It may make sense to hold off on hedging the July Riverside position (currently planned for next Thursday) to see if they follow through on their threat. In addition, we may want to consider a written response to the vague threats contained in their May 30, 2002 letter.

Harlan: your opinion?
