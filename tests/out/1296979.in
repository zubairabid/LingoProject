Stefan,
Sorry I didn't respond sooner; it's been really hectic around here.
The GTC looks fine; it's the standard GTC for ENA financial products.
The product descriptions generally look fine as well.  One question I have, however, is to what extent the attached product descriptions differ (apart from being denominated in USD rather JPY) from the WTI swaps currently being traded by ENA?
Also, the memo that Joe sent to Jeff states that:
"the products are part of Enron Japan's overall effort to extend Enron's crude and products business to Japan.  It will be marketed to customers as one potential means to meet their risk management requirements."
Pursuant to our previous discussions and e-mails, I understand that Enron Japan will not be involved with these products.  If this is not the case, we need to discuss what the facts are specifically going to be so as to avoid any tax issues for ENA or Enron Japan arising from any of their activities relating to this product (e.g., such as marketing).  Please confirm what the facts are going to be (as they currently stand).
