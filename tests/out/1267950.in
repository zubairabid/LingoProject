Earlier today, FERC issued the attached order approving an extension of the NYISO's Automated Mitigation Procedures (also known as the AMP or Circuit Breaker) through April 30, 2002, rather than until October 31 as had been sought by the ISO. Enron had submitted comments opposing the ISO's request. FERC also directs the ISO to file a comprehensive mitigation proposal that addresses FERC's concerns with the AMP as well as FERC's concerns regarding how the ISO's overall mitigation measures work together. This proposal is due by March 1, to be effective May 1.

FERC acknowledges two problems with the AMP that the NYISO has already committed to fix: limiting the mitigation to specific zones and hours that fail the impact test, and exempting bids of less than 50 MW unless thee is a demonstrated  market power concern. In addition, FERC directs the ISO to work with market participants to (1) examine whether the AMP may serve as a barrier to entry for new generation, and whether such new generation should be exempted from the AMP; (2) examine whether other energy limited resources, including those constrained by environmental rules, should be exempted from or accommodated in the AMP. Currently, only hydro units are exempted because their volatile bids often reflect their opportunity costs, not market power. FERC believes this logic applies to all energy limited resources as well; (3) file a comprehensive mitigation proposal which also explains how the AMP will work in conjunction with other mitigation measures already in effect or proposed, including the in-city mitigation  measures. FERC is concerned here that that all the pieces may not fit together and there may be inconsistencies and gaps; and (4) consider must-run  mitigation measures consistent with ISO-NE and PJM. Again, FERC seems to be concerned here with transmission constraints within NYC. (Note that the Con Ed distribution system is not secured by the ISO and this has been at the root of most of the out-of-merit calls in the City.)  Finally, FERC cautions the NYISO that it expects one mitigation plan for the Northeast as part of the RTO process, and it encourages them to collaborate with PJM and ISO-NE in formulating its March 1 comprehensive mitigation plan.
