Daylight For Gray Davis

SACRAMENTO -- The lights are dimmed in the office of California Gov. Gray Davis, but his prospects of winning reelection next year and becoming a 2004 Democratic presidential possibility are looking a lot brighter than they were just a few months ago.

The office air-conditioning is imperceptible, despite the outside temperature of 105 degrees, as Davis practices the energy conservation he has been preaching. But overall, the summer has been mild, electric power usage is down 12 percent from last year and there hasn't been a blackout anywhere in the state since May 8.

Republicans, who had set up a Web site to record the expected energy crisis, concede that Davis has dodged a disaster. Always cautious, the governor says, "So far, so good, but you never talk about a possible no-hitter in the middle of the game."

In fact, Davis is not home free. He is pushing a financial bailout bill to avert bankruptcy for Southern California Edison, a bill opposed by both free-market Republicans and liberal Democrats in the legislature. Sale of bonds to replace the billions the state spent buying power last winter and spring has been held up by litigation from already bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric, leaving a potential hole in the current-year budget and ensuring that the election-year fiscal situation likely will be grim. Drought conditions threaten a water shortage next year.

Private polls show clear vulnerabilities for Davis. Despite a drop in public fears of an energy crisis and some increasing optimism about the overall direction of the state, two August surveys I was shown found fewer than one-third of Californians favor reelecting Davis, while two-thirds say he should definitely be replaced or they would consider an alternative. His job approval scores are as poor as those of President Bush, who lost California in a landslide last November.

The polls show a notable Davis weakness among Democrats, and one veteran lobbyist here told me that the governor was "just one blackout away from drawing a serious primary opponent" -- one reason that Davis last week preemptively staged a show of support from the Democratic mayors of seven big cities.

But the potential vulnerability may never be tested. Davis has $30 million in the bank and is headed for a $50 million war chest. California has not denied a sitting governor a second term since 1942, reelecting two Democrats and four Republicans, most recently Pete Wilson, who was in much worse shape politically in 1993 than Davis is now.

And all three potential Republican gubernatorial candidates have liabilities. Wealthy businessman William Simon Jr., son of the former Treasury secretary, has impressed Republican insiders as personable and smart. But he has never run for office before and is unknown to the voters, who have showed skepticism about first-time millionaire candidates in both parties.

Secretary of State Bill Jones, the only Republican in statewide office, has been Davis's most aggressive and effective critic, zeroing in on conflicts of interest in the stock holdings of several Davis energy advisers and appointees. But Jones left the Bush campaign early in the battle for the 2000 nomination to endorse Sen. John McCain, and the White House reportedly has told GOP contributors not to help him. Two McCain allies, Sens. Fred Thompson and Chuck Hagel, are coming out to raise money for Jones next month, but his treasury is anemic.

The White House favorite is former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, who won two races in that heavily Democratic city. Riordan is 71 and, as Davis points out, has never run statewide or in a partisan contest. Conservatives question his liberal social policy positions, and Jones notes pointedly, "Riordan and his wife have contributed more than $1.5 million against Republican candidates, including $80,000 to Gray Davis in past races."

With its growing population of minorities, California looks even to business lobbyists more and more like a solidly Democratic state, where Republican victories will be the exception. GOP leaders in the legislature and the congressional delegation appeared last week to be ready to accept redistricting plans that would save their current seats but lock them into minority status for the next decade.

Bush, who was once seen by California GOP leaders as their salvation, now seems to some of them to have turned his back on the state. He has visited only once since taking office, and one GOP official told me, "The only Cabinet member we ever see out here is [former Californian] Ann Veneman," the secretary of agriculture.

It is a complete reversal of fortune for the home base of Earl Warren, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and Gray Davis is the lucky beneficiary of this historic shift.
