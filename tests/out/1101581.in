It is my understanding that agreements are imminent to begin the process of returning EES's residential customers in California to bundled service under their respective utilities.  This will reduce load in all congestion zones -- roughly by an average 10 MW in the south and 10 MW in the north.  This cumulative load reduction will be phased in over the course of a full billing month as customer meters are read in their normal cycles.  For now the timing is uncertain but I assume load reductions could begin as soon as mid-June.  These developments will be reflected in future forecast schedules.  Details will be sent you as soon as they are available.
