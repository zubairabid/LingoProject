Rebecca, Craig - I talked to Mr. Shurkis from the PA PUC and he asked that we update these license-related forms.  I told him we plan on preserving the contracts in their current form at least up through completion of the acquisition (and hopefully beyond with a name change).  Also, note the reference to the Clinton license.  Gloria is available to help with the submission and the Clinton request but let us know what you'd like us to do.
