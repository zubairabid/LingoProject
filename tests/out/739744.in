Hey guys,
I've updated the transmission rates table for May - here is the location:
M:\Electric\East Volume Mgmt\Transmission\Transmission Rates
If there is a better spot for this to make it more accessible just let me
know and I can put a copy of it whereever.
Couple of other trends I've noticed that hopefully can be corrected...
First Energy transmission is now and has been for a while under the
counterparty American Transmission Systems, Inc. (ATSI)
Duke transmission should be under the Duke counterparty Duke Electric
Transmission (DUKEELETRA)
Georgia's ancillary service charges have changed although their website has
not be updated - price changed from $2.57 to $2.49
Please pass this along to the rest of the group, if any of you have any
questions or suggestions - don't hesitate to call.
Thanks,
Michael
