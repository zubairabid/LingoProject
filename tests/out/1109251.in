Will the madness never end?   We go through this on every claim.  I don't know why our insurance guys cannot get on Enron's side to get as much paid for as possible.  Let there be no mistake--Enron Risk Management has a long held disdain for lawyers gettin involved to examine their policies.  I don't doubt for a minute Stuart was preconditioed on this one.  Eddy & I are meeting with Jim Bouillion today and we'll see what we can do.  I agree with Eddy that if they pay the big stuff, we need to be careful. I'm pissed but don't worry--I'll be charming and nice as long as I have to be.  There are definitely a list of things that should be covered, although I agree examination of the policy for coverage probably is not.  But Gordon and Jack's work on that was limited and most of their advice has been related to the Siemens issues, mitigation of damages, conduct as the prudent uninsured, and questions as to how to address these issues under Brazilian law which governs the policy.  The correspondence, the POs, agreements etc should be covered.
