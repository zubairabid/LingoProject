We prepared a presentaton on Argentina and Brazil for your SP trip.  Michael Guerriero said that we should add you to our e-mail list.  John Lavorato and Jim Hughes have already been added.  I am the Director of the Sovereign Risk and Foreign Exchange Group within Enron Research under Vince Kaminski.

A few weeks ago Gary Hickerson asked me to send information to Kevin Hannon on Argentina, Brazil, India. Korea, Turkey and the UK.  We've sent excerpts from past Global Markets Monitors (GMM) published by Maureen Raymond Castaneda and Gwyn Koepke from Enron Research Department.  I thought it would be helpful to add you to the list of recepients of this weekly publication.

Please find attached the two most recent issues of the GMM.   The purpose of this product is to inform the traders as well as various business units across the corporation on important international economic events and their impact on currency and financial markets.  Special emphasis is placed on potential central bank policy changes and the impact these changes have on interest rates and currencies.  We also emphasize emerging markets countries such as Argentina, Brazil, India, Korea, and Turkey.  We select countries that have relevant news, a credit rating change or are in the midst of an economic or financial crisis.

Past issues can be located on our website address http://enaresearch.corp.enron.com/research/framework/default.asp
We also attached for your convience previous GMM articles from Jan. 2000-Aug. 10, 2001 for Brazil and Argentina.  Also attched is an internally distributed e-mail outlining the risks of default and devaluation in Argentina.  And finally the assumptions behind the Brazil curve.

If you have any question regarding Argentina or Brazil or any other countries in which Enron has assets, our group can help.  I can be reached at X3-0396 in Houston.

Maureen Raymond-Castaneda
