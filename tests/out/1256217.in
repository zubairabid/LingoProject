IntercontinentalExchange Named Derivatives Exchange of the Year

Atlanta, GA (January 23, 2002) - IntercontinentalExchange, one of the world's most liquid and fastest growing commodity marketplaces, has been named Derivatives Exchange of the Year for 2002 by Risk magazine. The Risk Awards recognize excellence and innovation in the fast-changing risk management and over-the-counter derivatives businesses. Intercontinental was selected for its phenomenal performance in 2001 in light of the difficult year experienced by many trading platforms in the global energy sector.

"The Intercontinental organization has experienced a tremendous year," said Jeff Sprecher, CEO of IntercontinentalExchange, who was also recently named as one of the Top Entrepreneurs of 2001 by Businessweek magazine. "To be named Derivatives Exchange of the Year is a testament to the extremely talented group surrounding me at Intercontinental, who are successfully advancing a very powerful business model."

Intercontinental experienced tremendous growth and reached numerous milestones in 2001. With the acquisition of International Petroleum Exchange of London (IPE), Europe's leading energy futures and options exchange, ICE added a broad range of exchange-traded energy-based futures and options markets to its extensive roster of energy and metals-based over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.

In August 2001, Intercontinental signed an agreement to offer optional clearing services to its OTC market participants with The London Clearing House (LCH). With this service, Intercontinental will be uniquely positioned to offer market participants the option to utilize clearing services for global energy and metals transactions.

Coupled with the July 2001 closing of its acquisition of the IPE, Intercontinental will
be the world's first exchange organization to offer a full spectrum of risk management products ranging from traditional bi-lateral OTC agreements to cleared OTC products to exchange-traded futures and options on futures.

The past year also saw Intercontinental make its move into the European OTC gas and power markets with the introduction of markets for UK natural gas-related products in December 2001. To support this expansion, ICE entered into agreements
with a number of leading firms engaged in the sale and trading of UK natural gas.

In addition to expanding its product offerings in 2001, Intercontinental experienced
rapid and substantial growth. The past year saw Intercontinental increase the number of participating firms and users by more than 400%. Equally impressive, the number of trades executed on the Exchange grew 15 fold over that same period.

Intercontinental will receive the award at the Risk Awards Presentation Dinner on
February 28th in New York. The proceeds of the dinner will go to Risk Waters Group World Trade Appeal Fund.
