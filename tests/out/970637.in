Hi Vince

James New from London Risk Mgt has asked me to sign off the computations in
EnergyDesk.com for use in Oslo office's new system.  I'm a little
uncomfortable with this since:
1. Sign off of models is something that I've been brought up to consider to
be the domain of RAC.  They disagree in part (see below), which leads me to...
2. London Research is not the "owner" of Exotica, and we don't necessarily
have the time/resource/expertise to audit Houston Research's code.  Indeed,
can Research group sign off their own efforts?  By definition the originating
group for a piece of code thinks it's OK, or they wouldn't have written it
that way.
3. I'm concerned about Research group code being sold to external clients
without Research involvement.  (I received a query a couple of weeks ago from
an EnergyDesk.com guy, Jan Lillehammer, who said he was planning to sell our
VaR system, and asked if he could have a copy!)

I've tried to emphasise that we support Exotica for internal purposes only,
and that our entire setup presupposes the presence of resident quants on the
trading floor to support the tools that Research write.

Your advice/guidance would be appreciated.

All the best,
Steve
