Per discussion with David, Theresa and myself this morning, we have agreed
that the current most effective approach is for Trena/Jeff K. to do the
executions for London Credit.com and for Equity/Debt Trading to do the
settlements.
The trades will be executed in the name of London Credit.com.  We need to set
up a Morgan Stanley account in the name of London Credit.com to facilitate
settlements.
We contacted Ketan Parekh, Morgan Stanley, VP, Prime Brokerage, to discuss
the impact of housing the account in NY vs. Morgan Stanley London.  Ketan
said that they have many clients that are settling activity from Europe in
their NY prime brokerage accounts with no problems.  Since the NY and London
would be different settlement streams and in light of the current anticipated
activity, we are requesting we open an account in Morgan Stanley NY.
Sara, David suggested that Paul Simons would be the contact for account
opening information.
