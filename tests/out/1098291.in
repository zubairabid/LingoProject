Hi Scott,


How are you?  Thanks for your email.

I can appreciate your concerns about the public firm models, but am at a loss for what more I can say that has not already been said.

Recall that during my recent trip to London, we had a conference call with Houston research, you, Bryan, Mike and Eric.  During this conference call Vince, Vasant, Amitava and I pointed out some of the "issues" with the public firm models and the data used to develop these models.

In addition, after that conference call you, Bryan, Mike, Eric and I had further discussions as to how to sort out the public firm models.  During this discussion we all agreed that most of these issues had already been raised and addressed by George Albanis in the following documents:
1.  EnronCredit.com Project Proposal - Movement Model and Parallel Work - Phases IV,  by George Albanis, December 2000
2.  Meeting 25/01/2001 - Review, by George Albanis.

I also forwarded copies of these documents to you and Ben via email on May 11th.  Just in case you can't find them, I will forward them again.

Based on recent discussions with Jeff Kinneman, it is my understanding that he will be meeting with Vince and Bryan to figure out how to "repair" the public firm models.  Hence it may be more appropriate to direct any future concerns about the public firm models to their attention.




Regards,
Iris
