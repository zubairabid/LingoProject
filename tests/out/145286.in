I spoke with Kent Harris at Wildhorse today and he stated there position to
me on a few things.
1.  Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual
reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity.  He said that the San Arroyo
#2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries
to NWPL.  They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some
capacity into NWPL.
2.  Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that
"the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other
systems other than the Mesa system".  In addition he stated that we do not
have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to.
3.  He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current
situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out".  I reiterated
that we have been waiting for them to either acknowledge that they will
gather the entrada gas under the current contract or provide us with another
alternative.  Absent either of those 2 things happening all we can do is try
to live by the existing agreement.  He stated that they have new estimates on
the cost to construct a new line through the South Canyon and it is
approximately $1MM less than their original esitmate.
We left it that he would determine whether or not they would gather  the
Entrada under the existing contract or make a new proposal that would most
likely wrap the Entrada and Dakota up under one new deal and replace the
existing contract.
I told him we would determine whether or not we wanted to "let the lawyers
fight over the existing contract" or work on a new deal for all the
production.
P.S.  They are still very interested in some type of Joint Venture.
