Based upon valving constraints and the innaccessability to the inside of the
pipe between our M/S and the Topock C/S, a decision has been made to postpone
cleaning of his section of the pipeline.  should cleaning occur of this
section, it is anticipated that it will not occur untill the installation of
the filter separator at the PG&E C/S, sometime later this year.  Vector has
been notified of this change in plans and will adjust their cleaning
schedule  accordingly.
