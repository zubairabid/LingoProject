Tatiana -

After researching these three deals, we've found that our group does not have access to reliable third-party documentation to support their occurrence. Because there are no Real Time confirmation letters, and no NERC Tags were done for hourly deals at the beginning of this year, it falls to cash invoices to support the validity of Real Time deals. I've spoken with Stacey White, in Houston's Risk group, and she explained to me that there are documents our Settlements group can access that may provide the information you need.

I'm sorry to keep sending you from group to group, but I'll be more than happy to help you get ahold of people who can provide you with relevant deal documentation.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
