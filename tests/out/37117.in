Here are the credit and VAR lists for today.  I have written notes in the VAR list (the attached spreadsheet) on a book by book basis indicating what I think the status of each book is (ie whether the book will be officialized going fwd).  There are still some questions I have concerning certain books.

Can each of you review this list and confirm that I have the correct status?  Also, I need to talk to Scott Mills, Michelle Bruce, Kristin Albrecht, Jenny Latham, and Didrik Thrane-Nielsen specifically as I need to obtain a complete understanding of what their risk groups are doing.

Credit and Market risk - I'll keep you updated with changes in the status of the books.  Right now, I know we will have to rerun VAR either later this morning or early this pm.  I expect CAS will have to be rerun too.



Best regards,

Shona
