I have been requested by Javier Chavarria to start direct conversations with Humberto to supply him for the needs of Progasco / Tropigas.  In order to cover our costs and make the sale to Humberto, we need a landed cost around MB + 5 for 55,000 Mts per year delivered in partial cargoes sizes that can vary anywhere from 3,000 Mts to 15,000 Mts but cargoes over 8,000 Mts have to be carefully co-ordinated due to the fact that EcoElctrica keeps an inventory in their tanks.

Suzanne, I need to move aggressively to try and make this deal .
