1)  Is this deal done?  No, not yet.  Cabot is reviewing our new Enfolio long
term contract and has suggested some minor modifications.  Also, this new
long term contract form is awaiting final Legal Department approval - we
expect this imminently.  Finally, our reservoir engineers are scheduled to
visit Cabot's offices on 12/5/2000 to review their downhole data - we will
not enter into a long term contract until a full reserve review has been
completed.
2)  What is the firm quantity?   The quantitiy should be fixed.  For
December, the firm quantity on Tennessee is 11,280 Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the
14,100 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  The firm quantity on Transco is 14,720
Mmbtu/d, or 80% of the 18,400 Mmbtu/d we expect to flow.  We intend to keep
the desk whole on these firm quantities.
3)  Who is communcating with Cabot from a logisitics/volume management point
of view?  We expect to communicate with Cabot from a logistics/volume
management point of view.
4)  Why are we nominating ( instead of ENA Upstream) and which group is
responsible for balancing on Tenn and Transco?  We intend to do whatever is
necessary to get the gas to pipeline pooling points and thereupon turn it
over to each Desk's logistics team.  We do not see the need to duplicate our
existing logistics function.
