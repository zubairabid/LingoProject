There are a few other issues we need to look into:
Larcamp told Hartsoe and I after the meeting that FERC may clarify that the
price caps and reporting obligations apply only to bids into the PX and ISO
-- ie no bilateral transaction will be subject to the requirements.  He asked
if knowing this would change any of our views (esp peaking plants, though I
suspect it's already too late for that).  My gut reaction is that so long as
the market continues to clear through the centralized exchanges this
"exemption" for bilateral transactions won't matter much, but let's think it
through.  Is EOL or APX an alternative?
Massey specifically asked us to address forward markets in our comments.
Specifically, "has FERC done everything it can to encourage forward market
development?"  In addition to any other points we might make, I think we
should argue that "PJMing" the market won't facilitate and may even hinder
forward market development.  Also, we should advocate actions by FERC that
take away second-guessing by the CPUC in order to reduce utility fears about
contracting forward.
We have to give the Commission a way out on price caps.  We need to think
through whether there is something we can live with here, or we should take
the approach I took in my testimony:  FERC should encourage the state to
provide rate protection for selected customer classes by putting those
requirements up for bid (ie get the utility out of the commodity business as
much as possible).
Finally, on governence issues we should argue for a narrowe role for the ISO
as a way of diffusing the emotional governence debate.  Analogy:  if the ISO
is simply the air traffic controller all parties will simply be interested in
retaining the most technically competent people (not hiring or appointing
their lackies or friends).  So long as the ISO has a role in setting prices,
acquiring supplies or running the market, it is destined to be controversial
and highly politicized.  Those functions should be left to the market.
