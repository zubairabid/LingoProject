Each issue of IntelliBytes is a concise summary of a broadband industry
topic.  April's issue is titled "Broadband 2001 according to JP Morgan and
McKinsey".  It contains information on operating and capital expenditures
involved in deploying xDSL and cable modems, the changing mix of Internet
traffic, and projection of U.S. CDN revenues to the consumer and business
market.



For those on the EBS LAN, you may view historic issues of IntelliBytes by
choosing "Browse the Spotlight" from wEBSource. The Spotlight symbol will
appear, from the circle titled "Business Development" choose "Market Research
& Intelligence", then choose "IntelliBytes".   A listing of the available
issues will appear.   To view February's issue on Interactive TV and/or
March's issue on Cable vs DBS in their proper format, select "Fetch" under
the Functions  tab.

Historic issues of IntelliBytes will soon be available via the Market
Intelligence community page of wEBSource.

For those on the Corp LAN, I have attached the February and March issues of
