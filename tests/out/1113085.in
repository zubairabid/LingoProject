Hi Susan:

Thanks for the update.  I haven't seen the fax yet, but I'll track it down.

There is no doubt that this will be a long process.  In fact the final determinations by the US on countervailing (CVD) and anti-dumping (AD) are not expected until December at the earliest and February at the latest.  Then the NAFTA & WTO dispute processes take years to resolve.  In the meantime, the ruling for a 19.31% duty is having immediate impact on Canadian lumber mills.  Which is why I'm a little surprised by lack of political movement.

The AD/CVD process is usually very effective in protecting US business so it's understandable that the Bush Administration would let the process work.  Besides he has already contradicted his free trade approach on steel matters.  But this issue is slightly different.  This is a case against one country, Canada, which is our largest trading partner. Retaliation from Canada could be painful for the US - Canadian comments have threatened to restrict access to energy by the US (natural gas, hydro), so there is incentive to resolve the lumber issue amicably.  Perhaps both sides are posturing to win political points.  Perhaps this is a case to be carried out through international forums to rein in the use of AD/CVD (US is a champion at AD/CVD cases).

For now, lumber prices on Canadian lumber are up ~20% and US lumber has increased just below their Canadian competitors.  As well, Canadian supply is declining due to temporary mill closures.  I'll monitor the WGA site for updates, but if you hear any grumblings I'd appreciate a heads up.

Thanks again. Oh hey, I received the fax.

Regards,
Maggy Huson
