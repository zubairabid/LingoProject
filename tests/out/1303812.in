We, Vol Mgmt and Settlements are still trying to get the Nicor/Northerin Illinois Gas deals cleared through Unify.  Kam had tried to help Kathy Kelly and I last year with putting in storage tickets for the deals that address the Balancing/Wheeling/ and Loan volumes that ENA is charged by the Hub every month.  These volumes are coming through the Supply verifications and Sales invoices but are not being paid, nor being sent out and therefore creating issues for Settlements.   I remember that Sylvia Campos had stated that those tickets were not possible to put in because Nicor is an Hub not a storage facility.  My Nicor rep. faxed me copies of their tariff effective July15, 1999 stating they have the capacity for storage and transportation, so I'm a little confused what the problem is that is preventing us setting Nicor up correctly in global and Unify to handle these types of storage deals individually.

Any assistance with this would be greatly appreciated as we are showing a $4 million receivable outstanding for settlements and a $1.1 million payable on the service side and need to get these cleared as soon as possible.  I can make a copy of the tariff that I have just let me know.

Thanks,
Marlo James
