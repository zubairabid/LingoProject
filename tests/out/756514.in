All,


If you are receiving this email, then you have been selected as a review for one of my employees. My goal is to have a high level of excellence for IT support and I am unable to attain that for you the customer without your feedback. Your feedback on their performance is key for the PRC process as well has ensuring that you have the best support for your business possible.

The PEP system closes for feedback on May 25. If you do not intend to complete the feedback forms for my employees, please click on the decline button today so I can submit for another reviewer in your place.


Regards,

Dan Dietrich
