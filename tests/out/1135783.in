In the spirit of the holiday season, SDG&E has come over from the dark side and now supports the assignability of direct access contracts!  The utility also supports the ability of existing direct access customers to indefinitely remain on direct access after their contracts expire with one ESP, permitting them either to renew with their existing supplier or sign a new contract with another ESP.  In the attached filing, the utility argues that this is reasonable and fair to direct access customers, particularly in view of the Enron bankruptcy.  This will be an excellent development to reference in the comments that are due on January 4th in the DA suspension proceeding.

Happy Holidays to each of you and your families!
