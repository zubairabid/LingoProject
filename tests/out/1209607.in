Hello Mark, David, Matt, Jane and Angeline,
I have provided the additional questionnaire which we sent to our European
counsel with respect to trading in Bandwidth capacity. You may wish to
provide this to your counsel as a basis for the questionnaire regarding the
physical trading of Bandwidth capacity. Please note that one of the key
issues may be the location of the respective geographical points for each
Bandwidth transaction. We would anticipate that there would be fewer issues
or none at all where a particular counterparty wishes to trade in Bandwidth
capacity where the two respective geographical points are not located in
their jurisdiction. (ie. A German counterparty trading Bandwidth from
Brussels to Paris)
If you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact me at
0207 783 4084.
Kind Regards,
