I suspect that the SCE Hydro proceeding should take a turn similar to PG&E's
hydro.  Can you stay on top of it?  We estimate that Californian's would be
better off if the rate freeze is maintained and a future value of the
retained assets is assessed in order to avoid rate shock and maintain an
orderly transition to the end of the freeze.  For instance, we see the assets
being worth the following on December 31, 2001:

Mohave & Four Corners $2.7 billion
SCE Hydro  $1.6 billion
Palo Verde  $1.2 billion
SONGS  $2.8 billion
PG&E Hydro  $4.6 billion
Diablo Canyon  $4.0 billion
------------------
$16.9 billion

You see this is over $16.9 billion in assets on December 31, 2001.  If these
assets were valued as of January 1, 2001, these assets would be worth well
over $21 billion due to the current high market prices.  The $4 billion
difference is due to the difference in net revenues these assets are expected
to recover in 2001.

The current issue for the utilities and California is not a balance sheet and
undercollection issue, but rather a cash flow and supply issue.  We need to
make sure that the CPUC and State Legislature understand the difference.  The
cash flow issue can be solved by signals that the utilities will not be stuck
with the entire shortfall so that the investment community will lend the
utilities money or a loan from the State's budget surplus.  The supply issues
is a tougher issue, but can be mitigated largely from a temporary lifting of
Nox emission limits due to state emergencies, along with other potential
solutions.  The utilities are trying to end the rate freeze and using the
cash flow issue as the reason; but there real reason is to get 100% CTC
recovery, shift 100% risk to consumers, and get the windfall profits from
this market for their retained generation, while putting customers in an
unstable market.  The best rate stabilization plan is to keep the rate freeze
in place, let the market mobilize to (a) build power plants, (b) resolve
default service, (c) allow large customers an opportunity to shop, and (d)
get DSM projects underway for 2002 and beyond, reconcile the balance sheet by
the end of 2001, re-evaluate the nuclear settlements to avoid windfall
profits to utilities and rate shock to customers, and determine the
additional recovery of shortfalls on a going forward basis over some extended
period of time.

The last thing the State of California should do is to introduce the
instability of the market to customers, driving away business and
accelerating the State into a recession that will be difficult to recover
from for many years.  As I previously mentioned, the State will still need to
address the issue of cash flows and supply, and will have to make some
accomodations in order to avoid problems in California.

P.S.  I read in the paper the CPUC President Lynch stated at the Decision
Conference that it would be premature to end the rate freeze right now.  Is
this true?  Do you think they understand it is more of a cash flow issue
versus a balance sheet issue.
