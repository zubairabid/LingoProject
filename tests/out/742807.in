I don't have anything to add to John, there was no mention if ESC, OASIS II, seams issues, etc. at the Stakeholder Committee meeting on Monday.

I am cc: Jose and Richard to jog their memories.  If you guys recall anything about the discussion, please let Mark and I know.

I do however, want to tell you about the conversation I just had with Dave Nevius.  He called me to check the Enron concerns about the ESC resolutions as expressed by Andy Rodriquez' email.

Dave reverted to the fact that the sector voting model was language added at the request of John Anderson and Vann Prater.  I explained to him that those words were needed as an add on to salvage what we could.  If NERC was going to adopt the resolutions 7-9 concerning the ESC, John's concern (and I agree with him) was that the ESC structure doesn't work.  I think you agree as well given the response to the joint TCCG request to Gent last year re: membership on the ESC.  The intent of the additional language was to make the best of a bad situation.  If the ESC was going to be roped into NERC, it should at least adopt the new voting structure.

This may be useful info. for you.
