Filing of H.Q. Energy Services (U.S.), Inc.'s Supplemental Protest and Motion
to Lodge.  HQUS made this filing to lodge with the FERC  correspondence with
Northeast Power Coordinating Council that, in their opinion, clearly permits
a control area to meet its operating reserve requirements through external
transactions.  At issue  in the case is whether NEPOOL's refusal to use
resources external to New England to supply reserve is required by NERC or
NPCC rules.
