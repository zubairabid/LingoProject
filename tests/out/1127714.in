Pat,
I mentioned to Jan that I would provide ETS (and other BUs) with specific Adaytum project expense coding which has been used for previous training classes. She said it didn't matter to her if the business units coded their additional training classes to its own expense account, without charging the costs directly to the expense work order which Project Sunrise set up. Therefore, you do not need to transfer the costs which you have already coded to expense on ETS' books.
Thanks !
