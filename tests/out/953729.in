I have two things biting me.

First is time.  I need to turn a draft for Hannon and Rice ASAP.  So,  the
value of a deliberative approach to coming up with a V@R policy will quickly
evaporate if we take 2 weeks to study what the policy should say.

Second,  I have a unique situation.  Our concept of V@R is really unlike the
rest of Enron's today.  What happens today is that network engineers
unilaterally make decisions about deployment, configuration and other matters
which effect the longs and shorts of our asset/contract portfolio that they
view strictly from a network operating standpoint.

A good example was a decision to move our primary TeraPop (three large
servers storing 165 gigabytes each) from Portland to LA.  The servers are
already in place and purchased,  so no capital was involved.  But the
decision has huge ramifications on the future LA/New York and other Bandwidth
usage, and that cost money.  Now it could be that the LA/New York cost is
cheaper than the Portland/New York cost,  the whole point is no one knows.
What our "value-at-risk" policy attempt to corral is these types of decisions
and put them into the hands of the risk management group,  where the decision
will be made with at least some economic work behind it.

I really see the EBS V@R policy to be misnamed,  since we don't really have
the math done to calc V@R.  It really is a volumetric-based control policy
that says you can't make network changes over XX amount of Megabytes (a
storage measure)  or OC-3 equivalents (a bandwidth measure) without Risk
Management making or approving the decision.  I do believe that with
Research's help,  we can in time actually calculate the V@R impact of such
decisions.  At that time,  the policy should be modified to set metrics based
on the V@R calculations.

So if you have an open enough mind to let us co-op your word for a minute,
we need to start turning the minds of the network industry people into
thinking about their decisions as having value effects.  Said directly,
Kevin Hannon has given me authority to write a policy to move control over
significant network changes from the field to the trading floor,  and I am
going to issue something NOW to effectuate that......

So... I really want your views on what we are doing,  but thought you needed
some flavor and an sense of the urgency.  If you can weigh in,  do so
quickly.....
