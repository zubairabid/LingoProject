PROPOSED ACTION STEPS AGREED TO AT DENVER EMERGENCY MEETING ON DECEMBER 20,
2000

1. Action in California. The governors call upon California to redouble its
efforts to conserve electricity and to stabilize prices and its electric
power market.

2. FERC Investigation. The governors thank Chairman Hoecker for his offer of
assistance and ask that his staff prepare an immediate report on the
implications and potential consequences of regional price caps and bilateral
contracts, and to investigate: why Western electricity prices have been so
high; who
has benefitted from these high prices; and whether generating capacity has
been held back. This information will be useful whatever the individual
governors
views on these matters.

3. Energy Conservation. The governors commit to and ask their western
gubernatorial colleagues to join them in implementing a coordinated,
state-by-state,
voluntary conservation strategy to free up electricity in the West starting
no later than January 1. This plan would encourage consumers at every scale
to reduce
or reschedule electricity demand and would encourage state public service
commissions to review and adopt other steps such as mechanisms to pay users
for
forgoing power during times of high demand. Furthermore, the governors agree
and ask their western gubernatorial colleagues to join them in reducing the
electricity consumed by public agencies in their states. The states will
coordinate an energy conservation response by December 28.

4. Presidential Task Force. The governors call upon their colleague
President-elect Bush to convene a formal team to work with the western
governors on
this urgent issue while waiting for appointments to be made.

5. Increasing Supply. The governors will convene in late January or early
February a meeting of all the affected parties to prepare a vision and action
plan for
the west's energy future and its relation to a national energy policy,
including increasing the supply and availability of electricity and energy
throughout the region
today and in the future. The governors called for this meeting at the winter
2000 meeting of the Western Governors' Association; due to the current energy
crisis they have fast-tracked this meeting and the development of a
hemispheric energy policy.
