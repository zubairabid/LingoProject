I don't have any letters that the producers have sent to Dominion, but I do have copies of  termination letters and release letters they sent to us.  I can fax you some samples - what is your fax number?
At Dominion, I talked to Dan Baney, who knew only that they were requiring releases per their legal department.
Dennis Bond is a more knowledgeable person at Dominion at 304-627-3566.
Their attorney handling this matter is Bill Savier at 304-627-3340.
