Jeff -

As we discussed today, the following is the TRV (Trader Report Viewer)
project status:

TRV is targeted to be implemented by May 15th as scheduled.
TRV development and security setup has been completed and is ready to be
presented to the traders.
Hal and I will meet with Phillip and Kam tomorrow to provide the TRV
system and administrator rights review, and to publish  their region's
reports.
We will then meet with Darron, David, and Errol (to be scheduled for early
next week) to provide the TRV system and  administrator rights review, and to
publish their region's reports.
At the conclusion of the review, we will determine we will roll out the
training for the remaining team members within each  region (i.e. Region
Leads or IT to provide training to the team members).
Currently TRV is running in the development environment for the review
period.  Upon conclusion of the review period, we will  ask for approval and
UAT signoff from you in order to transition the system into the Production
environment.

Again, thank you and each of your team members for everyone's help and
support on this initiative!  Please let me know if you have any questions.
