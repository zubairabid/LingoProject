Doug,
No, its not unclear.  You are misinterpreting the instructions I was passing along to ENSR.  As a basic premise of dealing with consultants, one has to understand that they will spend time doing whatever you ask them to do (i.e., prepare a budget for tasks from beginning to an FERC filing or prepare a budget for tasks to take us from beginning to post construction).  Either way, you have to pay for what you ask them to do.  Therefore, you keep the marching orders as simple as possible, taking the process in steps.  In this way you eliminate superfluous tasks that are not essential at the moment.   Sometimes these projects start out like "gangbusters," but for commercial reasons or some other reason, they go away and you could be left paying for a task that basically has no added value.  I have found it best not to go that route.
In this instant case, I had broken down my instructions to ENSR so as to minimize their expenditures and even though from your perspective "ETS has been responsible for preparing a Level B estimate for Sun Devil since day one", the consultant need only know and respond to the task at hand - which is the way I have handled it.  That is why I worded my note the way I did.  It is not a "new" request, but a continuation of one that he has already started.   By working it this way, you only pay for what you need and for what you get - not for an all encompassing budget that may never materialize.
