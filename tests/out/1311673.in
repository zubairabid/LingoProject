I sent the summary below to Greg yesterday, but want to reconfirm with everyone today - particularly the contract numbers.  The highlighted columns represent those I don't feel are accurate at this point.   I will be meeting individually with everyone to review their spreadsheets one more time and begin discussing the process which now is to start Wednesday.  Below is the draft summary I have at this point - the contractor numbers are the ones in particular I need to get verified.
