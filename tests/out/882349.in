Hi Team!

You are all invited to sit in on the Enron Travel Park training.  Details are below:

DATE:		Tuesday, October 16th
TIME:		11am to approximately 1:30pm
TOPIC:		How to use Enron's travel system on-line and via phone
HOSTS:	Tracy Ramsey (Enron) and Zou Cherry (Travel Agency in the Park)


If you plan to attend, please respond back to this note ASAP for a few reasons:

1.  We will be bringing in lunch and I need to know how many to order

2.  I will need to get you set up in their system prior to Tuesday

3.  I will need to ensure we are set with laptops and other training materials

To give you an idea about the kind of savings you can get by using this Enron feature, here's an example.  I booked a roundtrip flight from Denver>St. Louis which came up as $161, but with the Enron discount, I am paying $119.  As a comparison, on the United website, the same exact trip came in at $302.

Thank you,
Kristen
