Actually, the deal is for 773/day @ into CPA via the Carnegie-Jefferson
interconnect.  The price is NX1 + $0.12/Dth; the contract expires 11/01/00.
This gas only flowed for a part of February and is not flowing for  March.
CPA closed the interconnect with Carnegie for their own needs/system supply.
This gas may not flow for the rest of the contract.  CPA will only operate
the interconnect on a day-to-day basis; no firm is available.  I am to check
with CPA to see if they will do an exchange for this gas.
