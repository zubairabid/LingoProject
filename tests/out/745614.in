Thanks for your continued participation in NomLogic's beta program.  A few things. . .

Sempra Set-up
All of the Sempra users are set-up and prepared to use NomLogic!  Molly and Keith Couch (NomLogic IT) traveled to Connecticut today and spent time gathering feedback from the Sempra users and IT personnel.   Their set-up issues are resolved, and we hope to continue to get good feedback.  If you currently have active deals with Sempra, go for it!

NomLogic-SITARA Interface
The NomLogic-SITARA interface is in production!  In other words, meter changes made in NomLogic interface automatically to SITARA.

Beta Customer Feedback
We do not want you to be burdened with customer feedback, and some of you may have been with Sempra set-up issues.  If a customer is experiencing NomLogic problems, please direct them to the NomLogic team .  Even though the users have our contact information, they may hesitate to call us.  Please encourage them to do so or offer to transfer them directly to us.  Of course, if you can answer their question, please feel free to do so.

More Beta Customers
Many of you do not have active deals with Sempra.  We are in the process of training additional beta customers.  Once the users are ready to go, we will let you know!

Thanks again,
