Quick Change in PG&E NW IT Allocation

Within hours of a FERC vote yesterday ratifying proposed changes in its
interruptible transportation (IT) queue, PG&E Gas Transmission Northwest
announced new procedures effective today.

The Commission rejected shippers complaints to the new scheme and accepted
PG&E NW's tariff sheets as of Oct. 25, saying the revisions were "generally
in accord with industry practice and will simplify capacity allocation
procedures."

Under the revised tariff PG&E NW said "IT capacity will be allocated as
follows:

First to shippers paying maximum rate;

If there are more confirmed IT nominations from shippers all paying the
maximum rate, then IT capacity will be allocated pro-rata to the confirmed
nominations.~ For example, if the capacity constraint were at Station 14, a
shipper with a confirmed nomination paying maximum rate from Stanfield to
Malin would be allocated capacity pro rata with a shipper with a confirmed
nomination at the maximum rate for service from Kingsgate to Malin.

Second to shippers paying discounted rates or negotiated rates at less then
the maximum rate. The discounted/negotiated IT space will be allocated on
highest to lowest total revenue (rate x mileage).~ For example, a shipper
with a confirmed nomination for service with a total revenue per Dth of $0.11
would be awarded capacity ahead of a shipper with a confirmed nomination for
service with a total revenue of $0.10, regardless of the path nominated.

Discounted IT shippers having the same total revenue will be allocated space
on a pro ration of their confirmed nominations."
