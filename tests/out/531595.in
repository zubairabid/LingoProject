Attached is the proposed language from Assembly Member Calderon's office
regarding environmental dispatch (e/d).  As you will recall, e/d language
was removed from the final version of the siting bill, SB 28x, signed by the
Governor so that there would be more time to work out a compromise.  Since
then, Asm. Calderon has been meeting with various stakeholders on this issue
including IEP members and came up with the attached language.  The language
deviates from our initial discussions which centered around limiting e/d to
out-of-market and RMR contracts.  The language now targets the plants that
will operate above and beyond their air permits per the Governor's recent
executive order.  Please review this language and get back to me with any
issues.  If there are more serious concerns with this, I will schedule a
conference call to discuss further.

THANKS.
