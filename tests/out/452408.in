In the public meeting today, the Commissioners approved RTO status for Grid
South, RT01-74 with certain conditions imposed. The conditions are that Grid
South continue to expand with additional members; Santee Cooper must be
included in the Grid South RTO and denies Grid South,s proposed veto rights
(must modify to ensure selection of board members represents more
participation by stakeholders) ) must maintain its independence; and orders
Grid South to resurrect original list of board candidates for another review.

FERC rejected Southern Company,s application, RT01-77, for RTO status finding
that the conditions of Order No. 2000 have not been met. The application is
rejected as being too inclusive. Chair Hebert stated that single company RTO
will not be accepted and are not the future. FERC wants to see good regional
member participation.

Commissioner Massey concurs on Grid South order; dissents in part in Southern
Company order, (expressed dismay over pricing issues finding that since the
application has been rejected, there is no reason to address pricing issues
in rejection).

The Commission discussed the order, EL 01-47, for relief to the California
and western state markets. The order announces certain action to be taken to
increase supply and reduce demand. As stated, the actions are:  1) require
California ISO and transmission owners to file grid enhancements that can be
achieved in short-term; 2) extends and broadens temporary  waivers of
operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for QFs; 3)
waives prior notice requirements and grants market-based rate authority for
wholesale power sales; 4) authorizes retail/wholesale customers to reduce
consumption to resell their load reduction at wholesale at market-based
rates; 5) announces staff conference this Spring to discuss hydro-licensees,
resource agencies the possibility of increased generation consistent with
environmental protection. Addtionally, the order seeks comments by March 30,
1) rate incentives for electric transmission and gas facilities that provide
additional capacity in the short term; 2) use of interconnect authority
(Section 210.d of FPA) to help alleviate impediments to additional supply; 3)
waiving natural gas blanket certificate regulations to increase the dollar
limits for facilities under automatic authorization and prior notice
authorization; 4) offering blanket certificates for construction for
acquisition of portable compressor stations to enhance pipeline capacity to
California; 5) allowing for greater flexibility that license hydroelectric
projects to increase generation while protecting environmental resources.

FERC Commissioners intend to meet with Western state commissioners and other
regulators to discuss price volatility and other FERC related issues that
have recently been identified by the western governors. This will be a
one-day conference.
