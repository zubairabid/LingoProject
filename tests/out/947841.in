Kevin/Karin:

My understanding from Vince is that London is reponsible for the expenses
incurred while their people are here for training, as well as for any of our
people that go to London at their request.

It should be easy for them to expense this airfare for Steve from their office
and charge it to whatever cost center Tony is going to be under in London.
