Mirant has nine gens/mkters signed on to doing a MW cost-benefit study.  They have estimated a total cost of the study to be $75,000 - 100,000 and will use the same consulting firm, EEA, that was used for the NE study. Each of the companies would pay maximum $7500-10,000.

Mirant made its presentation last week at FERC and I attended.  Overall, I thought the study would be useful to FERC in supporting their decision for one NE (and also one MW) study.  The presentation at FERC was headed up by a regulatory person at Mirant rather than the consultant and of course there were some skeptics in the public forum.  Some of the questions raised may have been better answered by the consultants or by someone with more NE trading experience.  However, upon review of the EEA affidavit for the "One RTO Coalition", I think this study would be a benefit to FERC on the MW decisions to be made.

If you agree that supporting this proposed study is a good idea, let me know and I will submit an RCR and follow up with Mirant.
