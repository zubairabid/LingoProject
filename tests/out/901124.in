Further info on the MISO case:
Discussion on the MISO administrative cost adder indicated that the Commission will require that it be charged also to the native load.  This is because all load must be under the RTO tariff.  I spoke with staff after the meeting and was told that this was a minimum RTO requirement and had been stated in the original Southern RTO order.  MISO had not included native load under the RTO tariff, as recently as the latest filings made August 31.  This is a real backdoor way of requiring MISO to put all load under the RTO tariff and was apparently done on the Commission's own initiative.
Midwest utilities had argued that they could not recover the administrative cost adder because they had capped retail rates.  Chairman Wood told them that they could recover the adder because they should be reducing their retail rates because they would not have to provide the same services that the RTO would now provide.
We will have more details when we read the order, but this is another example of this Commission taking bold action on RTOs.
