Hi Britt
A quick update:
1. Joint testing is being planned for the end of next week (16, 17 or 18
August). Please confirm that David Best's recommendation of Steve Jones of
APC Petroleum (UK) is acceptable to you. I understand Steve Jones will be
available from tomorrow and, if retained, should be briefed ASAP for his trip
to Singapore for the joint testing.
2. David  had directed that Neale Gregson take a statement from Eric Tan.
Neale and I have since attended with Eric and a statement is being prepared.
PacMarine is also preparing their second/supplementary report. I hope to have
both Eric's statement and PacMarine's report up to David by the end of the
week for him to give his final opinion on the merits.
3.  We have today sent to Mitsubishi the statement drafted by David.
Best regards
Matt
