mac-
i have a slightly different view on your point #4.  the israelis are actually
pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the
israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks.  the
PNA is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more
access to aquifers under the land.  the isaelis want a desal project for the
PNA so that they can claim that the PNA has a larger water base, and thus
does not need to have more land for access to more water.  the issue is that
there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently
reach the west bank, thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot
point in this discussion, although it will not be due to the lack of
rationale to their discussions.
i think that it is worth pointing out that the US consulate and embassy in
israel have been helpful to us.  from the macro level, there needs to be more
proactive cooperation between the PNA and GOI on this project (due to the
logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below).  furthermore,
it it worth noting that the PNA need to be more willing to adapt their
standards to be more in line with large international transactions, as the
local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome, and will not
benefit the PNA by attracting large scale foreign investment.
please let me know if you wish to discuss this further.
