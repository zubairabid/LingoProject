Good Afternoon Power Users,

This weekend, January 12 - 13, the split of NEWCO & Enron Estate will actually begin.  Specifically, this weekend, we will be moving the estate applications & databases off of their current hardware and onto other available UNIX & NT servers.  This effort will free-up the existing hardware for NEWCO.  This week, we need help from our key users to ensure these changes will not adversely affect the Enron Estate applications by testing the applications on the new hardware.

Below are instructions on how to begin testing:

Stage Testing
Starting Thursday morning, January 10th, the Enron Estate test environment will be setup for user testing.  This test environment is actually a rename of the old "PWRTESTN" environment.  To access the Enron Estate Test environment, please choose "Enpower Estate (pwrtestn)".  The short-cut can be found at:

Start ==> Program ==> Development Applications ==> Stage Environment ==> Enpower ==> Enpower Estate (pwrtestn)

Production Testing
Then, on Sunday morning, January 13th, by 8:00AM CST***, the production Enron Estate environment will be ready for user testing.  To access the Enron Estate Production environment, please choose "Enpower Estate Login".  The short-cut can be found at:

Start ==> Program ==> Business Applications ==>Enpower ==> Enpower Estate Login


Thanks,  David Poston
