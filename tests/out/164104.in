THE FRIDAY BURRITO

"If you aren,t confused, then you don,t understand the problem."

That was a close one.  Favre threw the ball down field to his favorite
receiver last Monday night, Antonio Freeman, in what turned out to be
the last play of the game in overtime.  Viking's defenseman Dishman
flicked the ball up in the air, Freeman went to the ground, but the ball
landed on Freeman,s back.  It slid down Freeman,s jersey, and as he
turned to look, the ball gently poured into Freeman,s waiting open
hands.  The ball and Freeman made a fair catch, and a quick trip to the
end zone.  Game over.  Packers won.

That was the closest and best ending to a football game I can recall in
a long time.

Otherwise it was a ho-hum week.

Oh, yah.  The State of California held its one-party election last
Tuesday, and all members of that party won, I think.  There is no
Republican Party anymore in California.  Those politicians have been
exported like our in-state electrons under price-caps to Arizona or
Nevada.  The radical minority is now firmly in place.  This will make
power-related legislation a hoot in the coming legislative session.  A
veto-proof Assembly and Senate with a $7 billion surplus.  Jeez.  What
would you care to bet that we don,t see one nickel of that $7 billion in
tax reductions? You know we,re in trouble when Lady Bird Bowen and Steve
Peace claim that they are each to the far right of their Democratic
colleagues.

Speaking of Mr. Peace, we had a chance to meet for the first time, and
have a real conversation.  It was in Washington, D.C., a good neutral
turf, at the hotel where quite a few other Californians and I were
staying.  We were attending FERC,s technical conference on the Order
issued last week.  It was all an accident, I suppose.  I was sipping a
brewski with CMUA,s Tony Braun in the hotel bar.  I was explaining to
Tony what a terrible thing it was for CMUA to support a return to cost
of service rates, and what are we going to do about the ISO,s GMC
filing?  In walks Peace and his legislative aide, John Rozsa.  So, being
a nice guy, I utilized your hard-earned WPTF dues, and bought them both
a drink.  A bloody Mary for Rozsa and decaf coffee for  the Senator.

Two-and-one-half hours later we were still drinking and talking.  I hate
to admit it, but I had a good time.  "Why do you call John Fielder +The
Great Warrior,?" Peace asked me after I shared with him my nickname for
JF.  I told him the story, skipping all the nicknames handed out in past
Burritos to the two gentlemen in my then present company.  A lot of what
we discussed Peace repeated to the FERC Commissioners the next day.
Below, I review the logic of his case concerning the future of
California,s restructured power industry.  For the first time I see the
method in his madness.  He takes a very political view of things, which
means economics and physics don,t hold a candle to political factors.

We also talked about the power business, movie production (Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes V is coming out soon.  I asked wasn,t ATKT  I through IV
enough?  He said he was going to keep on doing it until he got it
right.  I offered that that was exactly what Glen Campbell said when he
married his fifth wife.), Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football (we
don,t like DM on MNF), and why he ever took an interest in the power
industry (answer: he goes into it and out of our industry from time to
time, just for a visit).

And at the moment, I am working on the Burrito in my DC hotel room,
watching the clock advance into the wee hours of the night.  What,s a
Thursday night without a Burrito to write?  I won't finish this week,s
edition on time.  I only have my travel computer with me.  So, the
Burrito will go out Friday, or Saturday.  Be patient, and don,t get
pushy.  If it,s going to take another week to declare George W the new
President, assuming the Florida vote remains stable, then you can wait a
day or two for the Burrito.

By the way.  Last week,s Burrito was a great companion for those of you
without much humor in your life.  Pity.  Many of the newer readers
lapped up the ISO Going Out of Business items.  One reader wanted to
know if they could purchase the Market Power Exercise Bike in
California, export to Oregon where it sells for ten times the price, and
then bring it back in the State.  I said you could do that, but it would
be wrong.  I would report that person to the Market Surveillance
Committee, and as punishment that person would have to read every
document the ISO,s Department of Market Analysis ever wrote.  Some
aren,t even colored in yet.

Here is this week,s menu.
