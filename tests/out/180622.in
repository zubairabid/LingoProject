I would like to step back to the plug number for T&D and suggest another
method.  The plug, as I understand it, is calculated by building up
generation cost from the MOU presentation and substracting that number from
the total utility revenues reflected in the Lynch decision.  Unless the
generation component reflected in the MOU and Lynch's decision are the same
(and I don't think they are), this won't result in a proper number.
For PGE, I am very confident that their non-generation costs are equal to
$.0391 per kWh based upon PGE data filed in the rate design hearing.  That
rate multiplied by 81,991 results T&D cost of $3,206.  I think this is the
number that should be used for PGE.  I don't think you should tie to the
$11,400 number.  The T&D number would need to be adjusted for the
core/non-core adjustment factor (core = 125% of average).
For SCE, assuming that the system average generation rate is $.073 and that
the existing total system average rate is $.1132, that leaves a
non-generation system average rate of $.042 which equates to total T&D cost
of $3,519.  Because the PGE and SCE systems have a similar per unit rate for
T&D (4.02 v 3.91) and the mix between core and non-core are similar I think
using the 125% factor is reasonable for SCE.
Going through similar calculations and assumptions I come up with a T&D per
unit cost of $.0623 for SDGE.  Because their mix of core and non-core is
heavily tilted toward core the above factor would not be applicable.
Perhaps, not adjusting it at all would not be too far off.
Call me if you have questions.
