Hey Joe,

Please have trade NZ7278 rebooked to Sanguine, Ltd.  I am sending the
attached credit worksheet to Legal so we should include additional language
within the Annex B.  Once you recieve this language from legal, please send
the confirmation without further delay.  Let me know if their are any other
trades that I should be addressing at this time, outside the e-mail I sent
you this morning, and I will address asap.

thanks
brant
