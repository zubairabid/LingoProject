On Friday we will be receiving the remaining customer list from credit, due
to the timescales I am asking for turnaround on the customer matrix and
master agreement review by the end of play Tuesday 12th October.

Any problems with this please notify me immediately as we are now running up
against very tight deadlines in terms of getting all of the information in
the system for the launch schedule.

Thanks

Louise

Mark,
On another note we are requesting a review of the blanket decision which has
been made to prevent any regulated utility from completing any financial
transactions, if we are not prepared to do the due diligence on which ones
can transact and which ones can not - is this our responsibility or theirs?
ie their decision whether to trade or not.
