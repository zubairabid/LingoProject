Since I am Chairman of the NERC Interchange Subcommittee (Policy 3 Interchange), Grid South has approached my group to review a proposal that it become the interchange scehduling agent for all its members.

This is a preliminary proposal at this time and Grid South is "shopping" how its proposal meets Policy 3 requirements.

I would like you all to point out "holes" in their proposal that can establish road-blocks for non-control areas from competing.  Assuming that multiple control areas will be part of their structure, please consider: "What more should GridSouth do and what less should its control area members do?"

I do not want to compromise my leaderhip position at NERC, so please keep these documents and discussions internal to Enron at this time.

Grid South representatives will be at the Interchange Subcommittee Friday the 29th, so please give me your open and honest opinions by Thursday evening.

Thank You
