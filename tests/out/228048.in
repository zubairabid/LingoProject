We have tentatively planned for two partners from the Chicago law firm of
Sidley & Austin to come visit us in our offices on Friday, Aug. 11 and to
give a presentation.  I say "tentatively" because I have not yet been able to
confirm Mark Haedicke's availability on that date -- I will try to do that as
soon as possible.

I would expect the presentation to take 1 to 2 hours -- I'm sure it could
take longer if we wanted it to, i.e., if there turned out to be some matters
that we wanted to discuss in further detail with them.  I think a morning
meeting would suit most people's availability better than an afternoon one;
please share your thoughts on this with me.

Enclosed is a rough outline of an agenda I have suggested to them for their
presentation.  If there are other matters you would like to hear them
discuss, I encourage you to let me know; I will pass all suggestions along to
them.

As most of you probably know, attorneys have a duty of strict confidentiality
to their clients, and this duty attaches from the moment a consultation
begins (regardless of whether a formal "engagement" has commenced).
Violation of this duty is grounds for disciplinary action by the governing
bar association.   On the other hand, I realize that we do not have an
established relationship with this firm or these lawyers.  All of that being
said, I will leave it to each of you as to your comfort level in asking
particular questions or sharing particular information.
