Rita,

Tennessee pipeline has provided us with a summary of volumetric balances per contract. We are currently trying to work with them to clear out these imbalances and/or parked gas that is on their system for ENA and ENA Upstream.

I will provide a copy of the summary for you when you return. Can you please review our data and verify if we have the same numbers and what dollars, if any, we owe for the specific volume amounts that are in question.

Thanks for your help.

Maria
