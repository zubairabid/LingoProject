Apparently, the London office was able to justify multiple functional currencies for a single legal entity.  Beth Apollo felt that we could make a strong case to have separate accounting entities for power and gas, each with their own functional currencies.  Please read through the attached documents and I will set up a meeting to discuss this further next week.  We can get Shelly Stubbs or Beth Apollo involved as well if needed.
Thanks
