Okay, the general consensus is to input ALL manual wires into MIDAS.  Again, this is imperative for RAC in order to calculate IRR on the individual assets.  If RAC does not get these cash items in their upload, they will be calling with questions.  I'm sure we all agree that the fewer questions they have, the better off we are.

Each accountant is responsible for inputting their own wires into the MIDAS cash database.

Dana and Rufino, before filing copies of wires, please ensure that they have been input into the MIDAS cash database.  If they have not, please remind the accountants.  If this is a recurring problem, please let me know.

Thanks,
Marnie
