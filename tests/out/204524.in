Dirk Ellison with EOG has contacted me twice this morning about the EFM at
the location. He told me they planned to come on Tuesday evening. I have told
him both times that we could not proceed until I receive word from you and
Earl that all the agreements are in place. He had contacted Jerry Ball, who
contacted their marketing, and their reply was to tell us (in the field) to
proceed. I tried to explain that we needed that go-ahead from our folks, not
theirs. Also, an issue came up on the operations conference call this morning
about quality equipment - H2S, H2O, Sampler, Gas Chromatograph. The team had
told Rich it was about a 20Mmcfd point, Dirk indicated to me they were
looking at more like 16Mmcfd Commercial power is about a mile away from the
location per the operations team and some of this equipment could require
power.
We have got LOTS going on this week, could someone explain the situation to
EOG?
