Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of
New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise
inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along
with them....

Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns
when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to
an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed
ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species
Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing
happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the
status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The
permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air
group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I
told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that
the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken
care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation
verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station
sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the
Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a
call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys
with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as
to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were
expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would
schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to
do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping
authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without
Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to
whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo
Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these
types of issues.

Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first
became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay
issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from
the EPA.
