I would have responded sooner, but I was on the 9:30 EWS conference call.
I am planning to go.  I'm pretty sure Jane Tholt, who trades El Paso on the West gas desk, will go.  Suzanne Calcagno has also indicated an interest so she may go as well.
Jane's major concern at this time is that El Paso doesn't mess with the pooling procedures.  Their proposal calls for increasing the number of pools on the system from the current six to twenty, which the Desk feels would impair liquidity.
I wouldn't look for a lot of progress at this conference.  The EOC full-requirements customers are going to be howling about having their flexibility restricted in any way, and the other firm customers who have CD limits are going to howl about the full requirements customers having a secondary priority superior to theirs.  This same proposal was on the table and they couldn't reach a compromise in six months of settlement conferences working with the chief FERC ADR person on the Amoco/Burlington complaint case.  Our preference is with the CD customers' position, but if the full requirements customers don't get some kind of accommodation, they will never settle.  Then if FERC rules against them, they will take it to the appeals court and maybe further.  This is a BIG issue for them.
