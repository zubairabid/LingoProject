Just to pile on with the issues, I will add a few thoughts of my own for
issues that we might want to consider in our November 20 comments.
Re: the application of the price cap to only PX and ISO, Commissioner Massey
is not totally on board.  He specifically asked about capping the forward
market.  He raised the idea that he had gotten from the San Diego hearing
that there be an accepted forward contract for a specified timeframe (18-24
months) and specified rate, and that all loads must buy a minimum percentage
of their needs from this contract.
A staffer (Don Gelinas) asked whether the forward/bilateral market
(presumably uncapped) could take care of investment recovery so that
generation not be cancelled in California.
Dynegy and other marketers raised the issue of the test to be used by the
Commission in reviewing transactions above the soft cap.  Specifically, what
is opportunity cost?  As long as the test is not known until after the fact,
there will be lack of secuity selling into the California and greater
incentive to sell elsewhere.
Hobbs from Williams raised the possibility that if the Commission does not
eliminate the soft cap (his preferred approach), that the cap should be
temporary and escalating and there should be limited time for raising issues
and retaining the refund liability (he suggested that the refund liability be
only for one month).
Many, especially the utilities, raised their position that the Commission
should not institute penalties only on the load.  They claimed this was
one-sided and suggested if penalties were required, they needed to be applied
to the supply side as well.  They also argued that the load could not meet
the 5% test.
Massey had a concern at the end of the day that the Commission's
encouragement of forward contracts will be stymied by the CPUC by their
authority in reviewing prudence of the utilities' purchases.
Larcamp asked at the end of the day for information on the cost of generation
before deregulation - normalized for gas prices and emmission prices of
today.  The marketer on the panel added that we would need to include
stranded costs.
There was almost no support for the single price auction in California.
The California politicians argued that the ISO Board structure needed to be
changed, but that California had jurisdiction to change it, not FERC.  A
Court battle was threatened.
