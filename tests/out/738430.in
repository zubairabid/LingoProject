We must notify the Control room (GENCO)  personnel concerning any deviation from the preschedule.
For example,   when we have availability,    or even "must sell"  situations off of Frontera,  the Control Room must revise their Resource Plan.    They need to revise in order to prevent an Area Control Error problem.

They have the same deadline (two hours before hour ending)  that we face in submitting QSE trades - give them timely info so that they can get their side in.


For now,  you can use the Stento (dial 5 432) or telephone 877-294-3900.     Of course,  you can just knock on the door.
In Ercot only,   we are allowed to exchange information with the control room.    No other region has this capability.


Thanks,
