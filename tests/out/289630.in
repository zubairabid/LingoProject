Just as a heads up...

The web site that serves data for Kinder Morgan, Transcolorado, NGPL, etc. is having issues as I write this.  The following message comes up when trying to receive point data:

An error occurred while executing the page. Please use the "Back" button on your browser to try again, or try again at a later time. If the problem persists, please contact ApplicationName Support (user@kne.com).
The error message is:
[INTERSOLV][ODBC SQL Server driver][SQL Server]ct_results(): user api layer: internal Client Library error: Read from the server has timed out.

Basically, this means their server currently has issues.  I just wanted to send this out as a heads up that we could potentially miss some cycle information for the morning reports.  Hopefully, the site will stabilize before then.


Thanks,
Chris
