Every day they would sit together to eat their lunch. They</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; discovered that they both brought chicken sandwiches every day! This</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>went</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; on all through the fourth and fifth grades until one day he noticed that</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; her sandwich wasn't a chicken sandwich. He said, "Hey, how come you're</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>not</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; eating chicken, don't you like it anymore?"</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt;</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; She said " I love it but I have to stop eating it." "Why?" he asked. She</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; pointed to her lap and said "Cause I'm starting to grow little feathers</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; down there!" "Let me see" he said. "Okay" and she pulled up her skirt.</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>He</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; looked and said, "That's right you are, better not eat any more</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>chicken."</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; He kept eating his chicken sandwiches until one day he brought peanut</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; butter. He said to the little girl, "I have to stop eating chicken</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; sandwiches, I'm starting to get feathers down there too!"</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; She asked if she could look so he pulled down his pants for her. She</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>said</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; "Oh, my God, it's too late for you, you've already got the neck and the</FONT><BR><FONT SIZE=4>&gt; gizzards."</FONT><BR></P>
