$18 billion power tab projected: An immediate outcry greets Davis' plan for
state energy purchases through June 2002.
By Emily Bazar and Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 1, 2001)
Seeking to sell his energy rescue plan to reluctant Republicans, Gov. Gray
Davis on Monday released a long-awaited financial plan that shows the state
will spend more than $18 billion on electricity through June 2002, but can
maneuver the energy crisis without additional rate increases or draining the
state budget.
His projections, however, were immediately attacked by lawmakers and industry
experts, who called them overly optimistic and unrealistic.
The plan, which Davis is using to bolster his energy effort with legislators
and Wall Street, is based on a series of assumptions, among them that the
state will pay significantly less for electricity on the spot market during
the hottest summer months than it pays now, and that dozens of shuttered
small generators will start selling discount electricity again.
"No one has a crystal ball into the future," state Treasurer Phil Angelides
told reporters. "The administration's plan makes some assumptions, as any
plan must. The question is, are they reasonable assumptions, and what do we
need to do collectively to make the plan succeed?"
The Democratic governor has long faced criticism for refusing to divulge
details about the state's power purchases, both on the expensive spot market
and under long-term contracts.
Last week, the issue was thrust into the forefront when Assembly Republicans
told the governor they would not vote for a bill authorizing the sale of $10
billion in revenue bonds to pay for the state's power purchases until they
received additional information.
If legislators don't pass the bill -- which requires a two-thirds majority
and, therefore, Republican votes -- Angelides said the state might miss a May
8 deadline for closing on a crucial $4.1 billion bridge loan.
On Monday, Davis relented, releasing his response in the form of an
inch-thick document filled with tables, bar graphs and projections. The plan
gives the first detailed, month-by-month account of the state Department of
Water Resources' expected power purchases through 2002.
But the projections failed to win votes immediately in the Assembly
Republican caucus, where Minority Floor Leader Dave Cox said he is not yet
ready to support the proposed $10 billion in bonds. The caucus will meet
today to decide what to do next, he said.
"Many of the assumptions are questionable and there is no answer as to what
will happen if the assumptions prove incorrect," said Assemblyman Keith
Richman, R-Sun Valley. "I'm very concerned."
Davis' plan relies on numerous estimates, including likely summer
temperatures and annual rainfall, and an assumption that Californians will
use 7 percent less energy this year than they did last year.
Private consultants who helped draft the plan also predicted that most of the
small generators that stopped producing electricity because they hadn't been
paid for months will resume production at discounted rates. They argued that
their assumptions are conservative and allow for unexpected changes.
"There are lots of variables that are not simply assumptions," said Joseph
Fichera, an investment banker with Saber Partners in New York City and a
consultant to the administration. "I would say probably 80 percent is what we
know are facts and 20 percent are expectations."
Republican lawmakers and others were particularly uncomfortable with the
administration's conclusion that the state will spend an average of $195 per
megawatt-hour for electricity on the spot market in July, August and
September, the hottest months of the year when electricity is expected to be
sold at a premium.
Some have predicted that the costs could go much higher.
"There's a reasonable chance this summer that the state will be paying $1
billion per week" for electricity, Severin Borenstein, head of the University
of California Energy Institute, told state regulators last week.
With summer prices forecast to be $500 to $700 per megawatt-hour, and the
state Department of Water Resources expected to need more than 200,000
megawatt-hours a day, it would be easy to rack up billion-dollar power bills,
he said in an interview.
The state spent $90 million on power on a single day last week, but prices
declined somewhat afterward, according to the governor's press office.
Davis' Cabinet secretary, Susan Kennedy, defended the estimated summertime
cost, saying the state has secured enough long-term contracts to limit its
exposure to the most expensive spot market prices.
"It's almost impossible to say what's plausible and what isn't," said Mike
Florio, an attorney with The Utility Reform Network, a Bay Area consumer
group.
It makes sense that power costs, overall, would drop as more long-term
contracts kick in and the state buys less electricity on the spot market, he
said. But many of those contracts are still being negotiated.
"What this assumes about contracts that have not been signed is the really
interesting question," he said.
Assemblyman Tony Strickland, R-Thousand Oaks, said the Davis administration
hasn't been able to provide assurances that if bonds are sold now, more won't
be needed in the future.
"Their assumptions are nothing more than educated guesses," Strickland said.
"And the educated guess of the Legislature was that we wouldn't be in the
power buying business in the first place."
Kennedy conceded that the administration's plan has its limits, and won't
prevent the state from experiencing rolling blackouts in the coming months if
prices get too high or its assumptions are proved wrong.
"The bottom line will be we will either need to borrow a little bit more or
we're going to see more blackouts," she said.

PUC seeks to retain PG&E control
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 1, 2001)
SAN FRANCISCO -- Warning that California consumers and the state economy
could be in grave danger, the state Public Utilities Commission urged a
federal bankruptcy judge Monday not to sever the commission's regulatory
control of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
On April 9, three days after filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection,
PG&E petitioned the Bankruptcy Court to block parts of a recent PUC order.
PG&E said the provisions conflicted with bankruptcy rules and interfered with
its legal right to recover skyrocketing wholesale energy coasts.
The provisions at issue -- adopted by the PUC on March 27 along with a 30
percent rate increase -- imposed new accounting requirements on the
utilities, but the consequences were potentially dramatic. Depending on the
way certain costs are counted, PG&E may or may not be entitled to early
termination of an electricity rate freeze adopted by the Legislature five
years ago.
PG&E said the accounting provisions changed the rules retroactively and
artificially extended the rate freeze.
But the PUC disagreed -- and said the issue is even larger. In a series of
documents filed Monday, the commission characterized PG&E's petition as "the
first step in (the company's) plan to deregulate itself." If PG&E succeeds in
stripping California of its power to regulate its electric utilities, the
commission said, "PG&E may be able to claim an artificial end to the rate
freeze, which could result in drastically higher retail electric rates. The
harm to California's consumers and economy could be grave."
The commission said that the petition should be dismissed on grounds of
"sovereign immunity" -- the state's right not to be sued by private parties
-- and because the nation's bankruptcy laws bar interference with the state's
exercise of its regulatory powers.
"The accounting proposal the commission adopted was illegal before we filed
for Chapter 11," PG&E spokesman Ron Low said Monday. "Now that we are in
Chapter 11, it not only affects our shareholders, it also impacts our
creditors."

Legislators propose tax on energy profits
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 1, 2001)
With power producers reaping profits that increased fivefold last year, some
state lawmakers are pushing a tax on future earnings as the best way to keep
generators honest.
California would recoup 100 percent of power profits deemed unreasonable
through a "windfall profits tax" proposed by state Sen. Nell Soto, D-Pomona.
Her bill, SB 1x, cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee on Monday on a
7-3 vote.
The proposal would force generators to give the state any money collected
above a reasonable limit determined by the state Public Utilities Commission.
That money probably would be doled out in equal portions to state taxpayers,
possibly through income tax returns, though details remain vague.
The bill is aimed principally at five out-of-state companies -- AES Corp.,
Duke Energy Corp., Dynegy Inc., Mirant and Reliant -- that bought California
power plants under deregulation and saw profits increase last year at an
average of 508 percent, according to Democratic estimates.
"What this bill says is, 'You can't come in and rip us off,' " said Senate
President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.
Critics said the proposal would only discourage companies from building new
power plants in California or producing power when the state needs it most.
During the worst of California's energy blues, utilities and the state have
paid generators and marketers well above 30 cents per kilowatt-hour.
Soto has suggested an 8 cents a kilowatt-hour cap, meaning that any price
charged above that would be considered unreasonable. If a generator were to
charge 30 cents, for instance, it would have to return 22 cents to the state
in the form of the new tax.
Although the proposal could have the direct effect of knocking down soaring
energy prices, it would also send a message that the state will not tolerate
price gouging, some lawmakers said.
"We have been royally mistreated," said Sen. Jack Scott, D-Altadena, a
co-author of the bill. "And we have allowed a great deal of California money
to leave the state at the expense of ratepayers, taxpayers and businesses."
But energy producers challenged the bill, saying it would simply discourage
companies from building plants in California or from upgrading existing
facilities.
The tax "does nothing to solve the fundamental problem in California, and
that's mainly the lack of supply," said Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for
Houston-based Reliant.
"There is no way, given natural-gas prices today, that we could make any
money under the price caps in this bill," said Carl London, a lobbyist for
InterGen, a Boston-based generator.
In turn, the state's businesses would suffer through sustained power
blackouts because supply would remain low, said Carrie Lee-Coke, general
counsel of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association.
"There is one simple truth, and that is there is too little energy
production," Lee-Coke said, calling Soto's bill the "wrong medicine" for
California.
Although electricity generated in California would be affected, it is unclear
whether the state can legally impose restrictions on power from outside the
state.
Republicans on Monday opposed the plan, citing disincentives for power
companies to boost supply and resultant blackouts. But the bill needs support
only from majority Democrats to pass.
"The economic reality is that the people cannot afford to be gouged any
longer," Soto said.

Dan Walters: Davis finally generates an energy plan, but will it work?


(Published May 1, 2001)
After months of issuing buzzwords, sound bites and bold predictions that
proved wrong, Gov. Gray Davis finally unveiled Monday what aides said was a
comprehensive plan to shepherd California through the energy crisis.
The thick compendium of charts, tables and narrative, prepared by a financial
consulting firm and peddled to legislators and journalists by a squad of
administration aides, was designed to bolster Davis' case for legislative
approval of a $12.5 billion bond issue. About half the money would repay the
state's beleaguered general fund, which has been drained for power purchases,
and the rest would ease the impact on ratepayers' bills for future power
purchases.
Administration officials insisted it is a realistic scheme based on
reasonable assumptions -- but legislators of both parties remained skeptical
since the governor's previous assumptions and projections about the crisis
had proved to be uniformly wrong. It remains uncertain, therefore, whether
the bond issue bill that the administration says is vital will win
legislative approval this week -- at least in the size Davis is seeking. Even
Democrats are wary.
Legislative analysts zeroed in on a couple of assumptions that are central to
the workability of the plan:
That Californians will severely curtail their energy use this summer in
response to supply shortages, a big ad campaign and sharp price increases.
That the state can buy spot market power this summer at rates far below what
it has been paying and what the power futures market indicates will be the
summer spot price.
If either of those two assumptions is off the mark, the state could face
severe and prolonged blackouts and/or could go billions of dollars deeper
into debt.
Administration aides insisted that their assumptions are reasonable, based on
what is known now about power consumption habits and the availability and
price of power for the summer, when demand usually rises sharply to run air
conditioning.
"This is not a guess," Susan Kennedy, a top Davis aide, told reporters in
response to sharp questioning about the plan's projection of making spot
market power purchases during the summer at an average of $195 per
megawatt-hour, 40 percent less than what the state is paying now. The current
futures market price for California-delivered power in July and August is
about $500 per megawatt-hour, but administration officials insist they have
contracted for much of the summer peak load at lower costs, leaving less
exposure to the spot market.
If it all works as Davis hopes, customers of the three major utilities --
about 70 percent of Californians -- will see a sharp boost in their rates
soon, and that will be enough to finance the $20 billion in power purchase
debts incurred by the utilities and the state so far, plus pay for future
purchases.
The bonds would pick up the costs not covered by the raised rates in the
early years of the scheme, then be paid off later as rates remain high but
power costs go down. A sharp decline in power costs later in the decade is
another major assumption in Davis' plan, based on still another assumption
that massive generating facilities will be built within a few years.
The administration's new set of assumptions replaces suppositions that proved
to be very wrong, such as Davis' oft-expressed belief that power rates would
not have to be raised. And the new scheme also includes elements that Davis
had rejected last year, such as long-term contracting for power and the
ability of rate increases to drive down consumption.
Will it work? Will ratepayers, taxpayers, voters, financiers, legislators and
others be persuaded that Davis finally has his act together and that his
scheme is workable and fair? And will consumer activists be placated by a
plan that assumes ratepayers will shoulder the utilities' massive debts? Stay
tuned. This crisis is still a long way from being a footnote to California
history.

Soaring energy bills hurt eateries: Many restaurants in capital area, despite
good patronage, expect to raise menu prices.
By Cathleen Ferraro
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 1, 2001)
So far, it appears to be the economic slump that wasn't.
Across the region, most restaurateurs say they aren't seeing patrons pull
back on how often they eat out or what they order. That's significant because
dining out is one of the first luxuries people typically eliminate when times
get rough -- or even appear to be slowing down.
At the same time, restaurant owners who say business is good remain anxious
about the relentless energy crisis. They complain about big utility bills
that promise to stay bloated through the summer and about higher operating
costs from vendors now passing along their own inflated energy expenses.
That all adds up to pricier menus.
"I hoped not to increase prices, but there's no slack when basic utilities
are so high now," said Barbara Mikacich, owner of Sacramento's Andiamo
restaurant, which expects to come out with a new menu in June.
With a few exceptions, local bakery cafes, pizza shops, swanky steakhouses
and more are about to raise food prices while trying to cut back on energy
use. Restaurants are taking such steps because they're bracing for more
energy problems and fear that the economic downturn -- while not obvious now
-- could be around the corner.
"We're watching all the little things," said Mark Platt, operating partner at
P.F. Chang's China Bistro in Roseville where sales are still strong. "But
there's no dramatic way for us to save on our use of gas here. We have to use
woks."
No menu price hikes or staff layoffs are in the wind at P.F. Chang's, Platt
said. But the popular restaurant has changed some of its routine tasks to
offset gas and electric utility bills that have climbed from a combined
$12,500 a month when it opened in September to $16,000 now.
So each morning, cooks at P.F. Chang's no longer spend 20 minutes over
gas-fired flames removing carbon from the bottom of nine main woks. Now they
get the job done in five minutes.
Meanwhile, the restaurant's timers have been adjusted so that lights and air
conditioners turn on later in the day and shut off sooner.
Elsewhere in Roseville, Carvers Steaks & Chops -- traditionally a lunchtime
hot spot with developers, bankers and other professionals -- stopped using
its five gas fireplaces.
"We used to run them from 11 a.m. to 11 p.m., six days a week," said general
manager Gary Kowalsky. "But we quit lighting them because they're strictly
for ambience."
Prompting that change is Carvers' combined utility bill. It used to run
$6,000 a month but has jumped to $10,000.
No layoffs are planned at Carvers. Menu price hikes took effect six weeks ago
when the restaurant added 50 cents to $1 to the prices for steak dishes.
At Casey's Bakery & Cafe on Sacramento's Folsom Boulevard, the gas bill has
doubled since February, said owner Casey Hayden. So instead of running
convection ovens "all day long," as he put it, the shop organizes jobs now so
that more pastries and desserts bake at the same time, reducing use of the
cafe's gas ovens.
In mid-March, Casey's reduced its operating hours from six days a week down
to just three, Friday through Sunday, in response to the energy crunch,
stagnant walk-in business during the week and an increase in wholesale
accounts.
Sacramento's Cafe Melange at 24th Street and Second Avenue also slashed hours
due to higher utility costs, closing now at 7 p.m. instead of 11 p.m. Owner
Marrie Morris said she may raise prices in the next month or two.
Heating and cooling the large warehouse environment of Fox & Goose Public
House on R Street has always been challenging. But now the midtown restaurant
is facing a Pacific Gas and Electric bill that topped $1,200 in March -- or
double the amount from a year earlier.
That strain on top of higher produce, dairy and labor costs has prompted Fox
& Goose to print a new menu due out in June. It will include some of the most
popular items from the now-closed Greta's Cafe -- previously operated by Fox
& Goose owner Allyson Dalton -- and several higher priced items.
"About 50 percent of the menu is going up, but nominally, 2 to 3 percent,"
said Dalton.
Sacramento's Original Pete's pizza chain, which is slated to open a Davis
outlet, its sixth, this week, cut off its janitorial service. The cleaning
duties will be handled by staffers. The restaurant also turned off many
lights and now runs just one oven instead of two during slow times. It, too,
plans to raise menu prices soon.
"We will take a very modest increase across the board, about 3 percent," said
founder Steve Presson, who also noted "early warning signs" of an economic
slowdown, including more customers writing bad checks, credit card numbers
being denied and the use of fraudulent cards.
Now with the threat of rolling summer blackouts, restaurateurs are even
edgier because such power outages might discourage dining out, typically more
popular during warm weather and extra daylight hours.
A blackout at Carvers, the Roseville steakhouse, for example, would mean a
shutdown of its gas valves and computer-operated cash register system, said
manager Kowalsky.
"I hope there's some resolution to all of this," he said. "I can't imagine
anything worse than a building full of hungry people who you can't serve."

Empowering the public
Obstacles keep cities out of energy


(Published April 30, 2001)

In a city the size of Davis, how many citizens does it take to kill an
initiative to create a public power agency and remove PG&E as the supplier of
electricity? Only three. That's because, under state law, a five-member
government agency, the county Local Agency Formation Commission (LAFCO),
which operates largely in obscurity, can reject the proposal before it even
gets to the ballot box.
Over the past several decades, laws such as this have made it harder for
communities to leave the domain of the investor-owned utilities and turn
power into a public enterprise. Sacramento's long struggle to create its
municipal utility district (SMUD) began in the 1920s. It took two decades of
fighting a resistant PG&E for SMUD to get into the distribution business. If
today's laws were in effect back then, Sacramentans might still be fighting,
or have given up long ago.
Amid the pile of energy-related legislation in the capitol is one that seeks
to remove these roadblocks to public power. At the heart of SB 23x by Sens.
Nell Soto of Pomona and John Burton of San Francisco are two valuable
reforms. If the private utilities don't manage to kill this bill, the future
will provide interesting choices for communities that are beginning to assess
their energy options.
The first reform in SB 23x would be to prevent LAFCOs from blocking elections
to decide whether to create a public power agency. LAFCOs now hold this veto
power. This is how residents in and around the city of Davis were prevented
last year from voting on a public power initiative on the ballot. They had
thousands of signatures on their initiative petitions. But they didn't have
three votes on LAFCO. SB 23x would give LAFCO an advisory role, so that
voters can take their findings into consideration.
The second reform would change what happens when a newly formed public power
agency decides to purchase the local electric distribution lines from PG&E. A
law passed in the early 1990s gave PG&E considerable leverage in court to
challenge whether it's necessary for the municipal utility to buy its wires.
PG&E seeks to substitute its will for that of the voters. SB 23x returns to
the municipal utility the legal presumption that it can take over the lines,
leaving the courts to settle on the appropriate price. This is the proper
role of the courts.
A new municipal utility doesn't necessarily have to buy the lines and get
into the distribution business. It may simply buy power in bulk and pass on
the savings to its citizens. The first step is for communities to assess
their options. Davis residents are once again mulling secession from PG&E, as
are activists in Fresno, communities within Orange County and San Francisco.
It's too soon to say whether these seeds of a modern-day public power
movement ultimately come to fruition. Yet the mere threat of secession acts
as an appropriate check against the investor-owned utilities. Communities are
not their hostages. SB 23x returns to communities the power of choice.

Daniel Weintraub: An energy trader says it's time to limit profits


(Published May 1, 2001)

In a sea of angry finger-pointing, name-calling and ridicule, Keith Bailey
stands out as an island of calm, a lonely voice of reason who understands
that a company's long-term self-interest is about more than how much money it
can make today.
Most Californians probably have never heard of Bailey, a Kansas City native
and chief executive officer of Tulsa-based Williams Cos. -- a private energy
trader that has profited handsomely from the state's recent miseries. But
Golden Staters from Gov. Gray Davis on down ought to embrace this Oklahoma
resident. He might be the man who saves our future.
Bailey is proposing that federal electricity regulators place temporary caps
on the profits that he and his competitors may earn between now and fall
2002, when supply and demand will be closer to balance and sanity might
return to the West's energy market.
His rationale is this: To save California's private electricity market, new
power plants are desperately needed. But not enough of those plants will be
built if generators are not confident they will be paid for the product they
already are providing.
Californians, though, don't want to promise payment without knowing they will
be able to afford the bill. Short-term caps on profits, Bailey believes, are
the best way to ease the state's fears, get everybody paid and move on to a
system that works -- for suppliers and customers.
"One of the things we are hoping to do with our proposal is create something
that California can look at and say, 'So long as prices are determined on
this basis, we're prepared to pay,' " Bailey said in an interview. "This is a
mechanism that lets the state say, 'We're not signing a blank check. We don't
know what the price is going to be, but we do know how it will be
determined.' "
Bailey's proposal is different from the limited price caps approved last week
by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission -- and far better for California.
The federal caps would come with all sorts of strings attached, would kick in
only during emergencies and would be focused on prices, not profits. Bailey
is proposing that all power sold from now through summer 2002 be priced at
the cost of producing it, plus a profit of 15 percent. That's more than a
regulated utility would make but less than most private companies seek, and
far less than electricity providers have been earning of late.
Cynics might note that Bailey is proposing caps only after his company has
squeezed all it can from California. The firm reported last week that profits
doubled in the first quarter of 2001 over a year ago, with pretax income from
its energy services nearly tripling, to $600 million. Much of the 4,000
megawatts of electricity that Williams controls in California is already
committed in long-term contracts -- so Bailey has relatively little to lose
if what remains can only be sold at controlled prices.
But here is at least one measure of Bailey's sincerity: His company still is
owed $252 million for electricity it has provided California. And he's not
insisting that the debt be paid before his proposed profit caps take effect,
or even as part of the deal.
"Clearly there is a past that has to be dealt with," he said. "Whether that
ultimately gets dealt with in bankruptcy court or negotiations with the
parties, it will sort itself out one way or another. Perhaps if we find
prices that work going forward, that could be used as a framework."
Bailey, an engineer by training, says no one should mistake his proposal for
a lack of confidence in free markets. He still firmly believes that a
deregulated energy market would be best for California and the rest of the
West in the long term. He just wants to make sure there is a long term.
Bailey is watching, and listening, to California. He hears talk of seizing
power plants, of turning to a public power system. He describes these ideas
as Draconian and says they would not solve the problem. But he also knows
there is a limit to what Californians -- and their elected leaders -- can
take.
"I recognize we live in a democracy, and lots of things could happen," he
said.
What he is proposing, in effect, is a safety valve. He wants to limit the
market in order to save it.
"This is an extraordinary situation," Bailey said. "We need to help create
some breathing room. ... We all have to work together, and this is the right
thing to do."
Bailey's proposal, made at a conference of energy producers and traders in
Oklahoma last week, was almost lost amid all the focus on the price caps
approved in Washington. But there is still time to give the idea the
attention it deserves. Properly nourished, it could be the breakthrough that
solves this crisis. Davis and others in California should seize the moment.

Power Companies Step Up Lobbying


By JULIE TAMAKI and MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writers

SACRAMENTO--As California's electricity crisis exploded this year, so
did lobbying by energy companies.
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., which has filed for bankruptcy protection,
spent $622,000 lobbying lawmakers and Gov. Gray Davis' administration during
the first three months of the year, according to reports filed with the state
Monday.
The reports show that seven energy companies spent more than $1 million
on lobbying as they ramped up their response to the crisis. Houston-based
power producer Reliant Energy, for example, spent nearly $100,000 on lobbying
firms through March 31--almost four times the $25,523 it spent during all of
last year.
The documents show that lobbyists for the firms were hard at work trying
to influence a horde of energy-related measures, from legislation to set new
rates for small power producers to a bill that put California in the
electricity purchasing business.
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said his company racked up hundreds of thousands
of dollars in expenses in its unsuccessful effort to reach an agreement with
the state on the purchase of its transmission lines. An unprecedented number
of energy-related bills added to PG&E's need to hire lobbyists, Low said.
"During the first quarter this year, more than 350 bills were introduced
in the Legislature that deal with the energy industry," Low said. "Almost all
those bills affected our customers and required staff analysis, testimony
before legislative committees, and questions to be answered for legislators
and their staff."
Sempra Energy, the parent firm of San Diego Gas & Electric, spent
$192,000 lobbying lawmakers in Sacramento and regulators at the Public
Utilities Commission, roughly half of what it spent all of last year.
The utility also made campaign contributions to political parties and
Sacramento politicians, giving $250 to Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, $750 each to
Assembly members Keith Richman (R-Northridge) and George Runner Jr.
(R-Lancaster) and $1,000 to Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City), among others.
A lobbying report for the parent company of Southern California Edison
was not available Monday evening. The reports were required to be filed both
electronically and by mail, postmarked by midnight Monday.
Electricity merchants and generators also boosted their spending. El
Paso Energy Corp., which owns one of the main natural gas pipelines into
California, spent nearly $22,000. It reported lobbying Davis' office and the
California Energy Commission.
Lobbyists hired by the company, according to the report, also spent $607
on dinners held in January and February with five lawmakers and an Assembly
staff member to discuss energy-related issues.
Assemblyman Roderick Wright, the Los Angeles Democrat who chairs the
Assembly's Utilities and Commerce Committee, dined with a lobbyist
representing El Paso on Feb. 21 at the Esquire Grill, a Sacramento
restaurant, according to the report. Assemblyman Joe Canciamilla
(D-Pittsburg), who heads a subcommittee exploring natural gas issues, also
ate at the Esquire on El Paso's tab that night.
The Houston-based power firm Dynegy Inc. spent $32,261 on lobbying
through March 31, compared to $24,000 during all of last year. Another
Houston energy company, electricity marketer Enron Corp., spent $66,994.
Duke Energy is among the firms paying top dollar for Sacramento
lobbyists as it seeks to build power plants in California to capitalize on
the state's energy shortage. The company reported spending more than $62,000
on lobbying through March 31--more than it spent all of last year.
"We would be remiss in not ensuring that our voice is heard in
Sacramento," said Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams, adding that his firm's
proposed Moss Landing power plant would provide "30% of the new generation
[of electricity] for the whole state of California in 2002."
"They're [lobbyists] not speaking for us, he added. "They're helping us
know exactly who to speak with to make sure we're appropriately heard--and
frankly, to ensure that we can get our power plants built."

Power Marketer Ordered by FERC to Refund $8 Million
Energy: Williams Energy agrees to pay but admits no wrongdoing in taking
plants offline.

By NANCY VOGEL and ROBERT J. LOPEZ, Times Staff Writers

In the first action of its kind during the California energy crisis,
federal regulators have ordered an out-of-state electricity marketer to
refund $8 million in connection with allegations that plants were improperly
shut down to hike power prices.
Tulsa-based Williams Energy Marketing & Trading has agreed to pay the
refund under an order issued Monday by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
The firm, which admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement agreement, was
probed for allegedly forcing utilities to pay higher prices by taking key
generating units in Long Beach and Huntington Beach offline in April and May
of last year.
Paula Hall-Collins, a Williams spokeswoman, said her company settled to
end the matter. She said that the company would have been exonerated had it
pursued the case.
"We decided to go ahead with the settlement in order to put it behind us
and move forward to more productive matters concerning California power
issues," she said.
While federal investigations of alleged overcharges by several firms are
continuing, Monday's order marked the first time a major power merchant has
been forced to pay back earnings since California forged into electricity
deregulation in 1996.
Critics and the state's independent grid operator have accused power
sellers of unjustly ratcheting up electricity prices in part by taking plants
offline.
In the case of Williams, the federal energy panel investigated the
shutdown of power plants that were obligated to provide electricity to the
state.
Desperate for power, California's grid operator had to turn to another
provider and pay as much $750 per megawatt-hour--more than 10 times the
normal price. The $8-million refund will go back to the grid operator.
Williams markets power produced at California plants owned by AES Corp.
of Arlington, Va.
Federal investigators probed the actions of both Williams and AES, but
the refund order affects only Williams. Initially, FERC had sought a refund
of about $10.8 million, but settled for $8 million in the compromise
agreement.
AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said the power plants in question were shut
down because of mechanical problems. He noted that his firm derived no profit
from the replacement power sold by Williams.
"We literally get paid to convert Williams' gas into Williams'
electricity, which they then sell into the marketplace," Thomas said. "We're
not paying any fines, and we didn't do anything wrong."

Davis Turns to Bankruptcy Court for Help in Plan to Buy Power Grid
Utility: He seeks support from panel representing creditors of PG&E. The firm
has rebuffed state's offers.

By DAN MORAIN and RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writers

SAN FRANCISCO--Foiled in his first attempt to buy Pacific Gas &
Electric's transmission grid, Gov. Gray Davis said Monday that he has tried a
new tactic: bypassing the company and attempting to build support for the
deal in Bankruptcy Court.
Davis' plan to buy the grid appeared to have ended disastrously last
month when the giant utility filed for bankruptcy protection. But Davis said
his advisors now are trying to sell the idea to a committee of PG&E creditors
that hold a stake in the utility's Chapter 11 proceeding.
The creditors committee, representing the hundreds of companies owed
money by PG&E, does not by itself hold the power to accept or reject the
deal, which Davis sees as a key to his plan to restructure the state's
crippled electricity system. But the committee will play an important role in
any reorganization plan that is ultimately hammered out in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court.
Given that power, Davis sent advisors to brief the committee last
Wednesday. The advisors told the committee about the deal they struck with
Southern California Edison to buy its share of the statewide transmission
grid, and the similar deal that PG&E rejected.
"I'm not saying they embraced it entirely," Davis said, after speaking
at a conference of technology entrepreneurs put on by the J.P. Morgan
investment bank. "But they liked parts of it, asked good questions, and I
thought it was a good beginning."
Paul Aronzon, the lead lawyer for the creditors committee, stressed that
the meeting with Davis' advisors would not lead directly to a deal. The
governor's representatives "did not come out and say, 'Would you guys sell us
the transmission grid?' " he said. Rather, Aronzon said, the advisors simply
brought the creditors up to speed on what Davis has put on the table.
Davis has offered more than $7 billion to buy the transmission systems
of Edison, San Diego Gas & Electric and PG&E. So far, only Edison has
accepted the deal. The cash infusion would help the utilities restructure
their debts, and ultimately relieve the state of the need to continue buying
electricity on their behalf.
The Davis administration made public Monday its most detailed breakdown
yet on the costs it expects to incur purchasing electricity over the next
years.
However, the extra information failed to satisfy Republican lawmakers,
who are holding up legislation needed to repay the state budget for the
billions already spent on electricity.
California will spend $15 billion buying power this year, according to
projections by Davis' advisors.
But that total will drop to $9 billion next year and $7 billion the next
as long-term electricity contracts, energy conservation efforts and new power
supplies combine to lower the state's costs.
With money from higher electric rates and a planned $12.5-billion bond,
the state should be able to cover the costs of power and operate at a surplus
starting in November 2002, the administration projected.
Several Republicans took note of the date: It is the month of the 2002
gubernatorial election, when Davis is expected to seek a second term.
The figures were based on a dizzying number of assumptions about the
state's energy future. The projections assume, for example, that Californians
will reduce energy consumption by 7%, and that 90% of the state's alternative
energy producers will soon generate electricity again. Now only about 65% are
online.
Davis administration officials defended the figures, saying that they
were conservative.
The reaction to the figures reflects a growing rift between Democrats
and Republicans over how best to solve the state's problems. Efforts have
been lurching unsteadily on several fronts, including the courts, the state
Legislature and Congress, with considerable political head-butting taking
place in the last two.
In Washington today, a key congressional panel is expected to take up
emergency legislation intended to help California, although Davis and other
Democrats have criticized the effort as useless.
The bill's 19 provisions would, among other things, provide federal aid
to relieve a bottleneck in the state's transmission system, permit governors
to obtain temporary waivers of environmental rules to boost power supplies,
and direct federal disaster officials to help California prepare for
blackouts.
A spokesman for Davis said the Republican-drafted legislation offers "a
lot of things we don't need, and fails to address the one thing we do need,"
namely firm price controls on wholesale electricity sales.
Democrats and Republicans have strong, fundamental disagreements about
how best to solve the crisis, with Democrats supporting price controls, if
only temporarily, and many Republicans, including President Bush, opposed to
tampering with the market.
Several Democrats who attended a White House ceremony Monday to mark
Bush's first 100 days in office spoke briefly to the president about the
energy situation.
"He was not very sympathetic," said Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), an
advocate of price controls. "They have their minds pretty well made up."
In one effort to seize the initiative, a divided state Senate
Appropriations Committee approved a bill Monday that would impose a windfall
profits tax on electricity sellers who gouge California consumers. Revenue
from the tax would flow back to Californians in the form of a credit on their
state income taxes, starting next April 15.
"Our backs are to the wall," said one sponsor of the bill, Sen. Jack
Scott (D-Altadena). "We believe that this is one time when we can stand up to
an avaricious energy generator and say, 'No more.' "
On a 7-3 vote, Democrats on the committee voted for the bill, SB1X, and
Republicans lined up against it. The measure moved to the Senate floor, where
it will require only a simple majority of 21 votes and is expected to pass.
Davis has said he is open to signing a windfall profits bill, but he has
not publicly lobbied for its passage.
Also Monday, legislation was introduced in the Assembly to bolster
natural gas supplies in the state. Tight supplies have led to soaring costs
for natural gas, the fuel most commonly used to generate electricity in
California.

Feds want surcharge to pay utilities' debts
THE PLAN: Additional rate boost likely, cash would go to power suppliers
Carolyn Said, Chronicle Staff Writer
Tuesday, May 1, 2001
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle
URL:
http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2001/05/01/MN9985.DTL
Federal energy regulators have proposed a surcharge on wholesale electricity
sales in California to compensate generating companies, angering state
officials who say the idea amounts to gouging consumers.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission suggested collecting the money to
reimburse electricity suppliers who have debts from Pacific Gas and Electric
Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co. Power
companies accrued some $6 billion in unpaid bills from California's
struggling utilities in late 2000 and early this year, until the state
stepped in to take over the purchasing of power.
"Under the pretense of helping California, (FERC) is proposing to steal
additional money from California ratepayers to pad the pockets of the greedy
energy companies," Gov. Gray Davis said in a statement. "FERC does not care
one wit about the ratepayer. Their plan is a total capitulation to the energy
companies."
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., who has been an outspoken critic of FERC's
policies in California, said the surcharge would "ensure that power
generators get paid fully for their price gouging. That is outrageous and
will further alienate Californians."
The surcharge presumably would be levied on the California Department of
Water Resources, which, as the state's purchasing agent, has already spent
more than $5 billion on power since January. The DWR's costs, in turn, are
likely to be borne by California's consumers and taxpayers.
FERC would require the California Independent System Operator, which runs the
state's power grid, to collect the surcharge. But state regulators could
challenge the surcharge.
"We have 30 days to comment to FERC and are considering our options," said
Sean Gallagher, state counsel at the California Public Utilities Commission.
"If (FERC's) concern is public policy and maintaining just and reasonable
prices for consumers, I don't quite understand why they would get into the
middle of a legal wrangle about past bills' getting paid," said Severin
Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy Institute in
Berkeley. "It is true the firms would like to get paid. I'm not sure what
FERC has to do with helping them collect their money."
A 'GOUGING TAX'
Consumer advocates characterized the surcharge as a "gouging tax" that
underscores the Bush administration's close ties to energy firms, many of
which are based in President Bush's home state of Texas.
"This is evidence that FERC and the administration are more interested in
protecting the energy industry than the consumers or taxpayers of
California," said Doug Heller, a consumer advocate with the Los Angeles-based
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "It's back-billing us to pay
prices that were unjust and unreasonable per the FERC's own analysis."
FERC's Curt Hebert, a Mississippi Republican whom President Bush appointed
chairman of the commission, was behind the surcharge proposal, which he told
the Wall Street Journal was a way "to stabilize the market." Hebert did not
return calls for comment.
The surcharge was proposed in FERC's 39-page "mitigation" plan to alleviate
wholesale electricity prices in California during power emergencies; the plan
was released last week. FERC said it would accept public comment on the
proposal for 30 days, after which it would decide whether to implement it.
COMPLICATED ISSUES
Even the power industry, the presumptive beneficiary of the surcharge, did
not express whole-hearted support for it.
"I'm glad they brought it up," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the
Western Power Trading Forum, which represents all major buyers and sellers of
wholesale electricity in California. "But it skirts the issue of what's state
regulated and what's federally regulated. I'm not sure how federal regulators
can pass a charge on wholesale costs which then ends up on consumers, without
the state saying it's OK."
Some of the proposal's wording is unclear. It discusses, for example, whether
the surcharge money "should cover all past-due amounts or only future unpaid
bills starting from the date the plan is begun."
The reference to "future unpaid bills" is puzzling since, with the state of
California picking up the tab, electricity suppliers no longer are
accumulating unpaid bills from the utilities.
"That could become a self-fulfilling prophecy; we don't want to go there,"
Ackerman said about the idea of "future unpaid bills."
The FERC proposal also implies that electricity generators have reduced
production in California, an allegation the power companies themselves deny.
FERC asked for comments on whether the surcharge "would help to increase
production by creating a greater assurance that generators will be paid."

Lawmakers offer bills aimed at cutting natural gas prices
JENNIFER COLEMAN, Associated Press Writer
Tuesday, May 1, 2001
,2001 Associated Press

949EDT0128.DTL&type=news
(05-01) 06:49 PDT SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis is relying on stringent
conservation measures, increased electricity supply and quick Legislative
authority to proceed with a $12.5 billion revenue bond issue to head off
blackouts this summer.
Davis administration officials briefed lawmakers Monday on the governor's
plan to rescue Southern California Edison by buying the utility's
transmission lines.
The extra financial details Davis' representatives gave Assembly Republicans
include forecasts of the Department of Water Resources' summer power
purchases -- the same figures the state will use to find buyers for $12.5
billion in bonds to pay for future power.
Those forecasts, some Republicans said, count on too many things falling into
place, including the assumption that all of the state's financially troubled
alternative energy producers will be online.
Though energy analysts have predicted skyrocketing energy costs for summer --
up to $1,500 per megawatt hour -- the governor's plan calculates an average
cost of $195 per megawatt hour over June, July and August.
That's because DWR cut long-term contracts covering a major part of the
electricity needed during peak times, said Ron Nichols, senior managing
director for Navigant Consulting Inc.
Long-term contracts and conservation will minimize the effect of the expected
high spot prices, Nichols said.
In essence, Davis aides, much of the conservation will be spurred by sticker
shock felt by consumers when they get their higher rates on their June bills.
PG&E customers will see a 34 percent increase, Southern California Edison's
will jump 32 and San Diego Gas and Electric rates will jump 44 percent.
Davis' consultants predict the state can conserve up to 7,234 megawatts
during peak demand -- about 16 percent of a 45,000 megawatt load that summer
weather can bring on. One megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes.
Much of that conservation, 2,484 megawatts, will come from three different
conservation programs through the California Independent System Operator,
keeper of the state's power grid.
Davis' ''20/20'' conservation plan is expected to cut another 2,200 megawatts
of demand. The rest of the cuts come from the sticker shock of higher
consumer rates and by estimating how much less power Californians are using
this year compared to last year.
``If we're wrong, there are certain reserves built in,'' said Susan Kennedy,
deputy chief of staff and secretary of cabinet. Either the state borrows more
or there will be blackouts, she added, and if the price of power goes higher
than expectations, the state won't be able to afford it.
By the end of 2002, Davis estimates, DWR will spend $26.9 billion to buy
power for customers of the three financially ailing utilities. Of that, $12.5
billion will be paid for by revenue bonds that will add up to one cent per
kilowatt hour to customer bills for 15 years.
The Legislature approved the revenue bonds based on a formula that would set
the amount of the issue. Now Davis' representatives say it's urgent that the
Legislature approve a bill with a firm cap so they could begin the bond sale.
``We need the unambiguous authority to sell bonds. We need it right now. We
cannot afford any delays,'' Kennedy said.
A bill putting a $10 billion limit on the bonds stalled in the Assembly last
week after Republicans refused to vote for it until they received more
details about Davis' power buys and long-term contracts.
Republicans wondered about the ability of the alternative generators to be
online, a sentiment shared by the industry. Currently, about one-third are
off-line now because PG&E and Edison owe them more than $1 billion.
The Public Utilities Commission ordered the utilities to pay those generators
every other week starting April 1, but the large debts have the generators
fighting to stay open, said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the
Independent Energy Producers.
Davis' predictions aren't rosy, but realistic, said Joseph Fichera, a
financial adviser for the governor. ``It minimizes the risk of blackouts, but
you can never eliminate it.''
Also Monday, an Assembly subcommittee unveiled four bills Monday designed to
increase supplies of natural gas, including streamlining approvals for gas
storage and new pipelines.
After conducting hearings on the market, the subcommittee is recommending the
state streamline the PUC's process to approve underground natural gas storage
facilities and new pipelines, allow lower-grade California natural gas to be
used by industrial users and reform tariffs to see if they discourage
investments in a variety of natural gas-related ventures.
Meanwhile, the state remained free of power alerts Tuesday morning as
reserves stayed above 7 percent.
On the Net:
The bill numbers are: AB78x by Canciamilla; AB73x by Canciamilla and
Dickerson; AB23x, by Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Atwater, and Assemblywoman
Barbara Matthews, D-Tracy; and AB42x, by Diaz.

, , -- (05-01) 06:46 PDT Developments in California's energy crisis:
^TUESDAY:<
-- An Assembly electricity oversight committee releases report on its
investigation of alleged natural gas price and supply manipulation.
-- The state remains free of power alerts as electricity reserves stay above
7 percent.
^MONDAY:<
-- Gov. Gray Davis' staff briefs Assembly Republicans on the plan to purchase
Southern California Edison's transmission lines. The governor estimates that
during peak hours this summer, Californians can conserve more than 7,000
megawatts. That's enough power for more than 5 million homes. Davis' advisers
say the Legislature needs to quickly approve a bill that would let the state
issue bonds to buy power for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric, San Diego
Gas and Electric and Edison. The bonds would also repay the general fund for
the more than $5 billion the state has already spent on power.
-- PG&E's transmission lines could still be bought by the state despite the
utility seeking bankruptcy protection when an earlier deal with state
negotiators fell through, Davis says. Davis tells reporters that a creditors
committee of businesses owed money by PG&E asked the state for a briefing on
talks to buy San Diego Gas and Electric Co.'s transmission lines. Davis says
he believes there is still some possibility of buying PG&E's lines.
-- Williams Energy agrees to pay $8 million to settle charges by federal
regulators that the company withheld power to drive up prices.
``We decided to settle to put this behind us and to put our full attention
toward more productive matters in relation to California versus going through
a costly and long hearing process,'' said Williams spokeswoman Paula
Hall-Collins. She said Williams ``is confident that a full hearing of the
facts would have exonerated us entirely.''
-- Members of the Assembly Subcommittee on Natural Gas Costs and Availability
unveil legislation to cut natural gas prices.
-- The state Assembly approves a bill that lets a private energy company
purchase a shuttered PG&E power plant. The North American Power Group plans
to reopen the Kern Power Plant that PG&E shut down in 1985. Once renovated,
it will provide enough electricity about 180,000 homes. The bill moves to the
Senate.
-- The state remains free of power alerts as electricity reserves stay above
7 percent.
<
WHAT'S NEXT:<
-- Davis' representatives continue negotiating with Sempra, the parent
company of San Diego Gas and Electric Co., to buy the utility's transmission
lines.
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's
electricity crisis.
Edison and PG&E say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June to high
wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from
passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs
from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection
April 6.
Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the two companies' poor
credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to
start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and
business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned
utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than
much larger Edison and PG&E but also struggling with high wholesale power
costs.
The Public Utilities Commission has raised rates as much as 46 percent to
help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.

Second try for tax cut in Oakland
Smaller utility levy likely after Brown veto
Tyche Hendricks, Chronicle Staff Writer
Tuesday, May 1, 2001
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2001/05/01/M
NE216500.DTL&type=news
Oakland -- The Oakland City Council is set to scale back plans for a
six-month cut in the city's utility users tax in the face of a first-ever
veto by Mayor Jerry Brown, who said the city may not be able to afford the
cut.
A week after the council voted 5 to 2 to give residents relief on their
skyrocketing gas and electric bills by reducing the tax the city imposes,
council members said yesterday that they will reconsider the plan and may
give a break only to the poorest Oaklanders.
City Council President Ignacio De La Fuente, the author of the tax cut
proposal, said he plans to revise the measure at tonight's council meeting.
Under the revision, low-income residents would be exempt from the tax, which
could cost the city an estimated $300,000.
"The mayor has some legitimate concerns," De La Fuente said. He said he would
postpone consideration of a cut for all residents until after the state has
approved its budget for the coming year.
The council's latest move came after Brown last week invoked his authority to
block legislation, a power he was granted under the 1998 strong-mayor
ordinance that he wrote and voters approved.
In the letter, Brown said the six-month tax break would take $1.6 million
from the city coffers and could be construed as a permanent tax cut, which
under state Proposition 218 would require approval by two-thirds of the
voters to reinstate.
"In addition," the mayor wrote, "the current budget hemorrhaging in
Sacramento threatens to reduce expected state revenues to the city on which
the current city budget is based." Brown said he would support relief for
those least able to pay.
The council had planned to temporarily reduce the city's utility tax from 7.
5 percent to roughly 6 percent for most residents and eliminate it entirely
for low-income households that qualify for PG&E's assistance program.
After the council approved the tax cut last week, city leaders heard a report
from the city manager's budget analyst confirming that state money for
California's cities might be reduced for the next fiscal year.
"We all wanted to do this," said Councilwoman Jane Brunner, referring to
herself and four other council members, including De La Fuente, who voted for
the utility tax relief.
"But they are saying that the (state's) energy costs may dip into some of the
regular general fund money (for city and county governments). And that may be
very significant."
Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, who voted against the tax cut along with Dick
Spees, said tax relief for low-income residents would cost the city roughly
$300,000, which she called a more reasonable figure. The eighth council
position was vacant last week but will be filled tonight when council member-
elect Moses Mayne is sworn in.
Brown's action marks the first time he has exercised his law-blocking power
under Measure X, which allows the mayor to send new legislation back to the
council for reconsideration if it is passed with fewer than six votes.
If the council cannot muster six votes on its second review, the law would
not take effect.
Russo said the fact that Brown has not used his veto power until now, more
than halfway into his four-year term, shows that he is able to work with the
council.
"I think it's significant that this is first time (he's used the veto)," said
Russo. "It has been 2 1/2 years of some pretty contr
