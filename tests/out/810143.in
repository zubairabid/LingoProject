The January check just arrived at Chantilly. Kathy is fedexing it directly to
Cash Management for morning delivery.  The late receipt is due to the fact
that
it was addressed to the old Fairfax office and not to the Irvine CA address
requested on the invoice.   I just spoke to Robin Barbe (who checked with
their
accounting staff) and understand that Enron feels that the effort to stop the
check, and immediately execute a wire transfer would not be productive.
