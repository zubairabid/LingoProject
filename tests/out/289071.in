Hi Mark;   Thank you for the comments on Macedonia.  I take it you have
started your book since you said "Details will be in the book!"
Not much new here most excitement is about a May 5 Wedding!!
The White Sox are having a slow start with a 4-7 record and neither the
hitting or pitching very good.  However the season is young ---- I hope.
What makes even worse is that the Cubs are on top of their division with a
8-4 record.
The weather has improved though we had snow showers yesterday.  A good
thing you are not going to Canada this year.
Mother and I send LOTS of LOVE and KISSES     DAD
