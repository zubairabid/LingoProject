Attached is a memo outlining my concerns in ENA entering into the above-referenced agreement.  I will forward to you a hard copy of the Water Code that I reference in my memo.  Please do not forward this memo to CDWR or their consultant.  I can prepare a version suitable for distribution to CDWR if you would like.
