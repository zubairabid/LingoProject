Please talk up the Senior High Night Out this  Wednesday.It is this Friday
night from 9:30pm-2:30 am, with bowling,  broomball, and other stuff! The
cost is $20.

Even though the kids will have their own events  before and after broomball,
they will be expecting theirNEON leaders for  the broomball portion of the
evening. We need to show up at the Aerodrome  shortly after 11:00, and we'll
have the ice from 11:15-12:15.After  that we'll go home and the kids will
go on to other stuff till 2:30!

See you at the Aerodrome.
