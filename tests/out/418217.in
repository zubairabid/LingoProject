This should help clarify a lot of things, thanks Tana for the Certificate of
assumed name.
The receipt of the assumed name certificate from the State of Illinois proves
that Northern Ilinois Gas Company is an active Corporation (set up in GCP as
a HQ company) with Nicor Gas Company as their assumed name (Set up in GCP as
a tradename). Seems like in Global Counterparty both the counterparties are
set up exactly the way it should be. The request below is to change the
tradename's name from Nicor Gas Company to Northen Ilinois Gas Company dba
Nicor Gas Company, which I don't have any documentation or instructions for.
Upon my conversation with Sandy Allison, Attorney Nicor Gas at Ph (630)
983-8676 x2882 all the contracts and legal binding documents should carry the
name Nicor Gas Company, and so does the Assumed Name Certificate says. In
addition, Marcia Nawrocki, Attorney Nicor Gas on her fax cover sheet attached
with the Certificate, instructed to "use NICOR GAS COMANY".
In lieu of the above facts, Global Counterparty does not feel necessary to
make any changes in its database.
Regards!
