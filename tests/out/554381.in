PGL and North Shore converted part of their index supply deal into a nymex
fix price (basis is still floating).  Please amend the existing supply deal
to reflect this change and confirm the supply contract ammendment as we
discussed.  Feel free to call me if you have any questions.
PGL 6/01-10/02     5000 mmbtu/d 4.48 Nymex only
NS 6/01-10/02    1250 mmbtu/d 4.48  Nymex only
