Our efforts with the Governors have been productive from a GA standpoint and may be prove fruitful from a business develop standpoint as well.  Given FERC's issuance of their price cap order, Sue, Scott and I have been reviewing various options for staying relevant to the Governors.

We submit that we can stay relevant to the Governors and continue to provide positive value to our national efforts by moving our message from "neither price caps nor balkanization shall you support," to

we need RTO West and Desert Star now--i.e., set some deadlines FERC
long-term portfolio management is a good thing
core/noncore is a reasonable risk management tool
there are certain provisions of the "Democratic" energy plan and the Bush plan that we can all support--see below.

We've scheduled meetings with Gov. Leavitt's office in mid-July and will begin our outreach to Gov. Kitzhapper and Gov. Locke after we discuss the above.    If interested, I'll ask Lysa to set up a conference call to discuss.
