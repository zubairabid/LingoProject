I just talked with Mark Walton x34864 (He is working Debbie Moseley's account in her absence - she is expected to return tomorrow) and he now understands the issue.  Since we have been billing ONEOK based upon water tickets left by the truck driver (rather than the revenue statement ONEOK receives for it's condensate like we use at all other points), I think they want to see where our gallons came from.  I believe the field has been faxing the water tickets to Debbie and she has been basing her invoice on them.  Mark will look into what we have been using today and will let me know.  He with also talk to their accounting to determine if they just want this data for after the fact backup or if they are holding up payment.
