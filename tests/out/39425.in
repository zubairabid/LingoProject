Attached is the April 2001 Assignment, Termination & Expiration Report for Houston Pipe Line's contracts.  (FYI - It contains all of the entries made by our group since the report was last done on 3/8/01, regardless of the effective date.)  If you do not need to receive this report or if you know of someone else that should receive it, please let me know by e-mail or phone (x-36982) so that I can either remove your name from or add their name to the distribution list.
