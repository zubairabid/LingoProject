Howard-- I strongly disagree with your conclusions about the retention of the
Greenberg firm on the commandeering litigation. When we originally hired
Greenberg, we heard from their litigation and bankruptcy counsel for 30
minutes--5 minutes on their inverse condemnation experience.. Some in the
group thought that they were the right choice over, for example, Andrews &
Kurth, because the issues in the the Px bankruptcy would be more focused at
the courthouse than at FERC. I clearly think we made the right call in this
regard. However at the time we made the choice, I made the comment, which I
am sure all of you remember, that if we were going to choose litigation
counsel we should go out and hire the absolute best counsel for the job. If
that happened to be Greenberg firm---great---but they would have to interview
like the rest. The fact that they have done research doesn't mean they get
the job. That research is transferable.This is a billion dollar issue for the
group. Enron does not hire attys for cases of that magnitude unless we are
absolutely sure they are the best there is. I have talked to the attys for
both Mirant and Reliant and they agree with my position. I think we need to
talk about this at length.
