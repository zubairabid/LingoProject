I  wanted to recap the discussions the settlement parties had regarding the
preparation of testimony that is currently scheduled to be filed on May  5.
The format will be based on the "hub and spoke" concept we  discussed
earlier: SoCalGas will file testimony focusing on the mechanics of  capacity
and retail unbundling, including a discussion of risk sharing,  illustrative
rate impacts and evidence that the settlement is in the public  interest.
The other settlement parties will filetestimony from the  perspective on
what the settlement means to their clients and why the settlement  is in the
public interest. Parties have also agreed to prepare  declarations for the
settlement to be filed on April 17, drafts which must be  circulated prior to
the 3PM conference call scheduled for Thursday  afternoon.

The  tentative assignment of testimony preparation responsibilitiesare
identified as follows:

SoCalGasMechanics  of Capacity and Retail
Unbundling(separatetestimony for  capacity and retail)
WGS/WHP/Enron  Transmission, Storage and Balancing Unbundling
Edison/Calpine/DynegyPricing  and Benefits to Electric Generators
Edison/EnronConcepts  of Unbundling (Paul Carpenter as
Industry Expert)
ORA  Unbundling Policy and Core Impacts
TXU/ShellCore  Interstate Capacity Unbundling
Transwestern  Primary and Secondary Receipt Point Access

CalpineMetering  Program

The  parties also agreed that we need to counter the lobbying impacts of
TURN/SCGC,  who have been making the rounds on the 5th floor and suggesting
that industry  restructuring is no longer necessary and harms customers in
southern  California. If I have missed something, please let me know. I
would  also like to discuss with the parties on Thursday a schedule for
review and  comment on the prepared testimonies. I suggest that we try and
get our  first drafts out no later than April 24. Let me know what you
think.
