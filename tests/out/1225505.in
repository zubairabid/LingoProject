Kenton,
You are correct about my meeting with Bill Muckle (
Broadwing's Director of OSP Eng & Constr.)  in Rock Springs Monday and
Tuesday of next week.
They will have ten of their key field people there and we will have four of
our key servillance people, including Bill and Paul Beamis.  We will go over
accepatble construction and escalation procedures.  They are being  much more
careful than they have been in the past, even changing sides of the road in
tight right-of-way areas.  I'll update you after the meeting.
