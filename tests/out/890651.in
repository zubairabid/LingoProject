In order to document the termination extension, Peoples will be preparing a bilateral agreement for Laura's execution.  They prefer a bilateral agreement because they feel that if they unilaterally extend the termination they may erode their position relevant to a termination at a later date.  Jeff - without seeing the agreement, I am assuming that this works in form.  Let me know if this is correct.  I am expecting the agreement to be sent to Laura this evening.  If I receive a copy prior to that time, I will send it on for your review.

Thanks - Gregg
