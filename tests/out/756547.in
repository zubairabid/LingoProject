Gentlemen;
For your perusal and comments is a memo outlining the issues raised by the National Energy Board with respect to TransCanada PipeLines Ltd's 2001 and 2002 Tolls application and their relevance to Enron.
I would be pleased to schedule a time to meet with you to discuss the implications to Enron. Alternatively, you could call me at 6747 or email your comments.
Thanks,
