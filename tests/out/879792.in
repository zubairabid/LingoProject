i told dehart to get ahold of me at my parents place.  i think he
called, but i didn't get the message until sunday.  you guys are all
welcome to stay at my house.  i am sure my parents would love to see you
guys again.  i am sure my parents will wonder why a bunch of old, fat,
and bald 30 year olds are staying at their house instead of a hotel.  as
for robie, we can give him a blanket and he can sleep out in the side
cart of his dirt bike.  when is this trip?
