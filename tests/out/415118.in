In response to your email:

1.  The NYMEX did not have Dana Davis down as a user because he just
completed and signed his application Wednesday evening and the NYMEX received
the application by Fedex Thursday.  It will take several days for them to
process his application.  Further, he still needs to attend their training
session in NY (I hope this coming Wednesday) before he will be able to trade
online.

2.  As far as the problem with only one user being able to get in NYMEX
ACCESS at a time.  I have a call into the NYMEX about this.  We get a
terminal per seat, so since we have two seats, we get two terminals at no
cost.  The 3 additional terminals have to be leased from other NYMEX members
and the NYMEX is arranging the initial lease for us and will pay the lease,
cost free for the first 6 months.  After 6 months any cost associated with
the 3 additonal terminals will have to be borne by ENA.  I have a call into
the NYMEX to find out what the status of our 3 leases is.

3.  Bruce, per your voicemail about you or a member of your group having the
ability to change operator access to these terminals, changes in the terminal
operator approvals can only be done by the two seatholders, who are currently
Mark Haedicke and Kevin Hannon.  Any changes with respect to operators will
have to be done by full application to the NYMEX, therefore, such process
should continue to be done through the Legal Department.
