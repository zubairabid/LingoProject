Michael,

Here is the Northern Border Pipeline draft stipulation that ENA is planning to present to the BTRC.  It incorporates the flexibility and features that Enron Canada needs to complete settlements that are in the works with a couple of former netback producers, Birchill and Tenaska.  It also has backup disposition plans for ENA's Northern Border capacity in the event that the Enron Canada deals fall apart.  With respect to future claims, NBPL's posting of the capacity on their website is just another way to find creditworthy shippers that can step into ENA's shoes for the remaining terms of the firm max rate transport agreements.
