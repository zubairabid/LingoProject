Mitch - DeDe and I are each arriving the prior night, so we can begin  early. I have not heard back from others as to when their plances arrive, so I  suggested 10:30 in my original e-mail on this.  But subject to plane  schedules, the earlier the better.
If I remember correctly, AEP uses business casual dress. Is that  appropriate for this meeting?  Your call, Mitch.
