Dale, since Okaloosa turned back all of their FTS-1 capacity for April and October effective at the in-service date of Phase IV their NNTS of 500/day for these two months must also be taken to zero.

Please take the NNT volume of 500/day off Okaloosa's K#5986.  Please send them an amendment to reflect the change.

Thanks.
