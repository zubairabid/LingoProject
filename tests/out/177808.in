Here's the proposal to form the Team.
Note that the complete team list includes:
&The MRT will be led by Philippe Auclair, and will include Market Participant
Advisor (MPA),
Eric Woychik, Market Assessment Advisor (MAA), Steven Stoft, and any others
appointed by the
Board.
&The Market Design Group may be comprised of a number of national experts on
energy
market structure and regulation, and to be used as needed by the MRT. Severin
Borenstein,
Joe Bowering (PJM,s Market Monitor), William Hogan, Paul Joskow, and Frank
Wolak have all
expressed their willingness to assist the ISO Board through the Market Repair
Team.8
Does anybody have a read on Bowering from PJM?
