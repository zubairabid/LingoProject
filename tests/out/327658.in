Being as the below Sections 10.3.2 (e) and (g) were negotiated for a full
Power Island supply with testing requirements very different from a GTG
purchase contract's usual testing requirements, which aslo resulted in the
agreement to expand the definition of the Commissioning Period to include all
of the "Acceptanc Tests", I do not think that the below sections should be
addressed or included in the World Hunger discussions.  The preceding was
GE's arguement for their change in the first place.  There is a world of
difference between a 30 day commissioning period for a simple cycle unit and
26 weeks for a power island like we have for Arcos.  Apples and oranges
applies here.
