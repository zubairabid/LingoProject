Attached are filings made this week at FERC to seek permission for EPMI and
EES to make certain FERC-required filings (including quarterly power marketer
filings) on behalf of industrials with on site generation that sell power
into the grid to us.  The filings will allow Enron to make it easier for
these industrials to sell to us from their administrative filing viewpoint.
We expect to receive authorization within 60 days.
Generally, industrials with on site generation are required to obtain a FERC
power marketer license and comply with FERC's reporting requirements, similar
to EPMI and EES' FERC filing requirements.  EPMI and EES will be able to file
specific industrial purchases in a combined report, rather than requiring the
industrials to file their separate reports with FERC.
