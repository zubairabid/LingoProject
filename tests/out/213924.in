The Capacity Auction Agreement Working Group for ERCOT (CAAWG - ERCOT) will
be the forum to work on the implementation of the standard form agreement and
resolution of issues related to using capacity auction products in the
ancillary services markets of ERCOT. The CAAWG - ERCOT will hold its meetings
at the Commission where a member of the Commission's Market Oversight
Division will be present.  This group will be filing its final work product
in Central Records at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001, for public comment prior
to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001 Open Meeting.

The SPP Stakeholders will be filing a standard form agreement and resolution
of issues related to the use of capacity auction products in the SPP
ancillary services markets at the Commission at 3 pm on Friday, May 4, 2001
for public comment prior to consideration at the Commission's June 14, 2001
Open Meeting. Because the structure of the SPP ancillary services market is
still under development, the focus will be on ERCOT and input and assistance
from SPP staff will be sought in the coming weeks.

The Working Groups are a direct result of the PUCT Capacity Auction Order.
The current time line proposes meeting weekly as Stakeholders to work to
resolve the issues, schedules and final products to be included in the
auction this fall.  Under the current proposal the Capacity Auction Products
will be Baseline, Gas Intermediate, Gas Cyclic and Gas Peaking.  Each of the
PGCs must auction 15% of the Texas Jurisdictional Installed Generation
Capacity.  The capacity will be sold as a "slice of the system" of each of
the divesting PGCs and will not be for any specific unit.  During the months
of March, April May, October, and November of each year the available
entitlements may be reduced proportionately to the average planned plant
outage.  With respect to the firmness of the products, the PUCT found that
the products should be 100% financially firm to provide potential buyers of
the entitlements certainty in the products that they are buying.  Forced
outages are limited to 2.0% of the hours of the entitlement.

The Power Generation Companies (PGCs)  have recommended using the EEI Master
Power Purchase and Sale Agreement and Schedule CA will describe the products
available for auction.  A copy of Schedule CA will be attached below for your
review and comment.  Please note that the Schedule CA is not a final document
and is an initial proposal from the PGCs.  Your review and comments will be
essential.  Also, if you have any questions or comments as to the process of
the CAAWG or the auction process in general please feel free to call me.  The
working group will meet each Wednesday for the balance of April after which
the working group will meet May 1st and May 2nd in anticipation of the
proposed May 4th filing date.  After the filing, Enron will have the
opportunity to file written comments with the PUCT.  The Auction process
under the rule must be completed prior to September 1, 2001 for the initial
auction period.

The following is an initial list of issues.

1. What is the timing of schedules for each of the products from the buyer of
the entitlement to the seller of the entitlement.
2. Are ancillary services available from the Baseload product?  TXU has
stated that they cannot provide A/S from their Baseload units.  As   such,
should A/S be removed from all Baseload product offerings from all PGCs so
that there is a standard product or should the Baseload   offerings include
ancillary services when and where available.  The argument distills to if the
entitlement is more valuable in the market as a   standardized product or a
differentiated product that may or may not include A/S.
3. What is the delivery point for the entitlement and other operational
issues?  Should it be a single bus, multiple busses or congestion zones.
Congestion zones may change each year, under the current auction schedule,
you would bid for the product before you know the final congestion  zone.
4. How (or if possible) can responsibility transfers be used for balancing
energy?
5. Who will receive OOM payments?
6. What about compensation for other A/S payments?
7. Does released capacity exist, should it exist at all?  If so, what happens
when the capacity is released.  The PGC would like the offering to look like
a call option.  If the option is not exercised by scheduling, then the
capacity is deemed released.  This is the interpretation of the PGC,s and
not   necessarily that of the PUCT or other Stakeholders.
8. How much of a product or entitlement is available in A/S?

rule starts at page 41 of 65.
