The hardest part of preparing the Long Descriptions is making sure all of the
terms used in th GTC's that need to be defined elsewhere are covered.  I'll
have to leave the final determination to the people who drafted the GTC's.  I
also have to point out I don't know much of anything about how bandwidth is
traded, but here are the comments I was able to come up with to the Long
Descriptions:
Bandwidth Units - This concept has been difficult for me - it's not entirely
clear to me where the definition of this comes from - is it the reference in
the box at the top of the relevant Annex?  If so, maybe we should add a line
something to the effect of 'Bandwidth Units shall mean DS-3 for this
Transaction.'  Or better yet you might consider a generic reference to the
relevant Annex that should apply which might let you delete the sentence
referring to the quality as well.
Does 'DSO' need to be defined somewhere?
The way the different Price definitions fit together has also eluded me -
there is a formula in the Long Description and a different formula in the
GTC.  Unless industry trading convention is to the contrary, the site makes
more intuitive sense when the volume quoted and the price quoted use the same
units.  If the volume is Bandwidth Units and the price is a per mile number
some counterparties (or perhaps more likely their lawyers) may be confused.
The GTC contains the defined term 'Unit Price' which is in $/Bandwidth Unit.
It seems to me that if we can quote the price as the Unit Price and the
volume as Bandwidth Units, we can ignore the number of DSO's per Bandwidth
Unit and the number of DSO miles for the transaction.
Since they won't change from one product to the next, the two sentences
beginning with 'Any party entering into a Transaction...' could be moved to
the GTC.
The term 'Contractual Currency' is not used int he GTC.  Can the
parenthetical reference come out?  (The EnronOnline people may care about
this more than I.)
If the numbers of miles and DSO's need to stay in the Long Descriptions, I
would suggest that you change the references to make it DSO's per Bandwidth
Unit (both where the number is introduced and in the price formula) and that
the unt of measure against which the price is quoted be 'per DSO mile per
month'.
Is the volume on the quotes page a monthly or total number?  This needs to be
clear from the Long Description.
So for example, if you follow all of my suggestions, you might end up with
something like this:
A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (&EBS8)
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantity
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website.  The price
shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the
General Terms and Conditions shall apply to this Transaction.
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effective
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination
Date>.
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:
LSAJCAWZH04).
The price is quoted in US Dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one Bandwidth Unit
per month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per
month.
If quoting the price as a per Bandwidth Unit number doesn't work it would be
more like this:
A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. (&EBS8)
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantity
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of
DSO,s per Bandwidth Unit is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the
Counterparty via the Website.  Annex A-1 of the General Terms and Conditions
will apply to this Transaction.
The term of the Transaction shall begin at 12:00 a.m. (EST) on the Effective
Date and continue to 11:59:59 p.m. (EST) on the Termination Date. The
Effective Date is <Start Date> and the Termination Date is <Termination
Date>.
The Transaction shall be for Bandwidth between the New York Market Pooling
Point (111 8th Avenue, Suite 1517, New York, NY 10011, NPA-NXX: 212-462,
CLLI: NYCMNY83H62) and the Los Angeles Market Pooling Point (530 W. 6th
Street, Suite 300, Los Angeles, CA 90014, NPA-NXX: 213-362, CLLI:
LSAJCAWZH04), for a total of 2,446 DSO miles.
The price is quoted in US Dollars.
The unit of measure against which the price is quoted is one DS0 mile per
month and the quantity shown shall be in number of Bandwidth Units per month.
Therefore, the Contract Price will be calculated as follows: price x the
number of DS0,s per Bandwidth Unit x the number of DS0 miles x the number of
Bandwidth Units.
Please let me know if you have any questions - I will go ahead and approve
the product in the system so you can proceed without me if necessary.
