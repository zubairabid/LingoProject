** - GENERAL MOTORS TO AXE THOUSANDS OF EUROPEAN JOBS: General Motors
recently informed union leaders that it would be making thousands of job
cuts in the coming weeks as the automaker has made plans to reduce
production by 15%. The news of planned job cuts comes amidst concern that
the slowing worldwide economy coupled with the effects of the U.S. terrorist
attacks will result in weakened consumer confidence which would further harm
the European auto market. Many European automakers have announced similar
production and workforce cutbacks in reaction to the terrorist attacks. See

** - FIAT LAYS-OFF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS AFTER TERRORIST ATTACKS: European
automaker Fiat recently announced plans to reduce auto production by 30,000
cars and lay-off 20,000 employees in reaction to the terrorist attacks in
the U.S. The attacks have caused many companies, including automakers, to
scale back their production plans in anticipation of a dramatic drop in
demand for cars. Fiat announced that it will be cutting 700 jobs in Poland
alone, amounting to approximately 10% of its Polish workforce, after
estimates showed that auto demand in Europe will drop between 5% to 8%
during the final quarter of 2001. Laid-off workers have been assured that
they will receive 80% of their salaries. See " Fiat Lays-Off

RESOLUTION: The European Parliament recently issued an important report on
e-commerce and financial services. While this report primarily addresses
issues arising from consumer contracts in the financial services industry,
the study embraces a concept that could have a significant impact on
cross-border employment issues. The report discusses the European
Extra-Judicial Network for the resolution of cross-border disputes. The
report also expresses support for the use of ADR systems, both on and off
line to resolve cross-border disputes.
