At or before the May 16th meeting in Hicksville, there is some basic
information that is needed for marketers to determine their regulatory risk
in accepting capacity from KeySpan East and West. KeySpan must provide , in
detail, for all transportation contracts (East and West) the following
information:

- Max. Daily Quantity
- Telescoping (Receipt and Delivery Points/ Amounts available at
different delivery points)
- Rate Schedules
- Pipeline
- Start Date
- End Date
- Current Rates (Demand, Variable, Fuel %, Surcharges)
- Any proposed pipeline rate changes that take effect in the next
year (effective Date)
- Map the gas flow of contracts, if transportation feeds into other
transportation contracts.
- Identify contracts used for storage W/D or Inj.
- Identify historical (past 24 months) geographic basis differential
to the NYMEX for each receipt point on the different transportation
contracts

KeySpan should explain the contractual and operational restrictions for not
releasing a slice of the system. The percentage of secondary delivery
capacity needs to be defined and KeySpan should inform marketers of any
preliminary negations for incremental purchases and the pricing terms to
serve the firm market.
