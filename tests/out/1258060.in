Learned of an opp today for a L.T. physical toll on a peaking plant in PJM.  Probably way too early for this, but we may be able to follow this one and act when we're further along.  Here are the details:

Plant is being developed by PPL - consists of 10 LM 6000's, due online by May 03 (~450 MW).  turbines will be on site shortly w/ construction due to start in April
PPL has entered an LOI to sell the completed plant to a team of investors led by John Hancock Financial (their Arclight division, or something like that)
seeking 20-25 year toll
Electric interconnection is South Acron bus (Lancaster, PA - eastern PJM)
Gas interconnection is direct to Columbia mainline
They are looking for an indicative number this monday, but admitted that it'll stretch out for at least a few weeks.

I'm in Houston through end of today, so please swing by or call me tomorrow at 978-449-9936 if you wish to discuss.  thanks
