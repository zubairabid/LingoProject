Fletcher Challenge Petroleum Inc. and ENA
CP #26315
Contract #96001010

It looks like the Counterparty group inactivated this counterparty in their system effective 9/12/98 due to a name change to Fletcher Challenge Energy Canada Inc. but I can't find any documentation on this so we still have an active contract in Global.

Can you all shed any light on this as to whether or not this CP's contract should be terminated?

-thanks again
