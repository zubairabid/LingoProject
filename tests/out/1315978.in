Legal is requesting some information for the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act filing related to the merger by the end of the day tomorrow.  Please see below.  I have listed the description of the codes below.  The information is requested for the year 2000.  Please provide a list of states in which Enron subsidiaries (entities incorporated in the U.S. only) which earned revenues in 2000 (1) have customers, (2) conduct their operations, or (3) have physical office locations (as specified below) for the following NAICS codes only.  The revenues should include intercompany revenues.

I am attaching a file which was compiled a few months ago, containing the largest Enron companies earning revenues in 2000 and their respective NAICS codes.  This is not all-inclusive, but is a good start.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Sal
