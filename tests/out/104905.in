Jody and Cris,

I became aware of the Duke deal late Monday.  Spent yesterday validating their assumptions and value which is no where near US$15.6. The MTM value looks like it will be around US$4MM.  We plan to finalized the MTM today. Remi was initially planning to prudence some of the value (with Lavo's approval).  However, that was before we added the Pis/Cofins tax assumptions.  Duke did pay us a R$15MM option premium on the deal.   Robin Veariel confirmed that ECE received that money yesterday.  Spoke with Paul Radous in credit and he is not taking a credit reserve because we are supposed to receive a parental guarantee.

I'll keep you posted.

Also, thanks for the message regarding the MTM.  I passed it on to Stacey.
