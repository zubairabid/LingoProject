I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB person with SoCal, concerning the SWG meeting
about PBCs on the SWG system.  As mentioned in the last note, SWG has
discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into
their system.  SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and
independent interconnects.  Liquids have been collected at the two
interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm,
respectively.  They have taken approx. 100 wipe samples and have had "hits"
but nothing over 100 ug per wipe.

In the meeting, SWG has expressed aggressive interest to SoCal about the
installation of filter separators at the SoCal/SWG interconnects.  They felt
that the installation of separators would greatly benefit the reduction of
PCBs into their system.  Becasue of this, Ralph stated that SWG would be
sending him a proposal for the installation of separators at the two
interconnect locations.  I gave Ralph Earl Chanleys phone number as he was
involved in the separator construction project last summer with PG&E.
