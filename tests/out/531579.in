Edison makes deal to pay generators of renewable power
Getting turned on over a turn-off
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 14, 2001)
Political action doesn't get much easier than this: Pull a plug. Flip a
switch.
If you dislike utilities, like the environment or know anyone who does you
might already have received an e-mail call to "Roll Your Own Blackout" for
three hours next week on the day of the summer solstice.
Flocks of anonymous e-mails have been swooping across the Internet for weeks
promoting the hand-rolled, voluntary blackout aimed at fostering
conservation.
It is a phenomenon that points out just how deeply energy issues have wormed
into the national consciousness, as well as how much the Internet has become
the world's water cooler and its bulletin board.
The messages urge people everywhere to turn out their lights and unplug what
they can from 7 to 10 p.m. Thursday, creating a dip in energy use that would
roll across time zones -- part protest and part party.
"Talk to your kids. Watch the stars come out. Cuddle. Pretend the TV's
broken. Think what can happen when tens of thousands join this peaceful
protest against price-gouging and environmental irresponsibility," exhorts a
Web page devoted to the idea.
Marilyn Nyborg of Grass Valley says she's thinking about flipping a circuit
breaker to cut off all power to her house Thursday night, but at the very
least her lights and television will be off.
"It's beautiful outside now. It's nice to sit on the porch. As it gets darker
I don't mind using a flashlight to read and spend some time with my partner
and our new kitties," she said.
Nyborg, 62, a high-tech recruiter who calls herself a "quiet activist," said
she'll be taking part to demonstrate that people can come together to
conserve.
"I take great offense at (President) Bush's comment that it's our right as
Americans to waste fuel. I don't think it is. We're also stewards of the
planet," she said.
David Aragon, a Berkeley engineer who says he coined the phrase "Roll Your
Own Blackout" online for a similar protest, said the idea had its roots in
politics but is nonpartisan.
He said he just learned this week that Los Angeles artist Monica Rex was the
one who expanded his notion, scheduled it for the first day of summer and
sent it out into the world.
Rex said she e-mailed a few paragraphs to about 50 friends in mid-April and
posted them on a handful of Web sites to make people aware that they have the
power over how energy is used.
She thought so little of it at the time that she didn't keep a copy.
"I didn't know it would get anywhere, actually," she said. But it took off.
By mid-May, multiple copies were landing in e-mail boxes of nearly everyone
with environmental or energy interests. An organic farming public relations
firm publicized it further, saying "millions" of people had been alerted.
Newspapers from Seattle to Denver began writing about the anonymous
upswelling. Web pages sprang up dedicated to it.
"Everyone I know has seen it. This has swept the globe," said Jeff Softley, a
West Hollywood bartender and longtime environmentalist who has tried for more
than a decade to promote the idea of an "Energy Fast" on Earth Day.
Softley, who knows a little about stirring up community action, was so struck
by how quickly the message moved that he speculated a big environmental group
was probably behind it, trying to appear grass-roots.
"I just think it caught people's imagination," said Rex. "I am just amazed at
how things move around the Internet." She theorizes that her name was
stripped off early in the forwarding process, making it appear anonymous when
she had no particular interest in either hiding from the idea or in promoting
it.
It really doesn't take much to bring a single idea to millions of people,
said David Goff, a University of Southern Mississippi professor who co-edited
the book "Understanding the Web."
"When you get it in the hands of like-minded people, it doesn't take long for
that multiplier effect to operate, and it will go very far very fast," he
said.
E-mail- and Web-driven protests have triggered fuel boycotts in Great Britain
and Internet boycotts in France, Goff said, and "we're in the early stages of
this."
The whimsical blackout message -- circulated in several versions -- calls on
people turn off what they can, then "light a candle to the sun god, kiss and
tell, make love, tell ghost stories, do something instead of watching
television, have fun in the dark."
Many versions say the voluntary blackout -- "a simple protest and a symbolic
act" -- is being held to protest Bush's disdain for conservation, energy
efficiency and alternative fuels.
Some variants direct people to books on alternative energy and energy
efficiency. Some say the candle should burn for the sun goddess. Some add a
gentle caution, to unplug only what can be "safely" dispensed with.
Michael Straus of Point Reyes said he plans to take part by having a
candlelight dinner with his parents. Straus, whose "Beyond Organic" PR firm
helped tout the idea, said he put the message out over a public interest and
academic news wire after it kept landing in his mailbox.
The message has zinged from state to state and reportedly reached Europe and
Asia. It has hit e-mail lists devoted to everything from feminism to
used-book sellers. A Texas newspaper credited it to a river protection group
called American Rivers, something the flattered but bemused organization
denied.
Millions of people would have to be involved for their efforts to show up on
the computers of the California Independent System Operator in Folsom, which
constantly monitors electricity use to match demand with supply.
If 10 million households turned off a single 100 watt light bulb at once, 100
megawatts would drop off the state's electric grid -- probably not noticeable
amid 30,000 or so megawatts of early evening demand, said Jim Detmers, an ISO
vice president.
But 200 to 300 megawatts of reduced demand might be detectable under the
right conditions, if sudden changes in wind or temperatures or cloud cover
don't obscure the effect, he said.
Computer engineer Aragon said he has no idea how many people will turn off
and tune out June 21.
"That's almost like speculating on the spot price of electricity," he said.
"I wouldn't touch it."

New pacts could ease blackouts: Edison crafts five-year deals to help relieve
the fiscal burden on its alternative energy suppliers.
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 14, 2001)
In a move that could help ease blackouts this summer, Southern California
Edison has negotiated five-year deals designed to relieve the financial
burden on its alternative energy suppliers.
Gov. Gray Davis hailed the pacts, which state officials helped negotiate, as
an important step toward stabilizing the energy market and ending litigation
over about $1.3 billion owed by Edison.
The move also could help taxpayers, cutting up to $100 million off the
state's energy tab this year by reducing the amount of power needed from the
expensive spot market, officials said.
The agreements apply specifically to Edison's suppliers, however, and do not
resolve similar disputes involving Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
The pacts also add a new twist to an ongoing dispute over Davis' bid to save
Edison from bankruptcy by buying its transmission lines for $2.76 billion and
providing other financial incentives.
Davis warned at a press conference Wednesday that rates promised in the pacts
are tied to legislative approval of the rescue plan.
"I believe, given the changed circumstances, that legislators will take a
different look at the (plan)," he said. "I'm not saying it's a certainty, but
I'm saying there's now renewed interest."
Senate President John Burton ridiculed the governor's assertion and made it
clear he won't be pressured.
"There are an awful lot of questions here, and I think it ill behooves the
governor, who has not always moved with alacrity, to say that the Legislature
is dragging its hands on this issue," Burton said.
Legislators currently are crafting one or more alternatives to the governor's
rescue plan, which they say has little support in the Assembly or Senate.
Southern California Edison, a massive private utility, declined comment
Wednesday on the QF -- "qualified facilities" -- agreements or the governor's
rescue plan.
California taxpayers have spent billions of dollars since January buying
power on behalf of Edison and another financially strapped private utility,
PG&E.
One major problem for Edison has been the $1.3 billion debt owed to firms
that generate alternative energy from wind, geothermal, solar, biomass and
gas-fired cogeneration facilities.
As debts rose each week, some QFs were forced to quit producing electricity,
thus exacerbating the energy crisis and forcing California to buy more power
on the spot market.
Statewide, most of the alternative energy providers, though still financially
strapped, have resumed production.
The new Edison pacts would add 100 to 300 megawatts of new electricity by
enticing suppliers to exceed existing contracts.
They would provide a mechanism for repaying Edison's debts to the alternative
energy firms. They also promise separate rates for electricity from renewable
sources and gas-fired facilities.
Key parts of the deal include:
Rates for electricity produced by gas-fired plants would vary based on the
cost of natural gas at the California-Arizona border.
Edison would pay 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, plus a capacity charge, for
energy produced by wind, solar and other renewable energy sources.
The firm would pay an estimated 4 to 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, depending on
natural gas costs, for electricity produced by gas-fired plants.
The pacts give Edison and the owners of gas-fired cogeneration facilities the
ability to renegotiate if market conditions change dramatically.
"The initial reaction from a number of (firms) has been favorable," said
Steven Kelly of Independent Energy Producers, an association of wholesalers.
"We're hopeful this can be implemented in PG&E territory, too," said Joe
Ronan, an official of the Calpine energy firm and chairman of Independent
Energy Producers.

Lockyer to seek grand jury probe of power players
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published June 14, 2001)
Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday that he will ask the Sacramento
County grand jury to look into potential criminal actions by power generators
and natural gas companies that have led to skyrocketing wholesale power
prices.
Lockyer said he has reached no conclusions about possible criminal acts by "a
dozen or so" companies his office is investigating, but is hopeful grand jury
testimony will assist in the probe.
"I just want to make sure that we thoroughly investigate every possibility,"
Lockyer said. "Some people conclude that we don't have evidence. That's not
what I'm saying either. I'm saying we're in the middle of evaluating the
evidence."
Lockyer will take the investigation to the grand jury after July 1, when 19
jurors convene for the new fiscal year. He would not predict how long the
process would last.
He said many of the 80 lawyers in his office assigned to the energy crisis
are looking at possible civil violations relating to market manipulation and
other allegations against power players.
Possible criminal violations involve the state's racketeering, unfair
business practices, fraud and antitrust statutes, Lockyer said.
Power companies have consistently denied allegations that they have violated
any civil or criminal statutes.
Besides Lockyer's probe, several legislative committees are investigating
power interests' actions in California's energy crisis.

Energy Digest: PUC: Edison must pay some QF debts
(Published June 14, 2001)
Southern California Edison should pay at least 15 percent of its back debts
to any alternative power producer, called a "qualifying facility," that needs
the money to get back into operation this summer, utility regulators agreed
Wednesday.
The 5-0 decision by the state Public Utilities Commission also endorsed
agreements reached Tuesday between Edison and some key qualifying facilities
that call for incentive payments for increased production and a price of $54
a megawatt-hour for five years for some producers.
Ensuring that every power plant is up and running at maximum levels this
summer will be critical to keeping prices low and blackouts rare,
commissioners said. However, several added that they supported the revised
contracts reluctantly because of long-term costs.
"California consumers have overpaid billions of dollars to QFs" already, said
Commissioner Carl Wood. He warned that as more new plants are built, "we may
not need this power, and yet we will be obligated to purchase it at prices
that are vastly higher than other power that will be available."

New members rock FERC
WASHINGTON -- The arrival of two new members is showing signs of shaking up
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a once-obscure agency that may be
the best hope for controlling wholesale electricity prices in power-starved
California.
Patrick Wood III, former chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, and
Nora Mead Brownell, a former member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission, will participate in their first meeting Monday when the panel
meets in an unusual session on California rates.
Among those most heartened to see the new members was William Massey, a
Democrat and frequent dissenter on the five-member panel who strongly favors
price controls to head off what he has described as a looming economic
catastrophe for the state this summer.
"I never thought I would be so thrilled to see two Republicans coming over
the horizon," Massey said.
Massey's enthusiasm is shared by many California Democrats who believe Wood
and Brownell will tilt the balance toward stronger action in their crusade
for lower wholesale rates.

New price restrictions for electricity said to be coming
By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
WASHINGTON ) Under growing political pressure, federal regulators are
preparing new but still limited price restrictions for electricity in
California and other Western states, according to government officials.
Congressional and private industry sources said the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission is almost certain, at a meeting next week, to expand a price
mitigation directive to cover all transactions in California and expand it to
other states, including the Pacific Northwest.
The limited price caps, announced in April, now apply only to California and
only to periods when a supply emergency is in effect because power reserves
have fallen below 7.5 percent. California Gov. Gray Davis has called them
inadequate and full of loopholes for power generators to skirt controls.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told a Senate hearing "it now appears" that
the April order will be broadened. She said it was "another step forward" but
far short of the cost-based price caps she and other congressional Democrats
have sought.
Several other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said they
expected the FERC to broaden the April order.
The commission chairman, Curtis Hebert, said price mitigation issues will be
discussed at its Monday meeting.
The five-member commission of three Republicans and two Democrats has come
under attack from Democrats in Congress and from Davis. They contend the
agency has been far too timid in curtailing price gouging in the wholesale
Western power markets.
The commission regulates wholesale electricity markets and interstate natural
gas pipelines. Under a 1934 law, it is required to ensure prices are just and
reasonable.
Hebert, a Republican named as chairman by President Bush in January, defended
the agency at an energy forum Wednesday.
"Our price mitigation plan is working," said Hebert, citing recent declines
in electricity and natural gas prices in California and elsewhere in the
West. Acknowledging the criticism, he said of the FERC: "We're not the most
popular people in town right now."
This week, electricity prices on the spot market in California fell to below
$100 a megawatt-hour for the first time this year. Natural gas prices also
eased. Earlier year price have frequently surpassed $300 a megawatt hour, ten
times what they were in pre-crisis 1999.
A megawatt is enough electricity to serve about 600 homes.
California officials have said it is too early to tell how the FERC's April
order has affected prices.
The reason for the price drops is unclear, Feinstein said. She noted that
California's attorney general this week announced plans for a grand jury to
consider criminal charges against some power generators and marketers.
Also Wednesday, several economists told a Senate hearing that temporary price
controls, if structured properly, should not impede electricity investments
and supplies as Republican lawmakers and the administration repeatedly have
argued.
"It is incorrect that regulation necessarily interferes with supplies,"
Cornell economist Alfred Kahn, a prominent deregulation advocate, told the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
It was the Senate's first hearing on California's energy crisis since
Democrats recently took power.
Kahn said that if price caps were temporary, exempted new power plants, and
provided sufficient profits, "there will be no shortage of people interested
and willing to build new power plants."
"The greatest danger is continued chaos," said Paul Joskow, an economist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He, too, urged some price controls
based on costs of production.
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said the economists were painting " a rosy
picture." He read letters from several Wall Street analysts who insisted that
price controls would be a "recipe for disaster" and make investors reluctant
to enter the California power market.
Senate Democrats have promised to move forward with legislation to require
the FERC to act unless the commission takes additional steps to address
allegations of price gouging in California.
"If we ignore these problems, we put our economy at risk," said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.

Governor plans to release details on state's power purchases
By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) California signed long-term electricity contracts at prices
higher than those now available on the daily spot market, Gov. Gray Davis
acknowledged Wednesday as a judge ordered him to release the pacts' details.
But Davis said the long-term contracts between the state and power generators
helped break the price spiral that had driven electricity prices to record
heights.
Critics said other factors played a larger role in what they warned is a
temporary price drop, and said Davis foolishly locked in long-term rates at
the market's peak.
"The price, the spot market on electricity is coming down because we've
locked in long-term contracts," Davis said. "This is Economics 101. ... We
were paying a lot more in January and February than we are now on the spot
market because we have dramatically shrunk the spot market, providing
reliable power for California at affordable rates."
By next month, the state will have to buy less than half the power it needs
on the daily market, making the generators compete for a smaller share of the
market and forcing prices down, he said.
Davis said that will stabilize a wildly fluctuating market for the long term,
although the cost may exceed market costs in years to come.
The contracts, along with new plants, more conservation, criminal and
regulatory investigations into price gouging and possible price caps have
combined to cut costs, Davis said.
Saying "there will be a day of accounting" for price gougers, Davis also said
a "pincer effort from Sacramento and Washington" forced energy producers to
lower prices.
Davis appeared Wednesday as a San Diego superior court judge ordered the
state to release the contract details by noon Friday.
Several news organizations and Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland,
R-Thousand Oaks, sued Davis, saying the contracts used state money and should
be open to the public.
For months, Davis had refused to do so, saying that would hurt the state's
negotiating position. Earlier this week, however, he asked San Diego Superior
Court Judge Linda B. Quinn to lift the confidentiality clauses in the 38
contracts, because the secrecy was no longer that important.
The contracts, worth almost $43 billion, could keep long-term rates
relatively high for years if the recent decline in prices remains in place.
Contract records obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed the state is
committed to buying power at prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour during peak
demand periods and more than $95 for power at times when demand is low.
By comparison, the state recently bought peak power for less than $100 an
hour and less than $20 an hour at night when demand is less.
Wholesale prices have dropped recently, but they could rise this summer when
temperatures and air conditioning use climb.
Energy analysts agreed with Davis that a convergence of factors led to lower
prices, not just the long-term contracts.
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy
Institute, called the prices in the state's contracts "disturbingly high"
compared to those available a few years ago, but the state didn't have much
choice.
In essence, Borenstein said, the contracts mean California now pays its high
power bill "on an installment plan" in which generators agree to string out
their profits over years instead of recouping them now.
But Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California, Irvine, said
the Davis administration negotiated "from a position of severe weakness. They
(generators) had us over a barrel and they stuck it to us."
Davis, Navarro said, "adopted a long-term strategy to fight a short-term
crisis."
The administration will look particularly foolish if the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission acts next week to rein in higher power prices after
months of refusing to intervene, Navarro said.
"This is a huge mistake that's been made by the state and what's being shown
here is the depth of it," said Assemblyman David Cogdill, R-Modesto, who
supported Strickland's suit.
"In effect, we locked in an energy crisis for the next 10 years," said Harvey
Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. He called for
Attorney General Bill Lockyer to toss out any contracts he determines
overcharge the state.
Davis energy adviser S. David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, said the contracts altered the marketplace and
freed the state from its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market.
"The war ain't over," Freeman said, "but we have landed on enemy territory
and we are rolling them back."
Draft of blackout plan offers forecasts instead of warnings
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) In May, Gov. Gray Davis announced a plan to give Californians
detailed warnings of rolling blackouts to help businesses and residents plan
for outages.
But a draft of the plan, obtained by The Associated Press, has changed the
proposed one-hour "blackout warning" to a "probability forecast," which one
utility official called a "vague warning that's wrong more often than it's
right."
The one-hour notice is expected to be wrong two-thirds of the time, because
the Independent System Operator will continue to look for power to keep the
lights on, said several people who participated in meetings to plan the
blackout notifications.
Under Davis' plan, the ISO, manager of the state's power grid, will also
issue a 48-hour rolling blackout forecast and the 24-hour location
notification.
Peter Navarro, an economist with University of California, Irvine who works
on energy issues, called the one-hour blackout notice "a very blunt
instrument."
"It's going to be like the typical California forecast ) sunny, hot and dry
with a chance of rolling blackouts," Navarro said. "How do you prepare for
that?"
The Governor's Office of Emergency Services coordinated the plan to implement
Davis' order by consulting private and municipal utilities, the ISO and the
Public Utilities Commission. The plan will be presented to Davis by Friday.
Even after the issuing the 60-minute blackout notice, the state will keep
looking for last-minute power, said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. "The
public knows the ISO doesn't have a crystal ball, but it can provide
information to help them make critical decisions."
A utility official, who participated in the calls and who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said the one-hour blackout probability forecast
"doesn't come anywhere close to what's been promised to the public.
"Instead of a real one-hour notice of an outage that people can rely on and
make plans for, they're just going to get another vague warning that's going
to be wrong far more often than it's right," the executive said.
The utilities will make the biggest differences in handling blackouts, said
Steve Conroy, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, which participated
in one of the conference calls.
"There is more advance notice from the utilities to our customers," Conroy
said.
Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. have joined Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. in assigning customers a "block number" so they will know what
neighborhood are next to be hit by a blackout.
"The newest element that's required is to make geographic information
available to the public. It was already available to public safety offices,"
said John Nelson, spokesman for PG&E.
Blackout forecasts, Conroy said, are "very much like a weather forecast" and
subject to change. McCorkle said forecasts will also encourage power
conservation and further lessen the chance of blackouts.
Eric Lamoureux, an emergency services spokesman, said the plan isn't intended
to predict a blackout but give a sense of when they're likely.
Utility customers don't need a guarantee, just a warning that blackouts could
occur, said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers' Action
Network.
"The objective here is to allow customers to prepare for the eventuality of
blackouts," he said. "The people will not rebel if the lights stay on. What
we do need is more than 30 minutes notice."
Jennifer Ng, the owner of Moonlight Cleaners in Elk Grove, said she'd welcome
two days' notice for blackout. It took her more than a week to catch up on
work that a couple hours of blackouts halted at the dry cleaners, she said.
"It affects businesses more than people think," Ng said. "If I had more
warning, I would be able to stay late the night before or bring in more
people."
To really give a true blackout warning, Shames said, the ISO must "draw the
line" and stop shopping for electricity to keep the lights on.
Plus, Shames added, repeated false alarms could lose their effectiveness.
"That's why they shouldn't be issued cavalierly."
Shames and Navarro have called for a price ceiling for last-minute power buys
and a willingness to suffer blackouts in prices don't come down. The
Legislature is now considering a bill to allow state power buyers to stop
shopping for power.
California governor to release details of state's power purchases
By Alexa Haussler
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Gov. Gray Davis is close to releasing details of 38 long-term
contracts between the state and power generators, a move that would end a
lengthy battle over whether the agreements should remain confidential.
Davis for months had refused to release information on the contracts, but his
aides said Tuesday the disclosure was expected this week.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that confidential government records
show state officials agreed to contracts at prices higher than those now
being paid in the daily spot market.
The contracts, which total nearly $43 billion, could burden consumers with
relatively high utility rates if the recent trend toward lower electricity
and natural gas prices continues.
Records obtained by the Times show the state is committed to buying power at
prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour during peak demand periods and more than
$95 for power at times when demand is low. In comparison, the state recently
purchased peak power for less than $100 an hour and less than $20 an hour at
night when demand dropped.
The recent purchases reflect a drop in wholesale prices, which could rise
again this summer when temperatures climb and air conditioning use surges.
"The theme here is the governor embarked on a long-term strategy for a
short-term crisis," Peter Navarro, an economist at University of California
Irvine, told the Times. "They pretty much got this exactly wrong."
State officials defended the long-term contracts, crediting the agreements
with altering the marketplace. The contracts also have freed the state from
its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market.
"This was all a well thought-through plan of action," said Davis energy
adviser S. David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power. "The war ain't over. But we have landed on enemy territory and we
are rolling them back."
Republican lawmakers and several news organizations, including The Associated
Press, sued Davis in March, saying his refusal to release the contracts'
details violated the California Public Records Act.
Still, Davis refused, saying that revealing the details would put the state
at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks.
Oklahoma-based Williams Energy, one of the generators with a state contract,
opposes the release of the contract details.
"Information contained in those is proprietary information that allows us to
be competitive and to bid competitively," said spokeswoman Paula
Hall-Collins.
Raymond Hart, Department of Water Resources deputy director, wrote power
generators Monday saying the department would ask a judge Wednesday to throw
out a confidentiality provision in the contracts.
Meanwhile, the Times also reported Wednesday that executives and board
directors from power companies gained millions of dollars through stock sales
last year.
State officials accuse them of profiteering from the energy crisis, but some
executives netted upwards of $123 million in option transactions in 2000,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stock
prices for energy companies enjoyed robust growth last year.
Report: Energy executives selling stock for millions

LOS ANGELES ) Executives and board directors from power companies that state
officials accuse of profiteering from the energy crisis have gained millions
of dollars through stock sales, according to a newspaper report.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that these executives exercised
options and sold stock for double, triple and even 10 times the level of
prior years. The newspaper based its findings on trading data supplied by
First Call/Thomson Financial and federal regulatory findings.
Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of Enron, netted $123 million in option transactions
in 2000, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The amount was triple his 1999 level and nearly 10 times what he made in
1998.
Lay also has made stock sales since November that have been worth nearly $23
million.
Lay and other power company executives have shown a knack for timing their
stock sales near the top of the market. Many of the companies' shares have
fallen since the bulk of the stock sales, the Times reported.
Critics claim corporate profits for the power companies have been driven up
by the energy crisis in California and the West. The crisis created a bull
market for publicly traded power companies, making the shares held by the
executives particularly lucrative.
State officials were outraged, but not surprised by the transactions.
"It is part of a pattern of smart trading by these guys," said state Sen.
Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, who chairs the Senate Energy, Utilities and
Communications Committee. "The mentality is to get everything that you can
and then ride out the bust.
"I think they are figuring that by this time next year the party will be over
and they will be left sitting in a room with plastic cups half-filled with
stale beer," Bowen added.
The stock sales seemed logical to Loretta Lynch, president of the California
Public Utilities Commission.
"It stands to reason that if the companies are making exorbitant profits,
then the individuals who run the companies are also making exorbitant
profits," she said.
The power executives who sold stock dealt shares of the following companies:
Virginia-based AES Corp.; Duke Energy Corp. of North Carolina, the
Houston-based energy firms of Enron Corp. and El Paso Corp. and San
Jose-based Calpine Corp.
Jeffrey K. Skilling, CEO of Enron, filed regulatory documents in May
announcing his intention to sell 140,000 shares of Enron stock for $7.98
million. Skilling in 2000 netted more than $62 million in similar
transactions.
Harvey Padewer, president of Duke Energy's Energy Services division, sold
Duke stock for $12.26 million in February, netting $2.99 million.
State and federal agencies are investigating several large energy companies
to determine if they conspired to boost prices either by limiting the
construction of power plants or by manipulating the supply of natural gas
needed to run power plants.
No one is claiming the stock trades were illegal, but critics have linked the
transactions to the profits gained in California.
"The generators have no shame," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov.
Gray Davis. "It speaks to how there has been a massive transfer of wealth
from California and the West to Texas and the Southeast."
Lay and Enron officials declined to comment on stock trading by executives
and a spokesman for AES also declined to comment on the matter.
A spokesman for Duke Energy said many of the sellers at Duke continue to hold
large amounts of the company's stock and sold the their stock to capitalize
on a healthy market.
"Many of these people have a lot of stock, and this 7/16is 3/8 an opportunity
to diversify their personal portfolios at an opportune time when Duke's stock
is up," said Terry Francisco, a spokesman for Duke Energy.

HUNTINGTON BEACH ) An energy company says a restriction prohibiting it from
selling power generated at its California plants out-of-state violates
interstate commerce laws.
AES Corp. filed a petition Monday with the California Energy Commission
claiming the restriction should be withdrawn because it hinders the company's
efforts to negotiate a contract with the state Department of Water Resources,
which brokers power deals for the state.
AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said Tuesday that the two sides are close to an
agreement and filing the petition was a backup if negotiations fail.
The Arlington, Va.-based company recently won approval from the state's
Energy Commission to restart two idle generators in Huntington Beach, but
were told it could only sell the 450 megawatts produced at the Orange County
plant to California utilities.
The 40-year-old units, which will reopen in August, will generate 10 percent
of the 5,000 megawatts needed by the state to avoid rolling blackouts this
summer.
Customers of SDG&E may not get back $300 million
Money might be part of state deal to buy electric grid
By Jeff McDonald
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 14, 2001
Talks to allow state ownership of the poles and wires that push electricity
across San Diego County have dragged on in numbing detail for months.
But with the deal between Gov. Gray Davis and Sempra Energy "extremely
close," local politicians and a consumer advocate fear its price will include
hundreds of millions of dollars that had been headed for ratepayers' pockets.
San Diego city and county officials took the unusual step yesterday of
criticizing regulators and the parent company of SDG&E for excluding them
from secret negotiations.

FERC appears set to expand its price curbs
Davis announces deal to boost summer power supply
Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis
Mayor Dick Murphy, meanwhile, dispatched a letter to the president of the
California Public Utilities Commission pleading to be invited to the table.
"I need your assurance that the city will be permitted to actively
participate in the formation of any proposed settlement," the San Diego mayor
wrote. "The ratepayers of San Diego city and county deserve no less."
At stake: more than $300 million paid to SDG&E by its 1.2 million customers
over recent months.
Utility company executives claim the cash should go to shareholders, while
local elected officials, consumer advocates and even state regulators say the
money belongs to customers.
The disputed windfall accumulated over several months, as SDG&E used
long-term contracts to buy power at one price then sell the electricity to
consumers at a much higher rate.
Customers were billed the larger of the two costs, a practice SDG&E parent
Sempra Energy said was appropriate even though SDG&E has insisted for months
that under deregulation it merely distributes power.
"Shareholders deserve to make money on contracts that they took the risk
for," said company spokesman Ed Van Herik, who was unable to specify how much
electricity is bought and sold under the agreements.
SDG&E may still be benefiting from the long-term deals it reached with
Louisville Gas and Electricand Pacificorp.
The agreements ran between 1997 and the end of this year, according to San
Diego City Attorney Casey Gwinn. Because of the litigation, he was allowed to
review the contracts but is not permitted to disclose their value.
"There is a fundamental fairness principle that is at issue here," Gwinn
said.
Earlier this year, state regulators ruled that the value of the contracts
should help pay down a so-called balancing account -- some $750 million SDG&E
says it spent on power but hasn't been allowed to collect from customers.
Utility company lawyers appealed that ruling and the case remains locked in
litigation.
But in an apparent policy reversal, the PUC last week joined Sempra in asking
the appeals court to delay considering the claim while the governor's office
deals for the network of SDG&E power poles and transmission lines. Gwinn's
office was served notice of that filing Tuesday.
The value of the long-term contracts has become a critical issue in those
executive-level discussions, which San Diego area politicians say is unfair.
"It's a slap in the face," county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said. "They charged
us more and now they're making a big profit."
Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network said a closed-door
deal between Davis and Sempra could undermine the PUC ruling that the SDG&E
contracts are ratepayer assets.
"The PUC will never hear it, the city of San Diego and UCAN will never get a
chance to argue it" in court, he said.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor is carefully weighing the
plight of San Diego consumers as he pushes ahead with negotiations to buy the
SDG&E electric grid.
"We're extremely close to an agreement with the utility, and first and
foremost in the governor's mind are the interests of San Diego ratepayers,"
he said. "The deal is going to be a balanced business transaction."
Acquiring the poles and wires that move power across the state is a key piece
of the governor's plan to resolve the electricity crisis in California. Davis
struck a deal with Southern California Edison, but Pacific Gas and Electric
declared bankruptcy in April, so those assets are in dispute.
Even though transmission lines make money for the three investor-owned
utilities, critics worry that buying the electric grid may not be wise
because the system is old and in need of more than $1 billion in upgrades.
PUC attorney Gary Cohen said he sympathizes with the San Diego County elected
officials who first brought the complaint over the SDG&E contracts to his
office. But ending the power struggle in California is more important.
"If there's a deal, those contracts are just one part of it," Cohen said. "I
understand their frustration. The contracts are up on appeal and they won.
But in fairness, everybody needs to wait and see what the whole resolution
will be."
Discussions include not only talk of a price for SDG&E transmission lines --
likely around $1 billion, according to Shames -- but also whether the utility
adequately hedged its power purchases against rising costs and the
reasonableness of other buying practices.
"There's a bunch of issues on the table," Cohen said. "It's difficult and
conceivably impossible to settle cases where you have a whole bunch of
parties if everybody is insisting they're part of the negotiations."
State Sen. Dede Alpert, whose September legislation established the
"balancing account" now in dispute, said she doesn't care who receives public
accolades for steering the value of the SDG&E contracts to ratepayers.
"I certainly expect this needs to be something that benefits the people of
San Diego," the Coronado Democrat said. "But whether the credit goes to the
city of San Diego, the PUC or the governor I don't think matters."
Vallejo City Council votes to switch work hours to save power
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
VALLEJO ) In an effort to save an estimated $11,000 in electricity costs,
City Council members unanimously voted to switch city hall workers to a
four-day workweek.
The 7-0 vote came Tuesday as a result of the city's increased energy bills.
Since the Association of Bay Area Governments suspended its electricity
purchasing program, which allowed participants to buy power cheaper than
other cities, Vallejo has seen an increase from 9.5 cents a kilowatt hour to
20 cents per kilowatt hour.
The switch to 10-hour days begins July 9 and will continue through Nov. 9.
City Hall will be open 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday. The
current hours are 8:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Police and fire departments will be unaffected by the change.
City officials also recently negotiated with O'Hara Energy Corp. to install
special meters to monitor and control energy use at City Hall. That program
is expected to save $50,000.
Davis announces deal to boost summer power supply
By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 14, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis, claiming momentum toward solving the
electricity crisis, announced an agreement yesterday to keep unpaid small
generators on line this summer.
Davis said a pincers movement from Washington, D.C., and Sacramento is
telling energy price-gougers that "the days of figuratively raping and
pillaging California are over and there will be an accounting."
Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced that a criminal grand jury will begin
meeting in Sacramento early next month to investigate whether the state's
electricity and natural gas markets were manipulated and whether illegal
profits were made.
Davis also said he was optimistic about getting legislative approval of some
variation of his long-stalled plan to keep Southern California Edison out of
bankruptcy.
"I'm not saying it's a certainty," Davis said. "But I am saying there is now
a renewed interest in ratifying something like the memorandum of
understanding that we have worked out with Edison."
Davis said the Legislature can change the proposal, but the amendments must
be acceptable to him and to Edison. The Senate is planning to begin hearings
on the Edison plan in a few weeks.
The governor said pressure on electricity suppliers is coming from
investigations, long-term contracts that have lowered spot market prices and
increased energy conservation by Californians.
Davis said pressure in Washington is coming from congressional hearings and
the possibility that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will order
regional price limits or refunds for overcharges in California.
The governor also said three new power plants could begin operating in the
next 30 days, an apparent reference to Calpine's 500-megawatt plant near Yuba
City and its 559-megawatt plant at Pittsburg and a 320-megawatt Mission
Energy-Texaco plant in Kern County.
The small non-utility generators that operate as "qualifying facilities"
under a federal program are capable of providing about a quarter of the power
needed by the state.
In March, blackouts during two days were said to have resulted, in part, from
small generators who were not operating because they had not been paid. Davis
announced an agreement yesterday between Edison and its QF contractors.
The Davis administration thinks the agreement could produce an additional 100
to 300 megawatts of power (a megawatt is enough for 750 to 1,000 homes) this
summer because some generators had previously contracted to sell less power
than they are capable of producing.
Richard Katz, a former assemblyman from Van Nuys asked by Davis to negotiate
the agreement, said the QF contractors will receive an average of about 11
cents per kilowatt-hour during the five-year contracts.
Katz said generators who use renewable energy sources -- such as solar, wind,
geothermal, and biomass -- will be paid an average of about 7.37 cents per
kilowatt-hour.
He said that co-generators, who use natural gas and sell the excess heat to
businesses, will receive an average of 15 cents to 16 cents per
kilowatt-hour.
The generators will receive 10 percent of the money they are owed when the
contracts are signed, and the full debt eventually will be paid with
interest.
Katz said the new rates for the small contractors are tied to legislative
approval of the Edison rescue plan. But Senate President Pro Tempore John
Burton, D-San Francisco, disagreed, saying action by the Public Utilities
Commission yesterday implemented the agreement between Edison and the small
contractors.
FERC appears set to expand its price curbs
By Joe Cantlupe
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 14, 2001
WASHINGTON -- Facing mounting political pressure, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission seems poised next week to greatly expand existing
energy price restrictions that now kick in only during emergencies.
Hints of the move surfaced yesterday as a Senate committee started
investigating FERC's response to the California power crisis.
The current order limits prices only when the state's power reserves dip
below 7.5 percent, the level at which a Stage 1 alert is called.
Critics, including Gov. Gray Davis, say that order is full of loopholes
because any price can be charged when no emergency has been declared, which
is most of the time.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the Governmental Affairs Committee
yesterday that "it now appears that on Monday, FERC may extend this order to
the entire Western energy market and may ensure that the order stays in place
at all times."
"This sounds good on the face of it, and it may well be," added Feinstein.
"However, this situation is ripe for manipulation, as I believe they have
been doing," she said of power generators in the state.
She said that FERC is essentially considering a "flexible price cap" that,
like the existing order, sets the price on the cost of producing electricity
at the most-costly, least-efficient power plant.
FERC officials declined to discuss the agency's possible action next week, or
Feinstein's remarks.
FERC's previous "price mitigation" order went into effect May 29 and some
federal regulators say it caused wholesale electricity prices to plummet in
California. Megawatts that once cost an average of more than $300 -- and
sometimes several thousand dollars -- recently dropped to below $100 during
peak usage. A megawatt powers about 750 homes.
But some observers say that many factors are responsible for the sudden price
drop, including cooler weather, conservation and state long-term electricity
contracts.
At a meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco
yesterday, Chairwoman Loretta Lynch said she is "very encouraged" that FERC
is reconsidering its earlier decision, but said the result would be
"absolutely inadequate" because FERC would cap prices at a relatively high
rate, according to The Associated Press.
Yesterday's Washington hearing by the Governmental Affairs Committee was the
Democratic-controlled Senate's first foray into California's emotionally
charged power crisis and seemed a harbinger of intensified partisan wrangling
to come.
Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., used the hearing to make pleas
for immediate action on price caps and to complain about FERC.
"Today, we see no semblance of really meaningful regulation," Feinstein said.
Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman agreed.
"The fact of the matter is that the California market is not even
functional," said Lieberman, D-Conn. "I think it's fair to say if the federal
government doesn't step in and provide temporary price relief, the natural
trend toward deregulation will come to a halt."
California officials have sought price caps to rein in what they term
outrageous electricity costs charged by out-of-state companies.
But the Bush administration has vehemently opposed caps, saying they would
discourage investment in new power plants.
In recent weeks, however, some key congressional Republicans have softened
their position, saying they would not oppose limited controls.
FERC itself -- heavily criticized by Davis and others as a do-nothing agency
-- appears to be showing a new face, with two new members appointed by Bush
promising more aggressive monitoring of the power industry.
Feinstein and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, have sponsored bills that
would enact tougher price caps. The legislation is expected to be debated
later this month.
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the ranking Republican on the committee, opposed
Boxer and Feinstein's calls for price caps and said that California officials
were partly to blame for the state's problems for acting "too late."
State must bare secret energy deals
Judge orders release of pacts with suppliers
By Karen Kucher and Craig D. Rose
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS
June 14, 2001
The state's secret energy deals won't be secret much longer.
Even as some details about California's long-term power contracts began to
emerge, a Superior Court judge yesterday ordered the almost-full release of
the state's agreements with power suppliers by noon tomorrow to attorneys
representing news organizations and a dozen state lawmakers.
Judge Linda B. Quinn also set a hearing for June 27 to decide whether to
order the state to release information about its costly spot-market
electricity purchases, something the state only wants to do six months after
the transactions are completed.
The news organizations and legislators filed suit under the Public Records
Act, seeking the contracts that bind the state to more than $40 billion in
power purchases over the next decade.
Revelations that California has contracted to pay as much as $154 per
megawatt-hour to Constellation Energy Group Inc. quickly brought complaints
that the state had overpaid for electricity. The price of the commodity is
now plunging.
The Los Angeles Times and at least one other newspaper, which obtained some
of the long-term state contracts, reported that power costs ranged to as low
as $58, and down to about $22 when the state supplies fuel to generating
plants.
By comparison, spot prices yesterday for power were from $55 to $65 per
megawatt-hour, far below levels earlier this year when prices averaged more
than $250 for several months and reached a high of nearly $3,900.
Until last June, prices rarely exceeded $50 per megawatt-hour. Deregulation
advocates said prices would decline as the market was opened up.
Gov. Gray Davis' strategy in dealing with budget-busting costs over the past
year has been to sign long-term deals to avoid buying in daily markets.
Yesterday, he said comparing contracted electricity costs to spot prices is
unfair.
"The price of spot market electricity is coming down because we have locked
in long-term contracts," Davis said. "We knew this going in. The purpose of
getting long-term contracts is to wean ourselves away from a spot market."
The governor referred to the often-cited criticism that California's soaring
power prices were caused partly by an excessive dependence on buying power in
daily markets, as opposed to under longer contracts.
Severin Borenstein, an expert in electrical deregulation from the University
of California Energy Institute, agreed that comparing current spot prices
with contract prices was unfair.
Speaking at a news conference yesterday hosted by the governor's press
secretary, Borenstein said the deals should be analyzed in the context of
conditions that existed as they were negotiated.
Spot prices during the first three months of this year, for example, averaged
about $285 per megawatt hour.
But a prominent critic of deregulation said that neither buying strategy
presented an acceptable option for consumers.
"They gouge you with spot prices or they gouge with term contracts," said
Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights in Santa Monica, which is expected to lead a ballot initiative next
year over deregulation.
"We have to get out of this deregulation disaster."
Parts censored
For months, Davis refused to make public details about the contracts, saying
that revealing information about the deals would put the state at a
disadvantage in contract negotiations.
The state became a major electricity buyer after the near-bankrupt utility
companies were unable to make purchases on their own.
This week, however, Davis agreed to release the contracts, with certain
portions censored. The governor's change of heart came as the newspaper
reports emerged and critics alleged that the state was overpaying.
A spokesman for Enron Corp. said yesterday that the state had many
opportunities to secure power at lower prices than it appears to have paid
under the contracts. Enron, however, declined to sell any power to the state
under contract.
Outside of court yesterday, Deputy Attorney General Tim Muscat said that the
state has secured enough contracts in the past month to feel comfortable
releasing long-term contract details.
The state has signed 61 contracts or agreements in principle that cover much
of the state's unmet electricity needs, he said.
"We have finally reached critical mass and now we think we can disclose the
contracts and still protect the public's interest in getting the best deal
and going forward with negotiating agreements," Muscat said.
But he added that the state wants to keep private some technical contract
information that could harm the state's contract partners.
Media opposed
"You are going to be looking at a contract that has 98 to 99 percent of the
content in it," Muscat told reporters gathered outside Quinn's San Diego
courtroom. "The only thing that could be removed are some technical issues."
Alonzo Wickers, an attorney representing the coalition of media
organizations, said he will oppose allowing the state to omit portions of the
contracts and will seek full information about spot market buys.
Wicker said that having complete access to the documents "is essential to the
public's full understanding of the contracts."
Wickers is representing the Copley Press, which publishes The San Diego
Union-Tribune; the Los Angeles Times; the San Jose Mercury News; the San
Francisco Chronicle; Dow Jones; the McClatchy newspapers; The Orange County
Register; Bloomberg, and The Associated Press.
Muscat had unsuccessfully sought 14 days to provide the documents to
plaintiffs. He said the state's business partners needed to have the
opportunity to raise objections to releasing the information. The contracts
contain confidentiality clauses.
Among those seeking a delay in the judge's ruling yesterday was an attorney
representing Morgan Stanley, a marketer in power transactions, who said he
had just learned of the litigation this week.
"Once the contracts are publicly disclosed, the eggs cannot be unscrambled,"
said attorney Eric Landau, who said his client's competitive position could
be hurt by the release of information.

NEWS ANALYSIS
Senate Democrats to Use Power to Illuminate Bush Energy Plan
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Political Writer
WASHINGTON--It was a sign of things to come when Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) bounded into the chairman's seat Wednesday to convene a
hearing on electricity price controls in the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
With their sudden ascension into the Senate majority, Democrats have
regained control of one of Congress' most effective weapons: the power to
summon witnesses to investigative hearings, backed by the authority to
subpoena documents. And that could signal a major shift in the debate on a
broad range of issues--energy policy foremost among them.
Though the Democrats lack a coordinated strategy, several committees
plan hearings through the summer and fall that will shine a sustained
spotlight on Bush administration energy policy decisions, and the role of
energy companies in rising gasoline and electricity prices. Through these
hearings, the Democrats hope to reshape the climate of public opinion around
the energy debate, pressure both federal regulatory agencies and private
companies to change their behavior--and score some political points by
painting President Bush's policies as a boon to the energy industry.
"What this allows us to do is continue some of the unpleasant
conversations that Bush is trying to avoid and that Bush could avoid in the
more controlled atmosphere when Republicans held the Senate," said one
Democratic strategist.
That prospect presents obvious problems for Bush, who already is
battling the perception in opinion polls that he favors producers over
consumers in the energy debate. But these inquiries also carry dangers for
Democrats, who spent six years charging that congressional Republicans
misused their investigative authority through repeated hearings into alleged
ethical misdeeds by the Clinton administration.
"The public doesn't want to see a party that's out for blood. If they go
down that path, the public will turn off just like it turned off on the
Republicans," said John Podesta, President Clinton's White House chief of
staff. "But what these investigations and oversight hearings can do is really
help tell a story about whose side this White House is on . . . and what the
impact is on real people's lives."
Senate Republicans wasted no time denouncing the hearings as a waste of
time. "Let me tell you what the name of the game is now: It's pure politics,"
said Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), who chaired the Energy and Natural
Resources panel until the Democratic takeover.
Asked about Wednesday's proceedings, he replied: "Is that going to
produce any more energy?"
Conscious of both the opportunities and risks, Democrats are moving
cautiously to exercise their new clout. Lieberman has not issued any
subpoenas in his investigation into California's power crisis, and his first
hearing Wednesday was a sedate affair that broke no new ground.
Still, the authority to investigate has always been one of Congress'
most potent tools, particularly when Capitol Hill and the White House are
held by different parties.
Over the last century, congressional hearings have largely divided into
three categories. One tradition centers on allegations of ethical wrongdoing
in the executive branch--such as the probes that unearthed the Teapot Dome
oil scandal during Warren G. Harding's presidency, vetted the Watergate
burglary that led to President Nixon's downfall or examined the Whitewater
land deal and campaign fund-raising during Clinton's presidency.
Hearings also have been used to look for misbehavior in the private
sector, usually as an attempt to lay the groundwork for reform legislation,
such as the Depression-era hearings on the stock market crash that led to the
creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And, finally, legislators have used the hearing forum as a competitor to
the president's bully pulpit--as a means to draw attention to ideas the White
House opposes. Probably the most successful example of that occurred in the
1960s, when nationally televised hearings by Sen. William Fulbright (D-Ark.)
on Vietnam crystallized opposition to the war.
During Clinton's presidency, Republicans emphasized ethics
investigations. So far, in the energy debate, Democrats are focusing on the
second and third categories.
"Hearings of the sort Lieberman is conducting aren't designed to disrupt
[like the hearings during the Clinton administration]; they are designed to
force new issues in the debate," said Johns Hopkins University political
scientist Benjamin Ginsberg, who has written extensively on the process. "As
long as the energy debate was conducted only inside the Republican Party, it
was a debate between proponents of free markets and proponents of freer
markets."
At Wednesday's hearing, Lieberman summoned half a dozen economists to
make the case for the price caps on electricity rates that California Gov.
Gray Davis supports and Bush adamantly opposes. Next Wednesday, Lieberman
will convene a second hearing that will give Davis a national forum to make
his case for price controls--th
