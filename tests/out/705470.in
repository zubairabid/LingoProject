Transwestern received a Compliance Order from the State of New Mexico, Air
Quality Bureau, for an outstanding turbine replacement activity at the P-1
C/S which occurred in 1996.   Transwestern had met with the AQB over this
issue in 1996 and assumed that the issue had been resolved, as no further
actions were received from the agency until this Compliance Order was
received. The issue in question was Transwestern's replacement of
interchangeable internal components from a 4700 turbine into the existing
smaller turbine (3505).  The larger internal components  (inlet guide
vanes/nozzles) which were placed into the 3505 were mechanically derated to
simulate conditions of the smaller turbine.  When Transwestern received
permit approval from the AQB to operate at the larger turbine capacity,
Transwestern made the upgrade adjustments and then operated at the higher
turbine value 4700.  The AQB did not understand that Transwestern could not
make the adjustments to the inlet guide vanes as any such activity by
Transwestern would void the warranty with Soalr Mfg.  Only Solar is
authorized to make adjustments to the turbine.  This prevents Transwestern
from randomly and arbitrarily manipulating and adjusting horsepowers of this
turbine at their descretion.
In the 1996 meeting with the AQB, Transwestern committed to conducting a
emissions test of the 4700 to determine if emissions were more or less than
the permitted values for the 3505.  It was shown that emissions from the 4700
were less than that permitted by the AQB for the 3505.  It should also be
mentioned that the 3505 was a regerative turbine and the 4700 is a simple
cycle.
Apparently, EPA has mandated that the AQB act on all issues considered to
be outstanding as determined by the EPA.  Dave Nutt has been sent the
Compliance Order to review.  Under the conditions of the Order, Transwestern
has 30 days to request another hearing.
Id like to have a group discussion to decide how Transwestern will manage and
handle this issue.  Would someone contact Anabelle and have her set up a
conference call for sometime next week?
