We tried all day to sell this volume below.  Market is extremely illiquid,
given Annex V uncertainty and other regulatory issues: generators believe
Parente will help them out in May, while LDCs look at their contracts and
reduced demand.  However AES Sul accepted to buy this volume at 25% discount
to May spot price, payment on June 25th.  We will net about R$600,000
(US$250,000) between sale and purchase prices.  Credit is OK.

We will keep a very small, long position at MAE settlement for May.
