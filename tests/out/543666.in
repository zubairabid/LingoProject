As a follow up to yesterdays Staff meeting I would like to implement the
following strategy on getting our "lists" in working order.

Each of the 5 working groups should appoint a lead for that group that will
be ultimately responsible for the list activity.
Origination and mid-market should work together to prepare 1 combined list.
Producer origination and producer mid-market should work together to prepare
1 combined list.
By next Monday (Feb 12) I would like to have the combined market list and
combined producer list identifying target customers and ENA responsibility.
By Monday (Feb 19) I would like to include Credit, EOL Registered, EOL
participation level, and existing business.  Select someone in the group to
work with credit and EOL on these issues.
The final list needs to be in the same format and available electronically.
Kim Brown will assist in this effort.
Over time each group may expand their working list as needed.



I appreciate your attention to this matter


Frank
