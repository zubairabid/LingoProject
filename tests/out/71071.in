Everyone,

The attached document outlines the Netco testing schedule for Monday, Feb 4th & Tuesday, Feb 5th.  There have been many decisions/ setup changes from the last test, and the majority of global data is now known.  This is the last week to test and validate before go-live.

The goals of the test are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Power Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)
2) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, including SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading session for on 2/7 (see below)
3) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.
4) pilot the (real) NetCo logins, and no longer the nc_t_xxxx logins.  As you recall, there can be start up menu issues with porting user ids.

Canada/ Portland/ Toronto
The NetCo terminal server ( <http://remoteservices.netco.enron.com>) will be available during this timeframe for your testing.
We have test scripts for Houston scenarios, but need your participation to develop scenarios for your area (ie CAD dollar scenarios).

Your input is needed by Friday noon (ASAP):
1) To confirm/ update the test participants on the attached schedule .  Please reply with others that will be testing.
Attachment Doc ' 0204 User_Test_ Schedule Netco.doc' -

2) Assist/ provide feedback with what global data setup is required.  Downtime from previous testing was largely due global data missing that was needed for processing.
Attachment Doc ' 0204 Global Data Setup requirements.doc' - development in progress, update to be provided later today.

The Bridgeline (800-711-8000 Code 3454709) will be open during the testing times. We request that all application owners be dialed into the bridgeline to expedite the resolution of any issues that might come up.

Thanks again for all your support.


FYI - The EOL business is planning a mock trading session tentatively scheduled for 2/7 (Thursday). The plan is to use the UBS production systems. The traders will be using the EOL Stack Manager and their own real products. The originators will be hitting the web site using valid counterparty accounts. It should last about 2 hours (probably 9am-11am).
