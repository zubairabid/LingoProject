I propose that we put in place the following plan to follow-up with employees:

1. Thank you from Stan to all employees that worked on emergency plan over the weekend.

2. Thank you from me/Steve Hotte to the group of employees that came into the office or went to Omaha & a small token of appreciation -- perhaps dinner certificate to take their families out to dinner.

3. Employee assistance - compile a list of ETS employees that need assistance & Gina will work with Missy Stevens in Corp. to coordinate assistance.
