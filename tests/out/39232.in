Attached is the list of people from our team who were given spots as part of our Business Continuity Plan. Please make sure you have the desk covered for this weekend by getting them to test their spot if they need to do business from the building. As mentioned yesterday we will not have access to our new desks until 5 AM Monday morning.
Tks and let me know if you have concerns, please note the testing times are listed below. Donna not sure how you will manage retail? Let me know.
