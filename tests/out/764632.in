Morgan,

I have to disagree with the "they were available by phone."  Being out of the office for "Team Building" on the last day of the month is inexcusable.  I tried calling Perry and there was no answer; he said he forgot and left his phone on vibrate.  The Omaha capacity people now carry text pagers that I can email info to; they have really improved their response.  The Houston staff needs these pagers too.  Capacity approval on TW is probably our weakest link in the process.  We really need your help to improve this or drastic action will be needed.  When I called at 3 pm to get a last second deal, I didn't get called back until 3:30 pm.  I was told they could be back in the office to approve the deal around 6 pm.  Well, even though I was here until 7 pm, Reliant wasn't going to be.  Perry said he could do it Saturday, once again, Reliant (or someone who can sign contracts) wasn't.  The TW Marketers, all of them, were also out of the office making EVERYTHING fall onto Contracts.  Why are we the only one's that need to be in the office?  I'm going to give this one more month and then, if everyone isn't working together on this, I'm going to Danny and tell him the Deal Capture team is off of TW since no one appears to give a rats ass (and this is after I've calmed down over the weekend).  Speaking to the Contract Group, this is far from the first time these guys weren't available.
