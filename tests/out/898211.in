Note that we will only reimburse up to the budgets provided by Travel Agency in The Park.  The employee should contact The MI Group for the budgeted amount and use TAP, if they are having trouble meeting the budget.

Tickets will be reimbursed for the H-B visa holder only.  Family members are not eligible, nor is any type of shipment for the H-1B holder unless they have an assignment letter covering additional relocation.
