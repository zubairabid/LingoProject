We need to communicate with Massey before he gets completely carried away
blaming the interstate pipeline business for gas price spikes.  We need to
get him the information regarding Cal LDCs failure to fill storage and their
opposition to additional pipeline construction in the state.  Shelley --
could you forward copies of the LDC filings to the group.  Should Joe or I
(or both) try to see massey when I am in town next week?
