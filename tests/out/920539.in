Subject: We Need You


Some of you were contacted earlier this year by Cliff Baxter, Enron's
representative on the Junior Achievement Board of Directors, regarding
participation in Enron's Junior Achievement program.  Since so many changes
have occurred within ENA since that time, we are renewing our request and
broadening it to reach more departments.

One of the programs that we wish to support through Junior Achievement is Job
Shadowing.  This program's objectives are to demonstrate why a sound
education, interpersonal skills, and a strong work ethic are needed to
succeed in the work place.  A successful Job Shadowing program requires your
department's commitment and participation.

The Job Shadowing program consists of the following:

9:00 - 10:30 AM  Welcome, Company Overview, Video, and Tour
10:30 - 12:00 N  Job Shadow Experience with Enron Employees and/or
Departments
12:00 - 1:00 PM  Lunch for Students with Mentors and Closing Comments

Enron has agreed to accept 16 high school juniors and seniors on the second
Wednesday of each month from October 2000 through April 2001.  We need your
assistance in hosting students within your department during the 10:30 AM -
12:00 Noon period.   Students may be either paired up one-on-one with
employees or may remain in groups of 2-4.  Employees participating in Job
Shadowing will also be invited to join their students for a quick lunch and
closing comments.  If enough departments participate, it is possible that
each department may only be needed on a quarterly basis.

Although we have identified two individuals to provide the company overview
and tour, we are also accepting additional volunteers in this area.  Please
advise if anyone in your department is interested in assisting.

Please provide the following information to Nicki Daw or Susan Skarness by
August 30, 2000.
