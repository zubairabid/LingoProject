At least one change was made on the mark-up that wasn't flagged in the
Summary.  In C.1.e; maintain records of the 'Core Procurement's' storage
activity, was changed to maintaining records for 'all storage accounts'.  Is
this because PG&E would consider Core Procurement to be just another storage
account?  If so, the original intent is still accomplished.  However,
although the Parties obviously thought there might at some point be value in
examining the historical info on the core's use of storage, I don't think
any of us would feel we ever would have any business examining data on a
third party's use of their negotiated storage account.
