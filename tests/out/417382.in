Hydro Quebec has forwarded to us their form of ISDA Schedule for the
referenced counterparty for review.  There is no indication of what Enron
business person is interested in this counterparty.  I will forward a copy of
the ISDA to Mr. "Canada" Suttle, and open a Lotus Notes entry with the
contact information.  We won't do anything until we receive a credit
worksheet from Credit.
