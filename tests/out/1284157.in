Thane -- I think word back from you is the next step needed in this process.  If ERCOT's position is that within the text of the Protocols, OOMC means "running", then unacceptable risks are presented to our Customer and to EPMI as their QSE.  If such is ERCOT's position, then they should cite us chapter and verse for that position within the Protocols, offsetting the clear implications for the contrary position in the Protocols' other ancillary services products, in the Operating Guides, the Market Guide, ERCOT's prior operating and marketing guides (predating this marketplace), and based on customary industry understanding of the term "capacity".  --David
