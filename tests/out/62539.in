Michelle,  Correct me on this one if I am wrong...

In the body of the email distributed yesterday afternoon it says that the form should be sent to Linda Guinn.  I believe she is in the legal department for Enron.  So I would assume she is the person who will track and report on who has and has not submitted their certification letter.
