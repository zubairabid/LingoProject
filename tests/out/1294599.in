Made contact with Meg Helma, Coral's in-house attorney today.  Learned that Coral is very keen to put together thye MNA and is getting outside counsel to clear conflicts so they can advise regarding validity.  We hope to have a copnference call with Coarl, their attorney, Antonoff and myself tomorrow or the next.  Meg and I have compared notes about the outstanding masters.
