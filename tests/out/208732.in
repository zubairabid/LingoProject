American Electric Power Buys Houston Pipe Line

American Electric Power Thursday announced it has made a major move to expand
its wholesale natural gas business in the Southwest, agreeing to acquire the
2.4 Bcf/d Houston Pipe Line (HPL) along with the Bammel storage field, one of
the largest storage fields in North America, from Enron. AEP said since some
details remain to be worked out, it was not disclosing the terms of the
transaction at this time. AEP will be acquiring the stock of HPL and it
expects to complete the deal in the next couple months.

HPL, one of the two original pipelines joined by Enron Chairman Ken Lay to
form the company in the mid-1980s, has an extensive 4,400 mile transportation
and gathering system through southern Texas. The 118 Bcf Bammel field,
located near the Houston Ship Channel market area, has a 65.7 Bcf working gas
capacity and is known for its fast in and out capabilities. It has a 1.4
Bcf/d peak withdrawal rate and a 365 MMcf/d injection capacity.

"Adding HPL to our natural gas asset portfolio will help us reach our goal of
becoming a top-10 gas trader and marketer," said Paul Addis, executive vice
president for AEP. The company currently is second in the U.S. in electricity
volume. "HPL will enhance AEP's natural gas business with its multiple
connections into the production areas of Texas, its numerous interconnects
with intrastate and interstate pipelines and its position in and around
Houston as a premier provider of natural gas."

AEP, headquartered in Columbus, OH, has numerous power generation plants in
the Midwest and Southwest, including a number of gas-fired plants in Texas.
In 1998 it bought the Louisiana Intrastate Gas (LIG) system.

John Olson, energy analyst with Sanders, Morris & Mundy in Houston, said "for
55 years HPL has enjoyed a reputation as one of the strongest pipelines in
the country. As a stand-alone operation it is first class. It's a very, very
strong asset." He said HPL has been showing losses of $50 million a year or
more in recent years, "but those numbers are meaningless" because Enron has
been using it at discounted transportation rates to underpin its marketing
efforts. Olson said the sale is a continuation of Enron's move to sell most
of its hard assets and become a soft asset player. "They are emphasizing
their trading. They are doing far better at trading."

For one Houston-based risk manager, the sale of HPL by Enron was a question
of rate of return. The competition among intrastates in Texas is fiercely
competitive and for gas delivered to the Houston Ship Channel it can be a
game of half-cents, with a shipper on one of the multiple intrastates
undercutting another to try to shave a profit, he said. Enron recognized this
and wanted out, he speculated.
