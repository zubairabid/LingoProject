I am (belatedly) compiling quotations on the California situation that
effectively make our points from the good or bad guys.  These type quotes can
sometimes be used in presentations.  My first quotation is the Gov. Davis
classic:
"If I wanted to raise prices, I could solve this problem
in 20 minutes."  (WSJ, March 8, 2001).
If anyone has some of their own classics, please forward them to me with a
full citation.  I will share what I come up with later on.
