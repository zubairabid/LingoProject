Environment
Amory Lovins, CEO (Research), Rocky Mountain Institute
"Natural Capitalism: The Next Industrial Revolution"
Introduction by Dean Laura Tyson
Wells Fargo Room, Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley

Amory Lovins, co-author of Natural Capitalism, will discuss how changes in
natural capital (the natural environment and ecosystems that support all
human and economic activity) are already affecting the way we do business,
and how leading corporations are gaining competitive advantage through
superior environmental performance. He will talk about how corporations can
employ advanced resource productivity strategies to move toward becoming
ecologically sustainable, reduce environmental impact, and improve the bottom
line.

Mr. Lovins is the co-founder and CEO (Research) of Rocky Mountain Institute
(RMI), a nonprofit organization that assists businesses, communities, and
governments to create more wealth and employment, protect and enhance natural
and human capital, and increase profit and competitive advantage through
resource and operational efficiency. The Wall Street Journal named Mr. Lovins
one of 39 people world-wide "most likely to change the course of business in
the '90s"; Newsweek has praised him as "one of the Western world's most
influential energy thinkers"; and Time recognized him with one of their Hero
of the Planet awards.
