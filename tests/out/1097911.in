Bjorn,
Vince forwarded your message to me.
I think it is a relatively easy task to achieve the synchronization with Houston's Exotica Options Library.
Just install Houston's Exotica.xll in London office, which will not take more than one hour.
We can routinely ship the excutable whenever we update the library for installation in London.
There are good reasons to do this:
1)  We make changes to Exotica frequently. In this sense, it is very hard to keep
ONE version across the company if offices outside Houston want to maintain their own
version.
2)  It is not necessary and cost effective to maintain different versions. As matter of fact, it is harmful
to have different versions. At the end of the day, it is Enron's P/L, different versions of Exotica would
produce a small difference in per unit basis, however, this difference could  be amplified to
a large discrepency due to the large trade volumes.
3) The London research plans to rewrite Exotica in C++. In our view, Exotica's routine is
small and self-contained, the objective programming will not add much value to it. While
it is nice to have a C++ version, but we think it should be assigned a low priority. We
are not moving to C++ any time soon in Houston.
Let me know if this answers your question. My phone number is 713-853-6388.
