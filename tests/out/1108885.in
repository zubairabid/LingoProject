The articles below provide excellent commentary on what we are up against.  Whether we like it or not history is littered with fallen empires and nations who have persecuted the Jews.  Israel, unlike us, at least until now, understands that it is in a war; a war for it's very survival; a war against those who openly state that they do not consider Israel to have the right to even exist.  But we know from the Bible that Israel will always exist and those who help the Jews, God will bless and those who hate the Jews, God will punish.  And even though we don't always agree with what Israel does, they are our friends, they know how to fight, and they are our allies in this War.

Israel knows they are in a fight for their very existence.  The same enemy of the Jews hates America.  They hate America and the West for the very reasons outlined in the article below.  They are and have been openly at war with us for years.  Every American better understand that now! And if we don't have the best intelligence service and the best armed forces in the world we are going to continue to pay dearly.  Several years before World War Two, MacArthur, while Chief of Staff of the Army, stated that there was nothing more expensive than a cheap army.  We can expand that today to include all aspects of national security to include an intelligence apparatus necessary to penetrate enemy organizations.  The additional challenge we face is in curbing the never ending desire for bigger and stronger government at the expense of freedom.  Can we as a people vote in statesmen rather than politicians to fill the ranks of government?

But above and beyond all of this is the fact that the Christian (those who believe in Jesus Christ - "faith alone in Christ alone" - for salvation) must understand that Jesus Christ does control history and no matter what happens on the historical scene He will take care of us both in life and in death.    With that said, we need to make sure that as many of these terrorists as possible meet "allah" very soon.
