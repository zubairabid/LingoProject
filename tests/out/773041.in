Lynn, I have resolved Tony Gee and Matt Martindale questions concerning this weekend storage allocation for the gas day June 23.

Matt was concern that Tenaska's Mid-17 contract 106171 was cut by our storage allocation the first time on Intraday 2.  In fact this contract received a small cut on the Non-Grid AM cycle.  Matt changed his nomination in the evening cycle to change some of his supply from Northern Border's Ventura to Mid-17 storage.  This nomination change will now be code as "incremental" on his storage contract 21229 for the remaining cycles.  Tenaska was able to avoid storage allocation cut on their IDD contract 21229 until Intraday 2 due to a "PRR" code for supply cut by Northern Border at Ventura.  Our storage allocation  only cut Tenaska Mid-17 path for gas delivered to their contract 21344 due to storage cuts downstream.  I have advised Matt  to be aware of these problems when changes nomination.

Tony Gee thought he was being "bump" or cut in the Intraday 2 cycle on his IT contract 5915 and FDD  contract 102835 on his supply from Northern Border's Ventura.  Prior to Intraday 2 we donot true-up storage allocation cuts until Intraday 2 with Northern Border.  Tony was only checking his nomination with Northern Border on his contract 5915 and seeing all his volume schedule to flow.  Tony failed to check his schedule volumes in Hot-Tap after the evening cycle to see his actual schedule volume was cut due to storage allocation.   Advised Tony to check his schedule volume in Hot-Tap after each cycle.
