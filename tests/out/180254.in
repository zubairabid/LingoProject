BYLINE: DON THOMPSON


DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Gov. Gray Davis signed a law Thursday letting the state borrow $13.4
billion
to pay for electricity for three cash-starved utilities.

Davis couldn't guarantee the 15-year bond will be enough to cover the
state's
electricity purchases. But he said the $13.4 billion price tag represents
''the
best thinking of our financial analysts,'' and includes a reserve in case
electricity prices remain higher than expected.

The state spent $1,900 per megawatt hour Wednesday as state grid operators
narrowly avoided a third consecutive day of blackouts, Davis said, reiterating
his call for federal price caps. Cooler weather helped the state avoid
blackouts
Thursday.

Wednesday's costs were a record or near-record since the state purchases
began in January, said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the power-buying
Department of Water Resources.

Davis said he hopes the state can stop buying power for Pacific Gas and
Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric by the end
of next year.

Davis accused Assembly Republicans of putting their political opposition
above the state's welfare by refusing to support the bond bill. That means the
bonds can't be issued for three months, which Davis said will drive up the
interest ratepayers will be charged for the bond.

''This measure is a lifeboat that allows us to stay afloat,'' he said.

In a statement, Assembly GOP Leader Dave Cox called the bond bill ''a
dangerous gamble for California a gamble Republicans couldn't support without
a
clear endgame ... The governor obviously believes that history will judge that
his was the right decision. He had better be right.''

Also Thursday, a federal bankruptcy judge considered ordering PG&E to make
millions of dollars in back payments to small power plant owners that provide
nearly a third of California's electricity.

And California power regulators continued struggling over how to divide
record electric rate increases among the 9 million customers of the state's
two
largest utilities, Edison and PG&E. The Public

tilities Commission is rushing to adopt the higher rates Monday.

HEADLINE: Colossal bond sale has big ifs

BYLINE: By Mike Taugher and Rick Jurgens

BODY:

WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis gave the go-ahead to the largest
municipal bond sale in U.S. history on Thursday amid questions about whether
it
would be enough to extricate the state from its energy mess.

Davis aides said the bond issue, which could go as high as $13.4 billion,
would be enough to finance high electricity prices over the next 18 months.
But
the state already has spent nearly $6 billion of that money during the past
four
months and at its current rate could end up spending $10 billion of taxpayer
money before it can sell any bonds to investors beginning in August.

But under an intricate plan designed by Davis and his advisers, the governor
says electricity costs will begin to drop dramatically in coming weeks and
months. The plan relies heavily on Californians to conserve electricity, and
assumes, among other things, that Southern California Edison stays out of
bankruptcy and that small, alternative energy firms will restart generating
units.

"Do a number of things need to come to be? Yes. Absolutely," said Joseph
Fichera, a financial adviser to the governor.

If the plan's assumptions hold true, it should be unnecessary for the state
to impose new electricity rate hikes or borrow even more money on the bond
market, according to Davis aides.

But critics, including Republican lawmakers and consumer advocates,
questioned whether those assumptions were realistic and condemned the decision
to borrow so much money as tantamount to a "blank check" to be backed by the
customers of the state's three largest electric utilities.

"This is not the end, by any means, of the energy spending," said Jamie
Fisfis, spokesman for Assembly Republicans. "There's no part of this that is
tied to an energy plan that has any credibility with anybody."

Republicans opposed the bond issue and prevented Davis from getting the
two-thirds majority he needed to issue the bonds immediately. Now, the
governor
will have to wait three months, a development that could allow generators who
have signed long-term electricity contracts to back out of those contracts or
increase the price California must pay until the bonds are issued.

That is because some of those contracts have provisions that allow
generators
to renegotiate with the state if bonds are not sold by a certain date.

"We are at risk," Fichera said.

The billions of dollars California borrows from investors will be used to
repay taxpayers for electricity purchases since January and to soften the blow
that extremely high wholesale prices would otherwise pose for customers of
Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &
Electric.

Investors who buy the bonds will be repaid through electric bills over the
next 15 years.

Among assumptions included in an analysis of the deal prepared by Davis'
advisers are expectations that Californians will reduce electricity
consumption
and that the average spot market price for electricity will drop to $230 per
megawatt-hour during the entire year of 2001 and drop to $185 next year. As
long-term contracts and conservation begin to take effect, the state will have
to buy less electricity on the spot market and prices will fall, the
governor's
team says.

By contrast, prices have been much higher than what the governor's plan
forecasts. The average price on the California spot market during the first
three months of the year was $346.

Davis also singled out Reliant Energy of Houston for criticism on Thursday,
saying the company charged Californians nearly $2,000 per megawatt-hour for a
relatively small amount of power as grid managers were trying to avoid
blackouts
a day earlier.

"That is an example of the extraordinary problem that we're dealing with,"
Davis said. "There is a huge transfer of wealth from California to Texas and
other parts of the Southwest."

The final bond deal will need to include a financial plan that generates
enough revenue for the state Department of Water Resources to fund its power
buys and make payments to bond holders, said Ray Murphy, an analyst for
Moody's
Investor Services, a credit rating agency.

The utilities could complicate those plans if they mount legal challenges to
how state regulators divert utility customer payments to the state. PG&E and
Edison already have objected to preliminary decisions by the Public Utilities
Commission that pave the way for the commission to send money to the state
that
the utilities contend they are owed.

Another risk looms in the background.

Because the money will be collected from electricity users by the state's
utilities, including bankrupt PG&E, there is at least a danger that some
creative lawyer for the utility's creditors will try to have a portion of the
revenue diverted into the company's bankruptcy estate _ the pot of assets to
be
divided up to pay off PG&E's debts.

That probably won't happen.

"It is believed that PG&E does not have any claim to the revenue that is
collected," said Murphy, the Moody's analyst.

Still, he noted that the bankruptcy judge has not ruled on that question.

HEADLINE: Energy Generators Plea to Quit California Electric Firm's Contracts

BYLINE: By Matt Sebastian

BODY:


SAN FRANCISCO--Alternative energy generators warned a federal judge Thursday
that Californians could be in for more dark days this summer if they're not
freed from unfavorable contracts with bankrupt Pacific Gas & Electric Co.

A group of four gas-fired co-generation facilities in the San Joaquin Valley
asked Judge Dennis Montali to cancel their contracts with the utility, saying
the utility owes them $ 58 million in pre-bankruptcy payments.

The generators' attorneys and lawyers for several other firms with similar
cases before the U.S. Bankruptcy Court warned that the power companies could
start shutting down again if they're not allowed to sell their electricity at
higher rates on the open market.

Two days of blackouts in March were blamed, in part, on the high number of
alternative generators, known as qualifying facilities, that went off-line
because they hadn't been paid. More than 300 QFs say they're owed nearly $ 1
billion by PG&E.

"At this date and time, the state of California needs every megawatt it can
get," said attorney Richard Lapping, who represents Calpine Corp., which PG&E
owes $ 267 million for energy produced by its QFs.

Because natural gas prices are so high and the price PG&E pays the
generators
for energy is so low under the contracts, the power companies argue they could
go bankrupt as well if they're not soon granted relief.

Attorneys for the generators told the judge that PG&E saves $ 284 million a
month by buying 2,500 megawatts of electricity -- enough to power 2.5 million
homes -- from QFs rather than buying it on the volatile market.

"If the stay's not lifted and we're paid a rate that doesn't cover our costs
we will financially fail," Bruce Leaverton, an attorney representing the San
Joaquin Valley plants, told Montali.

The judge grilled both sides, pointing out that the generators would still
be
trapped in unfavorable contracts had PG&E not declared bankruptcy. "Isn't that
the risk you bargained for?" Montali asked.

But he also questioned why PG&E insists on waiting months to decide whether
to keep or drop the QF contracts. That decision usually doesn't happen until a
bankrupt company files its reorganization plan.

The bankrupt utility, for its part, questioned the failing fiscal health of
the San Joaquin Valley generators, pointing out that they're half-owned by
Texaco.

"It's not a little guy who's about to go out of business," said Jim Lopes,
PG&E's lead bankruptcy counsel. "It's a big guy that doesn't like the terms of
his contract."

"I don't think we want to get into parentage," Montali quipped, referring to
accusations that PG&E's parent company, PG&E Corp., is profiting during the
utility's bankruptcy.

Montali delayed ruling on the QFs' motion until later this month in order to
give PG&E's attorneys time to respond to a last-minute motion filed by the
generators.

The judge may weigh in on the topic sooner than that, though, as more than a
dozen other alternative energy producers line up in similar attempts to drop
their contracts. Two such hearings are scheduled for next week.

HEADLINE: Davis raps GOP foes of power bond

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Gov. Gray Davis attacked Republicans yesterday as he signed a record $13.4
billion bond to repay the state general fund for power purchases, warning that
their opposition could harm the state budget and the California economy.

Davis threatened to travel to the districts of Republican legislators and
spell out how law enforcement, transportation, health care, education, and
senior programs may have to be cut because the bond money will not be
available
until August.

The governor also criticized three Republicans in Congress for voting
against
a proposal in committee yesterday to impose tighter federal controls on
wholesale power prices.

Assembly GOP Leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks predicted that Davis soon ''will
be
visiting up and down the state trying to get re-elected, that is why he using
fear politics, the blame game.''

The open partisan warfare erupted as Davis reported the incredibly high
price
the state paid for electricity Wednesday to avoid blackouts.

A spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which buys power on
behalf of the utilities, said the state paid Houston-based Reliant Energy Inc.
$1,900 per megawatt-hour for 168 megawatt-hours, costing a total of $319,200.

''If it's not a record, it's very close to it,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, a
department spokesman. ''No one can recall anything higher. But we haven't
delved
into all of the history.''

Hidalgo said the state purchased 300,000 megawatt-hours of electricity
Wednesday. The state has previously reported spending as much as $90 million a
day to buy power, but the total that the state spent for power on Wednesday
was
not available.

Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing
that generators would use the information to submit higher bids. Republican
legislators and a group of newspapers have filed lawsuits to force the state
to
release the information.

The state has been revealing rough totals of the power spending by
periodically notifying the Legislature that a $500 million increment will be
spent in 10 days.

On Monday, the Department of Finance notified the Legislature that the state
will begin spending another $500 million increment in 10 days. By that time,
the
state expects to have spent more than $6.7 billion buying power.

The total includes $5.9 billion from the general fund, $302 million from the
state Department of Water Resources budget, and about $545 million received
from
investor-owned utilities whose customers receive the power purchased by the
state.

The state began buying power for utility customers in January after Pacific
Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, whose rates were frozen under
deregulation as wholesale power costs soared, ran up a combined debt of about
$13 billion and could no longer borrow.

The $13.4 billion bond authorization signed by Davis yesterday is intended
to
repay the state general fund and provide some additional money for long-term
power contracts.

Republicans refused to provide the two-thirds vote needed for an urgency
measure allowing the bonds to be sold before the new state fiscal year begins
July 1. Assembly Republicans wanted a smaller, $8 billion bond, lowering
future
bills for ratepayers who will pay off the bonds over 15 years.

''I want people to understand that we are going to have to pare back
important programs in our budget since we won't have the cash on July 1,''
Davis
said. ''We will have the cash, best case, mid- to late August.''

The Assembly GOP leader, Cox, said a bipartisan deal on a bond could have
been reached if the governor and Democratic legislators had responded to the
Republican proposal and tried to negotiate an agreement.

Davis is scheduled to propose a revised budget Monday.

Meanwhile, a group of San Diego County businessmen said yesterday they plan
to ask county government to finance the purchase of 25 diesel generators,
capable of generating 2 megawatts apiece, to operate at large businesses that
don't have emergency generators.

Robert L. Simmons II, leader of the Coalition for Electricity Independence,
said the program could provide 50 megawatts of new generation by this summer
and
reduce the need for blackouts in San Diego County by cutting demand on the
grid.

Simmons is seeking $15 million in funding from the county Board of
Supervisors to finance acquisition of the equipment. Private funds also are
being raised, he said.

''We are asking our leaders to step up to the plate with action,'' said
Simmons, chief executive of Senior Aerospace Ketema in El Cajon, who said his
company would be willing to use one of the portable generators.

San Diego Gas & Electric last week announced a similar proposal. The company
wants businesses with existing generators to sign contracts agreeing to turn
them on and drop off the power grid when the region is in a power emergency.
Officials say that plan, which requires state Public Utilities Commission
approval, could provide 50 megawatts.

HEADLINE: California Crisis Reaches $22 Billion and Still Climbing

BODY:

Forecasts of the economic impact of California s power crisis continue to
climb, with the latest business-backed study claiming $22 billion of lost
productivity if California Independent System Operator projections of 100
hours
of blackouts are accurate. The ISO forecast also translates to statewide
household income reductions of $4.5 billion and job losses of 135,000,
according
to the study by the high-tech heavy California Manufacturers & Technology
Association(CMTA) and other business groups.

Each time electricity prices are hiked -- particularly if business is the
target -- damage from the blackouts is multiplied, said CMTA president Jack
Stewart. Part of the underlying motivation for the study is clearly a move to
"implement an equitable rate increase structure that encourages greater
conservation by residential and business users alike," Stewart said. The CMTA
study comes on the heels of work by AUS Consultants of New Jersey, a market
research firm, which concluded just last month the crisis would cause some $16
billion of lost productivity statewide. Against that backdrop, California
Gov.
Gray Davis is publicly claiming that independent generators such as Dynegy,
Reliant Energy, Mirant, and others are "making more money than God" and
sucking
the cash out of the state for coffers in Texas and other Southwest states.

Davis also blasted the Bush administration, saying the administration has
"utterly failed to discharge its responsibility" in the crisis, adding that
Vice
President Dick Cheney is "grossly misinformed" when it comes to California s
efforts to solve the situation. Because federal regulators have refused to cap
wholesale power prices, the California Public Utilities Commission has
proposed
that federal facilities including office buildings and military bases pay full
prices for real-time energy.

Under a plan by PUC president Loretta Lynch, rates will jump as much as 48
percent for residential consumers using 130 percent or more above 2000
baseline
levels; up to 45 percent for commercial customers; and as much as 52 percent
for
industrial users. The PUC is set to meet Monday to approve the rate design. If
approved, implementation is set for June 1, retroactive to March 27.

Separately, the California Senate approved sale of $13.4 billion in revenue
bonds to pay for electricity supplies. The average electricity consumer will
pay
an extra $2,000 over the next 15 years. Davis must sign the bill before it
becomes law. The state Assembly approved it recently .

Don't Write Off Davis Energy Plan

BYLINE: ALAN BLINDER, Alan Blinder, a professor of economics at Princeton
University, was, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve from 1994-96. He is the
senior, advisor to Saber Partners, which is advising Gov. Gray Davis on
energy,
policy

BODY:

Might Californians finally be seeing a dim light at the end of the energy
tunnel? This spring and summer will be difficult times unless everything
breaks
just right. But Gov. Gray Davis' recently announced energy plan offers at
least
short-run management of the crisis--and a hope for a long-run solution. And
that's about all anyone should ask the government to do.

Ignoring the history and some mind-numbingly complex details, the
electricity
problem comes down to this: Demand now outstrips supply by a wide margin even
on
a normal day, and by much more on days of peak demand. With the utilities no
longer credit-worthy, the state must fill the gap by buying on the wholesale
market. These days, that means buying high and selling low.

Any comprehensive attack on this problem must have three components:
mechanisms for reducing demand, mechanisms for increasing supply and a pile of
money to cover the bills while the medicine works. The governor's plan, while
not perfect, has the three elements. It also avoids the wackier suggestions
from
both the right and the left.

Let's work backward through the three components. First, the state needs
money to keep the lights on. One naive remedy would be to raise taxes to pay
all
the bills. No danger that any politician will ever latch onto that one. But a
related bad idea--raising retail electricity rates to cover all the
costs--does
have a following. Why is that a bad idea? Because the utilities are saddled
with
debt from the past. And things almost certainly will be brighter (pun
intended)
in the future.

Like a family, when a government is faced with a huge, one-time
expense--say,
to build a highway--it generally borrows most of the money. That's sound
financial practice because it spreads what otherwise would be a ruinously high
cost over time. Davis wants to spread the cost of the current crisis by
issuing
bonds worth about $12 billion to $13 billion, secured by future payments for
electricity. I do not know whether this is exactly the right number. But the
principle is clear, and it's too bad the Legislature delayed the bond issue.

Next comes supply. Wishful thinkers on the right have a simple solution:
Just
let retail prices rise, and more supply will come. The trouble is that it
won't,
at least not in the short run. Over years, greater supply is the only lasting
solution. But to expect much supply response in the short run is dreaming.

The left has its own favorite silly idea: The state should seize control of
power plants and take over the business of supplying electricity. Seize? How
much good would that do to California's business climate? And does anyone
really
believe that the state can, over the long run, generate and supply
electricity
better than private business? There are, in fact, traces of public ownership
in
the Davis plan: The state is buying transmission lines, and a new public
authority would build power plants if private industry fails to do so. But the
governor sees public ownership as a last, not a first, resort.

Finally, we come to the demand side, where true believers offer the same
remedy: Just let the retail price rise enough to cut demand back to the
available supply. Sound harsh? It is. Higher electricity prices must be part
of
the solution, at least in the short run. But relying exclusively on higher
rates
would be foolhardy and perhaps even ruinous to California's economy, because
titanic price hikes would be needed to cut demand by enough in short order. So
we would wind up inflicting pain on consumers without calling forth greater
generating or transmission capacity.

The governor at first resisted the conclusion that consumer prices had to
rise. But he has now embraced it. His package includes not just price hikes
for
big energy users, but also financial incentives for those who reduce
consumption. More can be done in this regard, but he is at least on the right
track.

Will these conservation measures get California through the next few months?
I wouldn't bet on it. But unless the federal government truly caps wholesale
electricity prices temporarily, demand management is about the only short-run
game in town.

Pray for a cool summer and for a lot more rain behind the dams in the
Pacific
Northwest.

NEWS ANALYSIS;
Bush, Rivals Don't Dare Ask Public to Make Sacrifices in Energy Crunch

BYLINE: RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

Amid their looming conflicts on energy policy, President Bush and his
critics
appear to have reached agreement on an unlikely point: Neither side is
preparing
to ask for significant sacrifices from the public to respond to rising prices
and squeezed supplies.

In the energy policy blueprint it will release next week, the administration
is expected to present enhanced production as the key to easing the energy
crunch. Democrats and environmentalists, in response, are stressing measures
to
prod manufacturers to design more energy-efficient products, from cars to air
conditioners.

But neither side is yet suggesting that ordinary Americans--whose average
energy consumption has increased steadily over the last 15 years--may have to
scale back lifestyles that increasingly include mammoth sport-utility
vehicles,
dawn-to-dark home computer use and new houses 50% larger than a generation
ago.

In fact, as the debate over Bush's plan approaches, both sides are working
overtime to insist that their solutions will allow Americans to use virtually
as
much energy as they want--without sacrifice.

In a striking declaration earlier this week, White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer portrayed unconstrained energy use as virtually an American
birthright. "That's a big no," he answered when asked if Bush believes
Americans
need to curtail their energy use. "The president believes that's an American
way
of life and that it should be the goal of policymakers to protect the American
way of life."

More surprising, environmentalists mobilizing to fight Bush's plan are
sending a similar message. "We don't need to sacrifice a lifestyle in order to
save energy," says Dan Becker, director of the global warming and energy
program
for the Sierra Club.

This improbable consensus reflects a deeper political calculation shaping
both sides' response to the energy challenge. After a decade in which American
life on almost every front--from energy to jobs to federal revenues--has been
defined by abundance, politicians have grown extremely reluctant to confront
voters with hard choices and unpleasant alternatives.

The big question is whether either side's preferred solutions can resolve
the
long-term energy problem without forcing Americans to face at least some of
those hard choices.

Compared to most issues, public opinion about the energy debate is unformed,
analysts in both parties agree. That's largely because few Americans have
thought much about the problem since the last gas lines disappeared 20 years
ago. "People aren't settled on what are the causes of the problem, let alone
what are some of the solutions," says pollster Mark Baldassare, a senior
fellow
at the Public Policy Institute of California.

As the struggle to shape public opinion begins, the central division is
likely to exist between Bush's emphasis on new production and the
Democratic/environmentalist push for greater reliance on renewable energy and
conservation. But that loud dispute threatens to obscure the remarkable
convergence on an equally important point: To the extent either side sees
conservation as part of the solution, they portray it primarily as something
done for consumers rather than by consumers.

White House aides say Bush isn't likely to completely ignore the value of
individual conservation; the Democratic energy alternative includes a
provision
that could eventually compel the government to discourage the use of vehicles
with poor fuel efficiency. But overall both sides are promising minimal
disruption--a stark contrast to the admission by California officials that
higher prices are needed to deter electricity consumption.

Indeed, it's telling that, instead of discussing conservation, both Bush and
his critics are increasingly talking about energy efficiency. That formulation
implies engineering strategies rather than lifestyle changes to reduce
consumption. "With technology, there's no reason why . . . you've got to live
in
the dark, turn out all the lights, don't enjoy the things that our modern
society brings you," Vice President Dick Cheney said this week.

Looming over these political and rhetorical calculations is the ghost of
President Carter, whose administration was plagued by repeated energy shocks
in
the late 1970s. When Carter unveiled his comprehensive energy plan just months
after taking office in 1977, his message hit a strikingly different note: The
crisis, Carter said, "will demand that we make sacrifices and changes in every
life."

Behind those words, Carter offered an agenda bristling with thorny ideas to
discourage energy use: new taxes on gas-guzzling cars, automatic taxes on
gasoline triggered when consumption rose too fast, utility reforms that
increased costs for the heaviest users.

But Congress rejected almost all these ideas, focusing instead on tax
incentives to encourage more efficient energy use, and Carter's efforts to
encourage voluntary conservation (like turning down the heat in winter)
became a
lasting symbol of weakness and ineffectuality.

Today strategists on both sides agree that the public is even less inclined
to sacrifice. And in that climate, neither Bush nor Democrats are focusing on
a
paradox central to the energy riddle: While most products have grown more
energy
efficient over the past generation, energy use per person in America is still
rising.

In the immediate aftermath of the 1970s oil shocks, per capita U.S. energy
use declined by roughly 8% from 1973 through 1985. But as the memory of those
disruptions faded, energy use per person increased almost 10% from 1985
through
1999, according to the federal Energy Information Administration.

On several fronts, it appears the demand for bigger energy-intensive
products
is offsetting the efficiency gains of improved technology. Take homes. In an
April study, the National Assn. of Home Builders concluded that because of
such
innovations as greater use of insulated windows and more efficient furnaces,
new
homes today use energy twice as efficiently as they did 30 years ago. But
despite those improvements, the overall trend among new homes is toward
greater
energy consumption.

In the first years after the 1970s oil shock, average fuel efficiency for
all
passenger vehicles in America steadily increased, peaking at 25.9 miles per
gallon in 1987. Since then average fuel efficiency has declined, dropping to
24
mpg in 2000, the lowest it has been since 1980, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency.

Some analysts think both sides are selling the public short by exempting
them
from sacrifice in the growing energy debate. "Americans have heard messages
about changing their ways and have been accepting when it comes to
conservation," says Baldassare.

But the dominant instinct is to target other causes--and solutions--for the
challenge, with Bush blaming environmental restrictions that have blocked
drilling or new power plant construction and Democrats pointing fingers at oil
companies, car manufacturers and the administration's links to both.

"Nobody wants to be in a position of telling the American public they can't
have what they want," acknowledges one top Bush political advisor.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY CRISIS;
;
House Committee Rejects Electricity Price Controls;
Strategy: In a blow to California's governor, Congress signals it won't rein
in
soaring costs.

BYLINE: GREG MILLER, RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

In the first test of congressional sentiment on California's power problems,
a House panel on Thursday rebuffed an effort by Democratic lawmakers to
legislate price caps on wholesale electricity.

The proposal, voted down 20 to 12 by the House energy and air quality
subcommittee, would have required the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
impose price controls keyed to the cost of generating power.

The Republican-controlled panel went on to approve a bill containing a
number
of less aggressive energy crisis measures, such as allowing California to
relax
environmental restrictions on power plants and extending daylight saving time
to
reduce evening electricity consumption.

But the vote on price controls, which split largely along party lines, was
the most contentious issue addressed by the subcommittee. Although price cap
advocates are expected to press their campaign at least twice more in the
House,
Thursday's vote was a significant setback. It signaled that Congress is not
inclined to rein in soaring energy prices, despite repeated pleas from Gov.
Gray
Davis and other state officials to do so.

Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), who offered the price control measure
as an amendment to the energy bill, argued that it would protect consumers
from
price gouging while preserving "reasonable" profit margins for power
suppliers.

Without price controls, he said, the bill "does not do for California what
we
need, and it does a lot of things for our state we don't want."

But the other three Californians on the subcommittee--all
Republicans--disagreed, and voted against Waxman's amendment, saying they
believe price controls would exacerbate the problem by discouraging investment
in new sources of energy.

"I recognize there's tremendous political pressure on us, but do not believe
it's the right thing to do," said Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs).

She was joined in voting against the measure by Reps. Christopher Cox
(R-Newport Beach) and George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa). The three California
Republicans ensured the amendment's defeat, because one Democrat who voted
against the measure, Rep. Ralph M. Hall of Texas, said he would have supported
it if all of the California members of the subcommittee had done so.

In Sacramento, Davis lashed out at Bono, Cox and Radanovich for opposing
price caps.

"I find it very surprising that people here in California experiencing this
crisis can go back to Washington and vote against the best interests of
constituents of this state," Davis said.

Waxman indicated he would attempt to revive the price cap amendment when the
bill is taken up by the full House Energy and Commerce Committee.

A final test could come later this month, when the full House is expected to
vote on the bill. Four California Republicans who are not on the energy
committee have already signaled they would support a price control amendment.

Thursday's vote was the first congressional action directed at California's
energy crisis, and underscored the extent to which the center of political
debate on the issue is shifting from Sacramento to Washington.

Next week, the White House plans to unveil a comprehensive national energy
strategy. The plan is expected to emphasize long-term solutions, ranging from
new oil exploration in Alaska to construction of hundreds of new power plants
and refineries.

With California experiencing rolling blackouts and gasoline prices surging
nationwide, the White House has become increasingly sensitive to criticism
that
its plan won't provide much immediate help.

At a news conference Thursday, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stressed
that "the president's focus is going to be on doing everything he can for all
terms: short-term, medium-term and long-term."

House Republicans attending Thursday's subcommittee session were careful to
endorse the administration's position that the federal government's ability to
help California in the short term is limited.

"We can't make it rain. We can't make it snow. We can't make it cool in Palm
Springs," said Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas), sponsor of the emergency bill and
chairman of the subcommittee.

Still, he said, Congress can provide some assistance. Barton's bill, which
was approved 17 to 13 by the subcommittee, contains more than a dozen
provisions
designed to curb consumption and enhance power supplies.

Some of the key provisions would:

* Authorize California's governor to waive some emission requirements on
natural gas-fired power plants on "emergency" days of high demand. Democrats
said Davis hasn't sought such discretion, and the measure is unlikely to help
because environmental regulations have not hindered power generation.

* Allow energy users to resell some of the electricity they are entitled to
consume but don't. Republicans said this would create a financial incentive to
conserve, but Democrats said they fear it would undercut existing state
programs
that reward conservation.

* Allow some power suppliers to suspend contracts with financially strapped
utilities. The measure is designed to enable companies that have cut off
supplies for lack of payment to cut new deals with other utilities or users.

* Require federal facilities in states where electricity emergencies have
been declared to curb their consumption by at least 20% compared with a year
earlier.

* Permit California to extend daylight saving time beyond October.

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY CRISIS;
NEWS ANALYSIS;
Power Rescue Plan Rests on Many 'Ifs'

BYLINE: NANCY VOGEL, RICH CONNELL, ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

BODY:

The success of Gov. Gray Davis' plan to end California's energy crisis rides
on assumptions that, if wrong, could lead to billions of dollars in runaway
costs for taxpayers.

Davis, who signed a historic $13.4-billion bond measure Thursday to finance
the plan, has refused to release key data and presented a single model for how
California will buy electricity--and pay for it--over the next 15 years.

If Davis and his cadre of financial advisors are right, the state will
emerge
from the most ominous period of the crisis in less than two years, flush with
cash and the prospect of electricity rate cuts. By then, the hope goes, the
power suppliers Davis has vilified will be reined in.

If his predictions are off by modest margins, which even many state
officials
and energy experts say is likely, the state may have to employ tactical
blackouts to control costs, siphon money that could be used for other
services,
go deeper in debt or raise electricity rates above the record increases of
this
year.

The governor's plan largely rests on these crucial assumptions: that
consumers will conserve a record amount of power at peak usage times, that
energy prices will drop precipitously, and that the state will lock in far
more
contracts for long-term power. But those three assumptions could prove faulty,
according to government financial records and interviews with state officials,
Wall Street analysts and energy experts.

Davis is banking on that troika to quickly tame the wild prices of
last-minute power--which hit an apparent record of $2,000 for a megawatt-hour
Wednesday. Such purchases so far have put the state on the hook for $6 billion
and pushed major utilities to the brink of ruin.

Davis' plan assumes that the state will reduce peak demand by 2,484
megawatts--enough to supply nearly 2 million homes--through three programs run
by the California Independent System Operator, which keeps power running to
homes and businesses across the state.

But Cal-ISO managers say they will be lucky to achieve a fraction of that
savings this summer.

They say that one of the programs listed in the governor's plan was shelved
because regulators had raised concerns about air pollution. Another, aimed at
businesses, is likely to yield only about half of the 600 megawatts the
governor
has assumed will be saved when supplies are tight this summer, said Cal-ISO
Project Manager Bill Wagner.

"There's a lot of 'ifs' in there," he said of the conservation program,
which
would pay businesses to cut back during critical hours. He said the utilities
are months behind in installing meters to measure the savings.

Officials at another state agency in charge of a similar conservation
program, the Public Utilities Commission, also said they are not sure about
hitting targets on which the bond plan is based.

PUC Senior Analyst Robert Strauss said he has no idea how many businesses
will agree to curtail electricity consumption in exchange for cheaper power
rates this summer. The program is only a month old, he said.

"We're in a new situation that we don't have good experience with," Strauss
said. "Who's going to sign up for these programs? We don't really know."
Another
program that Davis hopes will conserve 1,600 megawatts has attracted interest
from just two businesses since March.

"It's pretty ambitious to think we're going to get 1,600 megawatts by June
in
that program," said Cal-ISO's Wagner.

Beyond Davis' assumptions about conservation, the success of his hard-fought
bond measure relies heavily on how much the state will pay for electricity
during the next two summers. If the price is higher than forecast by Davis,
the
bond money could be consumed more quickly, potentially forcing the state to
borrow more, dip into tax funds or raise customer rates again.

To keep prices down, the Davis administration has struggled to lock up in
contracts most of the peak-hour power needed for the next two summers to avoid
premium, eleventh-hour prices.

In his effort to push his bond legislation through the Capitol, he has
suggested that about 50 such contracts will be signed to produce half of the
peak demand the state needs. And that, his advisors say, doesn't count other
contracts they think will materialize.

So far, the administration has fallen far short, achieving final agreements
on only 28 contracts as of Thursday.

If that gap persists, the state will probably be forced to buy electricity
on
the expensive spot market, which could eat into the bond money.

"I think the operative word is uncertainty," said Paul Patterson, an energy
analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston. "There are too many pieces, [and] all
you need is for one or two of those not to work out substantially and things
change."

Patterson, who says he remains cautiously optimistic about the governor's
plan, was among a group of Wall Street analysts who were briefed last week by
Davis' top advisors.

Some wondered about who would provide the additional power that Davis had
incorporated into his plan. Others questioned whether investors would buy the
bonds with so many assumptions built into the measure.

During the briefing, the governor's advisors said one option being
considered
is to refuse to pay the highest prices for power and "accept some sort of
rolling blackout scenario."

One of the governor's chief energy consultants, Joseph Fichera, told the
Wall
Street analysts that if suppliers think they can profit by holding back power
until the threshold of blackouts, the state may simply say no, leaving them
with
no sale.

Through calculations that include contracts and conservation, Davis'
advisors
arrived at another assumption that has drawn skepticism. They insist that the
purchase of any power not under contract will average just $195 per
megawatt-hour this summer--helping slash overall power costs by hundreds of
millions.

Critics say the California market is simply too volatile to forecast. Before
Tuesday's blackouts, for example, prices on the last-minute market had been
below $800 for a megawatt-hour, a considerable amount. But not as much as it
was
Wednesday when the state paid Houston-based Reliant Energy $2,000, Davis said
Thursday.

A report by Republican Assembly members concluded that if Davis' assumption
that non-contracted power will average $195 is off by just 10%, electricity
would cost an additional $250 million by September. Over two years, those
additional costs could soar to $1.1 billion, the GOP study found.

Democratic state Controller Kathleen Connell, whose staff has attempted to
analyze the governor's report, is warning that rising power costs could tear
through the bond funds and possibly expose the state's general fund.

Connell accused the governor of tailoring his assumptions and numbers to
neatly fit his goal of assuring the public--and Wall Street--that an end to
the
crisis is near.

Fichera, who helped prepare the report, insists that the
administration's bond plan is conservative and presents the most reasonable
scenario of the converging forces of conservation and prices.

Even if things do not fall into place, Fichera said, there is an extra $1
billion packaged into the measure, along with an expectation of billions more
in
later years to cover any shortfalls.

"Any realistic scenario," Fichera said, "we believe we have the resources to
cover."

Fichera said he sees only a slim possibility that power costs in the next
two
years could outpace the available bond money, forcing the state to borrow
more.
He said such a loan could easily be paid back by the recent utility rate
increases, which would cover both dropping costs of power and the bonds within
the next three years.

Fichera declined to provide The Times with figures showing at what point
higher power costs could consume the cushion he said is built into the
governor's plan. Public officials and newspapers, including The Times, have
sued
the administration for more details about the state's power costs.

But Davis and his consultants say key financial information must be kept
secret to prevent energy traders from gaining more leverage in the state's
power
market.

But that confidence was tempered in a state document given to Wall Street
analysts that recently accompanied an unrelated bond issue.

The document acknowledged that the assumptions underlying Davis' financial
plan to restore stability to the California electricity market were "subject
to
many uncertainties." "There can be no assurance," the document concluded,
"that
there will not be future disruptions in energy supplies or related
developments
which could adversely affect the state's economy."



Making Assumptions

Gov. Gray Davis' energy rescue plan, financed by a $13.4-billion bond
measure
he signed Thursday, rests on several questionable assumptions. Key among them:

CONSERVATION: California businesses and residents will cut more than 7,200
megawatts from peak demand this summer. That is about one-sixth of the height
of
demand on a hot August day.

PRICES: Conservation and new energy sources coming online soon will create
downward pressure on California's wholesale electricity market, causing the
average prices the state pays for power to drop sharply.

CONTRACTS: The state will finalize about 50 long-term contracts for power
that will cover the expected shortfall in electricity expected this summer
during periods of the highest energy use. So far, the state has only 28 signed
contracts.

Restarting of 2 Generators in O.C. OKd;
Energy: State panel grants a 10-year run for the AES Corp. units despite
concerns of Huntington Beach officials and residents.

BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Granting the governor's wish that power plants receive speedy approval, the
California Energy Commission cleared the way Thursday for the restart of two
idled generators that will double the output of a plant in Huntington Beach.

The vote came despite concerns from city officials and nearby residents that
potential environmental and health risks associated with the restart were not
adequately examined by regulators.

The commission's action allows AES Corp. to run the two controversial units
for at least 10 years, provided that a midterm review finds that operators are
taking steps to limit any harm the plant may cause to seawater quality and
marine life.

The commission also required the company to sell all the power generated by
the units, enough to supply about 337,500 homes, within California--a
restriction unprecedented in the state.

Some attorneys questioned whether the panel had the legal authority to place
such a restriction. But Commissioner Robert Laurie said that while the limit
"may not be good long-term policy," the state's power emergency warrants it
now.

The commission's unanimous vote capped weeks of arduous negotiations
involving AES, the state and Huntington Beach officials, who called the
10-year
permit "a major disappointment." AES officials pushed for the 10 years on
grounds that a shorter time frame made the economics of the project iffy.

City officials preferred a five-year permit, noting that the company's track
record--it once paid a $17-million fine for allowing too much pollution to
spew
from its Long Beach plant--raises doubts about its future performance. The
commission's staff also favored five years, with the possibility of a
five-year
extension.

"They have not exactly been great corporate citizens," Matt Lamb, project
manager for Huntington Beach, said of AES. "This is a grossly inefficient
plant
that has been mothballed and they're basically kick-starting it. We don't
think
it deserves 10 years."

But Gov. Gray Davis--who has publicly pushed the commission to approve
plants
quickly--hailed the decision. "That's good news. That's supply we're counting
on," he said.

The two Huntington Beach units are 40 years old and have been idle since
1995. But the energy crisis has made the old valuable once again, and AES
plans
to invest $150 million to repower the generators--once scheduled for
demolition.

The units represent almost 10% of the 5,000 megawatts Davis has said he
would
bring into service this summer to avert an electricity shortage. Recent
estimates, however, suggest the governor's pledge was overly optimistic.

Time Frame Still Uncertain

And while both Davis and the Energy Commission are expecting the Huntington
Beach project to come on line in August, AES Southland President Mark Woodruff
said Thursday that it's unclear whether the units would be up and running that
soon.

The AES project is among a handful receiving fast-track approval under the
governor's executive order earlier this year requiring expedited review of
such
plants. It's the first restart to be approved.

In normal times, a 450-megawatt project such as the one approved Thursday
might have taken a year's worth of study, public hearings and other scrutiny,
said Claudia Chandler, a commission spokeswoman. Today's expedited review
shrinks that to just 60 days.

That clearly rankles some Huntington Beach residents, who, in testimony
before the commission, wondered whether emissions, ocean pollution and other
threats had been thoroughly studied.

"I think it's almost outrageous what's being foisted on the public," said
Rich Lloyd, who lives about a quarter mile from the plant. "What relief are
you
going to give to all these people, all these schoolchildren, who have to
breathe
these emissions for 10 years?"

Huntington Beach Councilwoman Shirley Dettloff said she too was troubled by
the fast-track licensing process. "We're taking a risk as a city," she said.
"If
a price has to be paid, our citizens will be paying that price."

Critics are alarmed by a UC Irvine study concluding that the plant--which
now
uses and discharges about 300 million gallons of seawater each day as
coolant--may combine with ocean currents to attract sewage released miles
offshore. Many residents suspect the plant contributed to pollution that
caused
repeated beach closures in 1999.

Acknowledging the concerns, the commission required AES to spend $1 million
to study whether water quality is at risk. The company also must spend
another $
2.5 million to monitor fish deaths caused by its seawater intake system. If
too
many white croaker, queenfish and other species become trapped and die, AES
may
be required to modernize its equipment, commission officials said.

Other complaints have focused on the noise, smoke and smells produced by the
plant. Jane Riley, who lives nearby, plans her outings with son Daniel, 6,
around the thick clouds of yellow-brown smoke that are a part of everyday
life.

"I try to avoid it. I take a look at which direction it's going," Riley
said.
With two more units fired up, a bad situation will only get worse, she fears.

In other action Thursday, the commission approved a 95-megawatt "peaker"
plant in the Central Valley city of Hanford. Peaker plants can produce large
amounts of power in short bursts, and the governor is counting on such
facilities to make up about 40% of California's electricity deficit this
summer.

HEADLINE: House Moving to Ease California Power Crisis

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 10

BODY:

With members of Congress stepping up the partisan fight over California's
energy crisis, the House moved today toward passage of a bill that Republican
sponsors said would increase the supply of electricity in California but would
not impose the energy price caps sought by Democrats.

The bill, which would allow for an easing of clean-air laws to keep power
plants in service and would simplify rules allowing the federal government to
sell its power to the state, was approved 17 to 13 in an energy subcommittee.
The vote, which was along strict party lines, moves the bill to the full
Energy
and Commerce Committee.

The vote came after a debate in which lawmakers made clear that they sensed
both political danger and political opportunity from the crisis that has led
to
rolling electricity blackouts across California, the nation's most populous
state. The situation is expected to worsen with the arrival of the summer
heat.

Democrats tried to place much of the blame for the crisis on the Bush
administration, which they said had done little to alleviate the electricity
shortage. "Have a tough summer -- that's the message from the Bush
administration," said Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of
Massachusetts. "The message is, 'Help is not on its way.' "

Republicans said that the Democratic governor of California, Gray Davis, and
the Democrat-controlled State Legislature were responsible for the energy
shortage because they failed to act earlier to negotiate long-term contracts
for
electricity.

Representative George P. Radanovich, Republican of California, defended the
Bush administration and federal energy regulators as he took aim at Governor
Davis.

"It's not the lack of federal involvement that's caused this problem," Mr.
Radanovich said. "It was really the mismanagement of this issue for the past
year by the governor and the State Legislature in California. That's what
brings
us here."

For his part, Governor Davis released a letter in Washington in which he
insisted that he was "doing everything I can in my state to remedy the energy
crisis," noting that no major power plants had been built in California in the
12 years before he took office, when the state's governors were Republicans.

The letter to the subcommittee asked that the bill under debate today
include
an amendment that would cap the price of wholesale electricity to prevent
price-gouging that could drive utility companies to bankruptcy.

"The current structure is allowing energy suppliers to charge excessive,
unwarranted rates for wholesale energy," he said. "States do not have the
authority to regulate wholesale interstate energy prices; that power falls
within the sole jurisdiction of the federal government."

But the subcommittee rejected the governor's request, defeating an amendment
from Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, that would have
capped wholesale prices in Western markets for 18 months.

Representative Billy Tauzin, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the
Energy and Commerce Committee, said that price caps would "do nothing, not one
single thing, to get one additional watt of electricity to California when it
needs it most." He said that price limits would worsen the crisis because they
would "justify every utility and municipality in the West holding onto their
reserves for their own customers."

At the White House, President Bush's spokesman, Ari Fleischer, said that the
president remained "worried about energy prices" and that he would "remain
vigilant to make sure there's no price-gouging." Next week Mr. Bush is
planning
to release a national energy blueprint that is expected to call for more oil
and
gas drilling and the construction of new power plants.

The bill approved by the subcommittee would allow Governor Davis to waive
some clean-air regulations to keep more power plants in service during peak
hours this summer, and would force the federal government to make further cuts
in energy use in federal offices in California.

HEADLINE: A Conservation Countdown

BYLINE: By BARBARA WHITAKER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 9

BODY:

To understand what California is up against in its search for enough
electricity to get through the summer, look no further than Michael Chroman,
owner of Brooklyn Hardware in East Los Angeles.

In the months since the energy crisis began, he has not changed the way he
does business or the way he lives.

"I guess I think it's pretty much contrived," Mr. Chroman said of the
shortage. "I think it's something they want to do to increase the rates, and
they'll do it whether I conserve or not."

As for the rising rates, "I can afford it, I guess," he said, as he loaded
beverages into his Jeep Grand Cherokee outside a local Costco.
