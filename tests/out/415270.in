Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict
Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going
forward basis.  To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based
counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power.
This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us
evidence of their FERC licensing.
