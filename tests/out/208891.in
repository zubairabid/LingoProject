The following network changes are being planned for EOL:

Feb. 3  Saturday From 9:00 am - 11:00 a.m.,
Enron Network Services will be upgrading the EOL UUNET network connection
(one of Enron's ISP) from 12Mbps to 27Mbps. Because UUNET is not the primary
EOL link, the outage is not expected to impact many of the EOL users.
However, if users have their connection configured to UUNET as their
preferred ISP, they may have to reconnect and may experience intermittent
outages during this maintenance.

Feb. 3  Saturday From 11:00 a.m. - 12:00 p.m.,
Enron Network Services will be upgrading the EOL Internet network switches.
A total outage of EOL is expected.  The outage should last approximately 30
minutes.

Please notify Jean McFarland or Mary Vollmer if you have any questions.
