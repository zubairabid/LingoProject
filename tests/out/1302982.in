Dear Mike,

Please see the link above for documents under 40 CFR PART 81.

I just spoke with Jeff, and he agreed that the best route would be to contact EPA re: areas that you are note sure of their attainment status.

Please send me the areas that you are ensure of and I will look into it.

As for other states that are pursuing bills to limit emissions trading - CT was pursing this for a while, but it has cooled down a bit in the press.  I will look into this, as well as KT and Maine.

Please call with any questions.

Talk to you soon,

Lisa
