Settle This
Which technology resolves disputes best?
March 20, 2001 issue

St. Louis retiree David Hubert couldn't have been happier to score a replica
of a $3,000 Charles Eames leather chair on eBay -for only $450. When it
arrived, he tore open the box, pulled away the bubble wrap, and immediately
sunk into the chair to ease his bad back. "As soon as I sat in it, I could
tell...whoa, this isn't right," he says. "It had a bad mildew smell-I mean, a
really bad mildew smell." Distraught, Hubert emailed the seller to demand
that he either pay to clean the chair or take it back. The seller refused.
"He basically stonewalled me," Hubert says. So Hubert filed a grievance with
SquareTrade, a San Francisco-based startup that helps resolve disputes on
eBay.

A SquareTrade online mediator-a real person who corresponds with both parties
via email-immediately began negotiations. After a week of back-and-forth, the
seller finally agreed to send Hubert $150 to have the chair cleaned. Hubert
and the seller never were in contact. "I think it went really smoothly,"
Hubert says.

Mediation has been a popular alternative to lawsuits to resolve disputes,
especially those involving small amounts of money. For businesses, conflicts
between state and international laws have made dispute resolution costly, no
matter how big the transaction.

With $657 billion changing hands through Internet transactions worldwide, it
comes as little surprise that a raft of new dot-coms plans to move the
mediation process further online. Everyone expects online mediation to grow
as the number of transactions conducted online continues to grow. "Regardless
of the market fluctuations and a fair amount of blood on the street,
ecommerce is here to stay and is growing at a steady pace," says Steven
Abernethy, president and CEO of SquareTrade. "There is wealth of commerce
online to keep us and others busy for a while."

The American Arbitration Association estimates that dispute resolution is a
$200 million-a-year industry, but there's no way to know how much of that
would migrate online. "I'm not sure it would necessarily shift," says
association spokesperson Toni Griffin. "Online transactions may simply
generate more disputes, which would grow the whole market." American
Arbitration-the largest dispute resolution company with 140,000 cases per
year as of 1999 and $65 million in annual revenue-recently announced its own
online mediation business.

Online mediators agree that easier dispute resolution will drive faster
adoption of ecommerce by businesses and consumers, many of whom may now avoid
online transactions for fear of getting hosed. According to Forrester
Research, two-thirds of businesses say they would not conduct an online
transaction with a party they don't already know.

What they can't agree on is how to use technology to resolve disputes. Some
companies, such as SquareTrade, eResolution, or Online Resolution, have had
experience resolving disputes. They are mediating disputes online simply by
substituting an online chat session or email for the conference table or
telephone. But a few upstarts say these companies aren't harnessing new
technologies that allow mediation to be automated.

"This is not as simple as slapping up a Website," sniffs Charles Brofman,
president and CEO of Mount Kisco, N.Y.-based Cybersettle.com. He doesn't
mediate disputes but offers an automated blind bid system to negotiate
settlements when liability has already been established. Here's how it works:
The aggrieved party enters a demand; the liable party enters the most it will
pay (Neither side sees the other's entry, hence the term blind bid.) If the
numbers are within 30 percent of each other, the software automatically
splits it down the middle and settles the claim. For each dispute, the
parties get three tries, after which they must start over if their entries
still haven't come within 30 percent. The company says the site can handle as
many as 10,000 simultaneous sessions per second.

Brofman says he has signed insurance companies to flat-rate subscription
plans in which Cybersettle offers discounts for a certain number of claims
per year. "This system just takes all of the ego and personality and whittles
it down to what it should have been-settling the claim," he says. That's
especially important, he says, for international disputes in which cultural
differences can muddy an otherwise objective claims process.

Rival clickNsettle.com offers a service similar to Cybersettle's, but doesn't
limit parties to three bids per cycle. Instead, it uses a monetary
disincentive to stop parties from gaming the process. ClickNsettle doesn't
set a bid limit, but charges a small fee for every settlement offer made. CEO
Roy Israel says the fees are just annoying enough to keep parties from
wasting bids on outlandish demands. "It eliminates the ridiculous," he says.
"It keeps someone from asking for millions of dollars. It causes people to
get real-real quick. No one wants to waste $100 on bids that don't go
anywhere."

Israel criticizes Cybersettle's three-bid process, calling it inflexible
because it "artificially terminates" the process even when parties haven't
settled. And as you might expect, Brofman is equally skeptical of
clickNsettle's unlimited bid system. "If you go to infinity, people just try
to game the system," he says. "And once insurance companies realize you can
game the system, they're not going to use it."

His clickNsettle.com was called National Arbitration and Mediation for eight
years before adopting a dot-com moniker last year. "We're not just an
Internet startup trying to capitalize on dot-com hysteria," Israel says.
"We're a mediation business evolving into a Web-enabled business." In fact,
its existing mediation infrastructure allows the company to give users the
option of moving disputes offline if necessary.

The question is whether either Cybersettle or clickNsettle-or any of the
other mediation sites-will catch on. "I'm skeptical of these automated
mechanisms," says Forrester analyst Charles Rutstein. "It's a little too
'Let's-let-the-machines-do-it.'" He wonders whether all the messaging
back-and-forth makes sense for many disputes that could be easily settled
using traditional means. "Just pick up the friggin' phone," he says.
