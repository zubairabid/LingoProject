E-tag 1.7 Source and Sink Registration

The North-American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) has scheduled the implementation of E-tag 1.7 for April the 10th. One of the many enhancements in E-Tag 1.7 is the attempt to eliminate typographical errors. Therefore, NERC has urged every PSE to register their resources prior to the implementation of  E-Tag 1.7. If you are a pure marketer, with no direct ability to schedule a generator or serve a load, then you are not required to register. However, if you own generation, if you have an obligation to serve, or if you have the direct ability to schedule a resource, then you must register that resource.
Entergy is encouraging our valued customers to register their sources and sinks. When registering your sources and sinks on the NERC website www.tsin.com, please follow the already existent Source/Sink naming convention. This will enable us, and our integrated systems to clearly recognize the desired transaction, and create no confusion when assessing the submitted tag. If you have any questions  please direct them to Alexander Mitreski at (870) 541 - 4535 or amitres@entergy.com. if you have already registered your Source/Sink within our Control Area, please disregard this friendly reminder.
