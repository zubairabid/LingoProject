Hola,

If all recipients would please be soooo kind as to respond back with a home
mailing address....except for suebob and jojo..got your's already.

Well, we I made it safely to UT.  We made the drive in about 2 days getting
to Provo the 2nd evening and Park City the following morning.  Now I am
reminded why they always say that it is much safer to fly than to drive
cross country.  The first day we NARROWLY avoided running out of gas in
NOWHERE texas...and I also got a speeding warning from a state trooper.  The
2nd day of driving across UT on a two-land highway from Moab to Provo was
harsh...it was snowing..i had a deathgrip on the steering wheel while
oncoming cars blinded me with their headlights and john slept.  Those are
just the bad parts but it was well worth the time hanging with John and
seeing the country.

I've met my 3 roomates, Jimmy, James & Thomas... and they seem normal and to
John's delight none of them will be gracing a "Gorgeous Hunks of Park City
Utah" calendar anytime soon.  It has been snowing almost non-stop since I've
been here...and it seems that everyone is off to ski or board here in town.
I'm trying my best to hold off until the end of the week when all of my
skiing and boarding activities will be free.  I am scheduled to start this
thurs at the bakery.  I'm considering picking up another part time job just
to keep things interesting, but I'm going to see how things go with a 40hr
schedule first.

I hope everyone is doing well.  I just wanted to say hello and most
importantly get everyones home address. So take care all and I'll be in
touch.
