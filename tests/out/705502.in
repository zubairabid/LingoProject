Sta.3, 4 and 5

As you may know, we are at the end of our grace period for not being required
to do monthly sampling for the public water systems at sta. 3,4 and 5.  Jeff
Lobstein has been requested to do the monthly drinking water sample
collections at  each of the three compressor station and has three months
completed.  This memo is a reminder that each location is again required to
send their drinking water analytical reports to the following agencies on a
monthly basis as the analytical results are received at each compressor
station.

Stations 3 and 4:   each months reports are to be sent to the following 2
agencies:

Navajo Nation EPA
P.O. Box 339
Window Rock, AZ 86515

Atten: Yolanda Barney   Program Manager


US EPA    Region IX
75 Hawthorne Street
San Francisco, CA 94105

Atten: Danny Collier (WTR-6)


Station 5:    your water sample reports are to be sent to the Navajo Nation
EPA in Window Rock, AZ, only.  In speaking with Charlie, he has indicated
that he will be handling  the reporting for Station 4 also.

I have contacted Nortest in Flagstaff (520) 774-2312, which is the lab
selected to do the testing to send station 3 reports to station 3 and station
4 and 5 reports to station 5.

The Navajo Nation has been given primacy and will be taking over the drinking
water program for the Navajo Nation in November of this year.  Expect some
changes in reporting.   Youmay want  to use MCS as a monthly reminder for the
submittal of the reports.  Questions, give me a call  505 625-8022..
