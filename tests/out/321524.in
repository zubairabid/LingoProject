I have since met with Ben on this agreement but wanted to let you see my
comments as you are incorporating Deerfield's changes.  I was in meetings all
day and just realized that I never sent this out.
Finance comments.  I have left a message with Rose asking what her comments
to you were so we could coordinate.  Since I haven't heard from her yet I
will provide these and follow-up if there are any others which need
mentioning after I speak with her.
1.  The Effective Date needs to change to "2001"
2.  In Section 2 Landscaping: To avoid any accounting issues raised by
Accounting, it would be very helpful and along the intent as you indicated to
Billy, if you would add at the beginning: "After commencement of construction
of the Facility but prior to the issuance of a CofO......."
3.  Section 4 needs to have a global search done to change all the "PBEC"s to
"DBEC"s.
4.  Section 6:  Is the Facility truly deemed a "Factory" for permitting fees
or are we changing the normal classification for a power plant in this
agreement?
5.  Section 7(b):  Will we be charging the City for the easement for their
cellular tower?  What is the consideration otherwise for doing so since we
are paying them all sorts of money for the other items for which we are using
the City?
Extra period at the end of this Section.
6.  In the Termination Section can we put in the language from Pompano Beach
which said that if the Agreement is terminated, all parties relieved of their
obligations and an instrument would be recorded with County (offset to
initial recordation of Agreement) indicating that Ag terminated and all
obligations of the parties have been released?
7.  Does the City need to obtain any approvals prior to execution or at any
other time to execute and have this be a valid agreement on their part?
8.  I noted that there is no Notices section nor Counterparts section.  Are
they truly not needed here?  Execution occurring in same place on same doc?
