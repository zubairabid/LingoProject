Just FYI.  I got a call from Liz Orr [Wildhorse] who said per her acctg group
we have been flowing around 2,700 mcf/d for October and November.   Per the
production spreadsheet from Jim/Dan, the production has been around 3,000
mcf/d +/- 50 mcf/d for both months.  This is the same as 3,200 mmbtu/d [Btu
factor is 1.06 to 1.07].  Our nom on Wildhorse has been 3200 mmbtu/d.

I just found out that our nom on Wildhorse s/b in mcfs, not in mmbtus.  So,
that will confuse matters.  Per Wildhorse we have an imbalance of 500 per day
[3,200 mcf/d nom vs actuals of 2,700 mcf/d] - 16,000 for Oct.  Thus, per
Wildhorse, we need to reduce the nom to around 2,200 mcf/d in order to come
back in line.   The concern with reducing the nom should not affect the VPP
volumes, but it will affect the excess volume [pricing] because for the month
of November, Paul Lucci has sold the 3,200 mmbtu/d as baseload.  Stacy Brewer
[ENA scheduler] will discuss with Paul.  Thus, if we reduce our nom, it will
affect his baseload market and he will have to go out and buy gas in order to
keep his market whole, and prices have gone up mid month.  [Mark Whitt - I
know this is mixing mcfs and mmbtus and in reality it's not as simply stated
as above].

In discussions with Jim, Dan Reineke [sp?] will get Wildhorse's actuals from
their acctg group, then he will reconcile his numbers with theirs, and come
up with the final actual numbers.  Apparently that will take him about a
day.  So, we need to wait til actuals get reconciled in order to figure out
what our imbalance is.  We do need to reduce our nom from 3,200 mcf/d to
3,000 mcf/d, but Liz said to hold off on that for now.

Per disc with Jim Osborne and Liz Orr, 11/15 pm.
