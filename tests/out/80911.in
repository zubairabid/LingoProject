Dutch - please double check the below information and comment on it.
According to Man, Man expected these positions to be xpitted per their conversations with Dutch and John on 10/31/2001.  They were not xpitted.  If these were supposed to be xpitted and we did not do it, please sign off on it so Jason and Errol can implement it early on Friday 11/2.
Please call me if there is any confusion so that we can put this issue to rest as early as possible.
