Mike Grigsby has been in contact with Inside FERC regarding posting an index
at the Cheyenne Hub in the future.  Based on their request, we are providing
our trade data for your review.

Attached, please find a spreadsheet containing all  Fixed Price Physical
Trades transacted by Enron during the April Bid-week for May Baseload Flow at
Cheyenne Hub points.  In addition to the trades listed, Enron provided
further liquidity at Cheyenne with 7 index related deals that have not been

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Thank you.
