Rod-

Nice to see your name - I haven't seen you in a while as I'm no longer attending Causey's meetings since I'm in RAC.

It's fine for Enron subsidiaries to have their own risk management policies that fit within Enron's risk management policy, and because we do want them to meet Enron's requirements, I'm glad you're working with Frank so we can help you work through it.  In addition, I'm in the process of re-writing Enron's risk management policy, and if there are certain transportation and distribution risk management issues that we should be addressing, I'd like to discuss those with you so we can incorporate those into this version of Enron's policy.

Our current version of the Enron policy that was approved in this month's BOD meeting is attached FYI.



Thanks,

Cassandra.
