Shelley, I compiled the attached spreasheet as per my conversation with Sheila.  It contains the list of firm contracts for ENA and their associated capacity release volumes as well as designee information.  The first tab has the contract information and the second tab has the designee information.  Please review and let me know if you need further information.  nb
