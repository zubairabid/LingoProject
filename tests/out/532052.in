PG&E hasfiled the attached, &Motion to Establish Final Market
Valuation of Non-Nuclear Generating Assets Pursuant to Public Utilities Code
Section 367.8 The motion requests  that the Commission consolidate in the
docket used for the recent rate  stabilization decision the existing record
of PG&E,s remaining major  non-nuclear generating asset market valuation
proceedings and immediately adopt  a final market valuation for all of PG&E,s
remaining non-nuclear generating  assets. The market valuation dockets that
would be consolidated in this  proceeding include A.99-09-053 (hydroelectric
assets); A.00-05-031 (Kern); and  A.00-05-034 (Humboldt Bay).

The utility requests that this be doneprior to  establishing
the revenue requirements and rates for PG&E,s retained  generating assets
pursuant to the June 15 Chief ALJ,s Ruling. That ruling set a hearing
schedule for  determining the revenue requirements of the three utilities
related to retained  generation,QFs, bilateral contracts, and ancillary
services.  PG&E asks that theCommission rule on its Motion as soon as
possible  and no later than July 19, so that PG&E and interested parties have
the  benefit of the ruling prior to the beginning of hearings on July 23,
2001.

PG&E argues that since the Commission has  not completed market valuations
for PG&E,s generating assets,it  therefore may not legally determine the
value of those assets for ratemaking  purposes until such time as those
market valuations are complete. In fact, there has been no action
whatsoever inPG&E,s hydroelectric market valuation proceeding since  January
22,when the Chief ALJ issued a ruling canceling a prehearing  conference and
public participation hearings, and extending the comment period  on the draft
environmental impact report.

The utility stresses that Section 367(b) of  the PU Coderequires the
Commission to market value the utilities,  generation assets &not later than
December 31, 2001,8 and that it has to be,  &based on appraisal, sale or
other divestiture.8 They also note that AB 6 from the  Legislature,s First
Extraordinary Session modified Section 377 toprohibit  PG&E from selling any
of its existing generating assets until at least  January 1, 2006, and
requires that those assets be dedicated for the benefit of  California
ratepayers. Since AB 6X  precludes the Commission from valuing PG&E,s
generating assets by sale or  divestiture, appraisal is the only lawful
method.

PG&E concludes that effective January 1,  2002, its non-nuclear retained
generation must be reflected in utility rates on  the same basis as the
market value determined for purposes of AB 1890 stranded  cost computations.
Therefore,  themarket valuations adopted by the Commission will have to be
included in  the consideration of URG ratemaking in this proceeding. The
motion says that thevaluations  are also essential prerequisites to the
determination of any amounts that might  be made available under the current
rate structure for payment to the DWR as  provided for in AB1X. PG&E
concludes that market valuation of its retained generating assets is an
essential prerequisite to establishing their revenue requirement, which is
hardly illogical.
