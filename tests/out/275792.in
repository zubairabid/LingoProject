We had a conference call this afternoon to discuss the next steps
(Participants:  Beth, Shona, David Port, Jeff Sommers, John Bergren(EAS),  Heidi Mason (person who did Seoul Doorstep from Australia), Darrell Kinder (in charge of the Enron Seoul office and the SK relationship))
The net result of our discussion was that Heidi will be making another trip to Seoul (in 2 weeks) to scope out the deals since the inception of the JV (Jan 99) and to validate that the assumptions that she made in her analysis are correct.  One of Jeff Sommers' people from Houston will accompany her in order to meet some of the people there and take a hand off from Heidi(since she has a day job in Australia)in terms of following up to see that these issues are resolved.
Major Issues to be looked at on round 2:   -- see further detail from Heidi below
1.  Figure out if SK Gas really is intentionally running unprofitable transactions thru the JV with their 100% owned entity SK Global  and quantify(note the $.5mm below is on 		an accrual basis not MTM)
2. Emphasize the need to both the JV and to Enron SK that they need to formalize a trading policy(brought up by AA in the doorstep they did a year ago)
3.  Take a deeper look at their International sales(outside of Seoul) as there are much fewer controls in place; credit issues could be a problem
4.   Propose some regular reporting that should go to the Enron JV people to monitor transations and improve communication
I know Heidi is not thrilled about going back(she had to eat meals with locals who were eating eye balls!)and she is very busy running the Australian operations and back office, but knows that this is an important issue.  Darrell Kinder feels like she will get the best results.    Fernley, just an FYI to you, so that you know she will be heading back there for a few days.
Jeff and I will schedule a seperate download session with the 3 of you for the SK Gas JV once the next trip is complete.
