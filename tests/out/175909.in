We just received a letter from the PX asking us to enter into an indemnity
agreement with them or requiring us to post collateral for the full amount of
the unsecured credit exposure.  We are researching this issue from the EES
side.  Wanda and Don, we are sending this letter to you.  Can you determine
what amounts we are talking about for EES?   This letter has also been sent
to EPMI and Portland General and I assume will be reviewed by their legal
team.  Bill Bradford, have you sent this on to Portland General.?
If I have missed someone that this memo should have been forwarded to, please
forward it on.
Jeff Dasovich, can you forward to Mike Day?
