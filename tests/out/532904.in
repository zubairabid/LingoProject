Here is the latest......
Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker last night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison bailout plan tomorrow.
Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses. Since it is not expected to be any hearing on any bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August 20th - we look  for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 15th deadline.
