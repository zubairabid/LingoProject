FYI below from Webb on the project with Webb and Vince Kaminski (EOL trade data).

Also, on 2002 budget, we agreed with EA OTC (Louise) yesterday on their total ENW budget for 2002 broken out into EnronOnline, Operations, Systems Development and IT Infrastructure for both expense and capital with Systems Development broken in to two portions, one supported by operations and one supported by gas and power commercial.  We will work with EA, EGM, EIM, and EEL next week to see if we can get them to accept a pricing structure for EOL that is more service and transaction based.  Brad is working with Louise, Sheriff and Shankman on this and our goal is to get something structured in this manner.

We also plan to get the EIM and EGM OTCs to agree to their complete budgets early next week.  ENW also has a meeting with the EES OTC on their ENW budget next week.

Due to all these numbers moving around so much (mostly down) and in an effort to keep Kerry Roper, Sally Beck and Pickering  focused on making progress with the business units, I am going to wait until next Tuesday or Wednesday to have a new ENW 2002 packet sent to you if that is OK.  Since we met with you on the total ENW budget on October 15th, EA alone went down $6 million in expense and $31 million in capital. We are making good progress down on EIM and EGM as well.  EES might be a different story.

When you get that packet, you will see 2001 forecast vs. 2002 plan on the date we met you (October 15th) vs. where we are on October 22nd for 2002 Plan.  You will also have the total IT depreciation across EA, EGM, EIM, EES, EEL, ENW, EBS.  This is slowly trickling in but we feel good that we can get it right.

Please e-mail me back if you need anything sooner or if you have any questions or comments.

Thanks.
