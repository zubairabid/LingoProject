Rick --

Some thoughts and actions from Govt Affairs.

1. On pg 2 of the Presentation, you state an equation:

Commodity Transactions + Bundled Transactions + Upsell = Total Savings.

Isn't it better to define the result as "Total Value Created" rather than
Total Savings.  Then you can split the value between "EES Profit" and
"Customer Savings"?

EES is creating value by (a) commodity management and (b) DSM.  They are then
responsible for finding the balance in negotiations with the customer between
themselves (profit) and the customer (savings).  This definition more closely
works with the numerical findings on page 9.

The discussion on page 11 is also confusing.   What are "EES Projected
Savings"?  Don't you mean EES Projected Earnings?

Just a thought.  Not critical to my section.

2. Page 8 identifies $14.7 MM as the "Worst Case Stress Test" for the 39.6
Twh of Regulated Commodity.  Govt Affairs is doing an analysis on this to
make sure that we are comfortable with the results.  There are two problems:
(1) a 5% parallel shift in Regulated Commodity curves is probably not the
"Worst Case" and (2) the data from EES is difficult to obtain.

We think that a better measure would be to find the potential loss if
regulated rates continue to grow at their historic growth factor = 1985 -
1995 was .7% a year.   The problem is that it is difficult to compute because
the EES systems don't give us a nice and easy structure to evaluate.  John
Nesalge is working on this number.

3. Page 9 identifies the Regulatory Risk Capital as $9.5MM for the Top 5
Commodity deals.  We are checking on this.  It has been hard to compute.
Same problems as #2.   I would say that $9.5MM is at least the overall
Regulatory Risk Capital.  John Neslage is working on this number.

4. Page 8 uses the terms "Wholesale" and "Regulated".  Page 4 uses the terms
"Wholesale" and "Retail".  I assume that you are thinking about the same set
of costs / services?  If I am correct, I would change the term on page 4 to
"Regulated Price Reduction" or otherwise explain the difference / similarity.

5. We are working on identifying the value at risk for the PG&E position
(California CTC roll-off).  There is also a growing Regulatory Risk on
Illinois CTC roll-off = EES is assuming that the CTC ends in Illinois one
year earlier than the current law allows.  We may also try to calculate this
figure.  My understanding is that these numbers will not be incorporated into
the presentation but will be provided to Rick Buy as FYI.  Is that correct?
John Neslage is working on these numbers.

6. Conclusion page 13.

Point #4 dealing with Regulatory Risk.

Can we change the presentation to state the following:

FINDINGS

EES' Regulated Rate forecasts do not document legal, political, and
regulatory assumptions.  Enron Government Affairs has not uniformly validated
key Regulated Rate forecast assumptions.  Very limited ability to hedge
Regulated Rate risk.

EXPOSURE

We are working on trying to quantify.  Should say "Rate Growth at Historic
85-95 Levels = $XX MM".

RECOMMENDATIONS

EES should document all legal, political, and regulatory assumptions embedded
within Regulated Rate forecasts.  Enron Government Affairs should provide
regular input into forecasting process to ensure Regulated Rate forecasts
incorporate all relevant information.  Enron Government Affairs should
perform monthly curve review process on critical rate forecasts.


Finally, I hope that John Neslage will have these figures by end of business
Tuesday.  Does this work?  Please call either John or Harry to coordinate.  I
am leaving for South America today.
