Jim,

I spoke to Bob Lewis (someone I used to work with at APX) Bob has extensive
BPA experience.

Bob told me that BPA has about 8000Mws of generation and 11000MWs of load for
this year.  As he understands, BPA should be covered for 2001, they have
essentially paid most of the DSI's (Aluminum Plants, not to run.  BPA has
also negotiated a deal with some Irrigation districts, totalling about 600
MWs and worked with some others to buy down their load).  BPA had a excess of
one(1) $ Billon in the bank which is essentially used up now.  The only way
they can replenish this fund is to raise rates under the CRAC, Cost Revenue
Adjustment Clause.  Depending upon the water year for 2002 the rates will
more than likely go back down in 6-12 months.  As I undrstood, BPA should
have all their load covered, eith by their own generation, load buy-downs or
short-term (spot) contracts.  The only DSI (Aluminum Plant) that I have heard
is not participating in the BPA Buy-Back is Kaiser and they are taking their
$20 power and reselling it on the spot at $200!

As I'm sure you know, BPA was formed to sell preference power from federal
projects, unitl 1980 they matched their output to the load.  In 1980 there
was an ACT passed which BPA was given the authority to acquire power to meet
new demand.  Until this past year and the shortages in California, BPA could
meet their increased demand on the spot markets, but with prices contorted
because of CA, acquiring power on the spot has been prohibitive, so we have
everyone becoming attentive to the problems in the west.

Kind Regards,

Dave
