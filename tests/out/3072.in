This year we are sending out a Burning Issues form (Burning Issues102301.doc) for you to fill out and email to myself or drop in the box at the handouts table on the first meeting day.  We are hoping this will give everyone a chance to get their issues out on the table for discussion.
We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
