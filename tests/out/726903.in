Whether you're investing for your kids' education or your retirement, the
new federal tax law may make your goals easier to reach. The $1.35-trillion
tax relief package could affect your finances in many areas, from investing
for college and retirement to managing income and estate taxes.

Many of the tax cuts will phase in gradually over the next several years.
But to help you take advantage of all possible provisions, we should start
planning soon. Some of the ways you may benefit include:

Lower income tax rates. The gradual reduction of tax rates has already
begun. In fact, the new withholding schedule went into effect on July 1.
And, you should receive a tax rebate check soon due to the creation of a new
10% bottom rate retroactive to January 1, 2001. As tax rates fall over the
next few years, your disposable income will likely rise - offering an
opportunity to invest more toward your various goals.

Education-funding incentives. Parents who want to help their children attend
college may now find their financial task easier. The tax relief act will
improve education savings tools such as:

Education IRAs - The accounts' contribution limit will rise from $500 to
$2,000 in 2002. What's more, money in these accounts can now be used for
elementary and secondary school costs in addition to higher education
expenses.

State sponsored 529 college savings plans - Also beginning in 2002,
distributions from these plans for qualified education expenses will be tax
free. Currently earnings in the accounts are deferred and taxed at the
beneficiary's rate upon withdrawal. 529s are particularly attractive due to
their generous contribution limits.

Deductions for education expenses - The act increases eligibility for
student loan interest deductions and it creates a new deduction for higher
education expenses.

The Child Tax Credit - Though not tied specifically to education expenses,
this credit will provide increasing help to parents investing for college.
Previously $500 per qualifying child under 17, the credit increases to $600
in 2001-2004, $700 in 2005-2008, $800 in 2009 and $1,000 in 2010 and
thereafter.

Higher retirement plan contribution limits. The tax act will allow people
with earned income to invest more in retirement plans and IRAs - possibly
helping them retire sooner and more comfortably. Your options may include:

Traditional and Roth IRAs - Annual contribution limits for both of these
types of IRAs will gradually rise from $2,000 this year to $5,000 in 2008.
After that, the limits will be indexed to inflation in $500 increments.

401(k)s and 403(b)s - Working individuals also may be able to invest more
in their employer retirement plan. The limit on elective deferrals will
gradually rise from $10,500 this year to $15,000 in 2006, and this doesn't
include the catch-up contribution provision for people 50 years and older.

And much more. There are other provisions in the new tax law that may
benefit you and your family. When we meet, we'll identify the ones that
apply to you and help you make the most of them.

As you can see, the new tax law provides meaningful tax savings in a number
of areas. But because the changes will be phased in gradually - and some are
set to expire after 2010 without reauthorization - your planning must be
flexible enough to react to year-by-year changes.

Such planning is where American Express Financial Advisors excels. I'm
