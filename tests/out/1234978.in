Privileged and confidential
Dear John:
Thank you for your prompt response regarding the matter.
I have received you mail asking me to call you and I have reached Mr. Randy
Pais.
According to the discussed with him, please be informed that Mr. Arap
Sobrinho  as delegate manager in EPCB articles of association is able to sign
both the company representative letter, as well as the power of attorney to
Tozzini Freire.
It is important to clarify that Ms. Cunha shall be representing EPCB in
court, since the labor action has been filed against both EPCB and EPE and
not SCC.
Unfortunately, these documents have to be filed before court in their
originals. Mr. Pais has requested me to fax me a copy of the signed power of
attorney as soon as I have it.
As regards the correspondence regarding this matter, I am already copying all
of the people mentioned by you.
Should you need any further assistance in connection with the matter, please
advise.
Best regards,
Ana Paula Gonalves
