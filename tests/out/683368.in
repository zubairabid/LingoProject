The attached indicates that UC/CSU are still not fully back to DA.  Does it
make sense to try and get their help in making sure that the legislation does
not limit their return to DA?  What is our current relationship with that
customer?
Also, does anyone have any problems with Govt Affairs using this information
when we are asking for "clarification" on the July 12 date?  It may be
helpful to highlight for the key legislative members exactly who they are
hurting with their decisions.
Thanks,
Jim
