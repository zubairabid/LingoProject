Thanks, Dan.  I'm having a very difficult time seeing how Enron will have any choice other than to vigorously (and respectfully) 1) decline to offer up any contracts and 2) assert our view that Karl Wood it is unfair to attempt to impose any quid pro quo, i.e., forcing folks to waive their due process rights by declining to hand contracts over to Karl.
