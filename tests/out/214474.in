Here's my list:
UK Power.  Address flaws in NETA through inter alia modifications to the
Balancing and Settlement Code.  Value difficult to quantify, but very large
given direct costs of high imbalance charges and resultant increase in the UK
power curve.
UK Power.  Frustrate Ofgem's proposals for locational transmission charging
which could cost Teesside Power up to o10m p.a. (from memory).
UK Rail.  Continue to prosecute the Competition Act complaint against EWS
Railways.  This could reduce our rail charges by up to 25% and could create
opportunities to grow the coal business in the UK further (eg, by unwinding
existing long-term contracts)
UK Gas. Ofgem plan to move to hourly gas balancing which would represent a
major risk/cost given our existing flexibility positions.  Objective is to
shape these proposals to minimise this risk and delay/frustrate their
introduction.
Spanish Gas/Power (Alfredo Huertas) - gas third party access for the Arcos
project (don't know exact value, but John Sherriff has described this as his
No. 1 priority at the moment)
Spanish Gas/Power (Alferdo Huertas) - removal of restrictions on financing
structures on the Arcos project
I suggest the four of us work on a consolidated list when we have the
individual lists.
