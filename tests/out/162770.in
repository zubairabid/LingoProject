Chicago Residents, Natural Gas Bills Could Rise 50 Percent

Oct. 3--Chicago residents are likely to see their
natural gas heating bills jump as much as 50
percent this season, officials with Peoples
Energy Corp. said Monday.

Prices for natural gas are almost double what they
were a year ago, pushed upward as the nation's
booming economy makes demands on a tight
supply. And many electric utilities are switching
from coal-fired generation plants to natural gas
generation plants, adding to pressure on the supply.

Natural gas prices were about $1.85 per metric
thousand cubic feet at the source last year. But
through July of this year, the price was $3.49 per
mcf--an 89 percent increase.

Those prices may translate to sticker shock when
Chicago-area consumers open their bills this winter.

For October 1999 through March 2000, the average
Peoples Energy residential customer who uses
natural gas for home heating and cooking paid
$735. This season, Peoples Energy is projecting
that same customer will pay $1,083, said Luis
Diaz-Perez, a Peoples spokesman.

"We are going to continue to communicate with our
customers on ways to manage this winter's bill,
whether that be through tips on economizing at
home or information about payment plans and
financial assistance programs," Diaz-Perez said.

In July, Nicor Inc. predicted that its customers,
located primarily in the Chicago suburbs, could see
their bill rise by as much as $200 over last year for
the same six-month period. But Nicor expects to
revise that prediction upward this week, said Lee
Haines, a spokesman for Nicor.

Haines noted that the October gas cost for Nicor
customers is 63 cents per therm, up from 51.5
cents per therm for September. And the October
cost per therm is 70 percent higher than last year's
cost of 37 cents per therm, Haines said.

Said Marty Cohen, executive vice president of the
Citizens Utility Board in Chicago: "Most
consumers are unaware of what they are in for this
winter. They haven't taken note that gas prices are
dramatically higher than they were a year ago."

Cohen suggested that consumers study the gas
companies' varied payment options to determine
whether spreading payments out evenly over the
year would make economic sense for their families.

As expensive as it's likely to be to heat a
Chicago-area home this winter, prices are higher in
other areas, says Donato Eassey, first vice
president for natural gas research at Merrill Lynch in
Houston. Nationally, Eassey said, residential prices
for natural gas have escalated 88 percent over last
year.

"If they are only increasing 48 percent in the
Chicago area, they've done a good job of keeping
costs down," Eassey said.

Eassey also said that even if the predicted price
increases occur, the cost of natural gas is still
much lower than it has been in the past.

Consumers enjoyed a significant decrease in gas
prices between mid-1984 and 1999, with prices on
average down 2 percent or 3 percent, though the
consumer price index stayed steady, Eassey
noted.

"We've been spoiled by cheap energy," Eassey
said. "It's still the best bargain in town."

But Eassey noted that rising prices appear to be
encouraging gas companies to push for exploration,
which in the long run could increase supply and
keep the lid on prices.

When prices were low, Eassey said, "we just didn't
have the drill bit turning to the right often enough.
There was not enough incentive to invest in new
prospects."

Last year, the number of rigs drilling for natural gas
was 597; now the number is up to 806, a 35 percent
increase, he said.

Severin Borenstein, the director of the University
of California at Berkeley's Energy Institute, agreed
that high energy prices are likely to encourage
energy companies to look for new sources of
supply.

"The politics are such that the higher prices are
going to add fuel to the debate over drilling for fossil
fuels in North America," especially in normally
sacrosanct areas such as Alaska, Borenstein said.
