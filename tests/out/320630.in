Mathew,
Per our conversation yesterday, I would reiterate the importance of a team
meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be
a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to
all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating.
As a general rule, you should know that under federal law, Indian tribes are
legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation
by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction
unless they consent to it.  They are entitled to establish their own
governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law
requirements.  To illustrate, with respect to our potential project with them
it means we will need to address such issues as: (1) getting BIA approval for
our site acquisition on Indian land, non-Indians can only lease tribal land
and for our type of transaction, our lease will require approval from the
BIA; (2) tribal taxes may impact the facility; (3) tribal permits, licenses
etc will apply, including tribal environmental laws -- the tribe may have its
own tribal EPA for instance; (4) preserving the right to challenge any tribal
taxes or regulations in courts, other than the tribal courts; (5)
specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we
can subject them to federal court jurisdiction; (6) specifically ensuring
that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in
executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable; and (7)
specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that
Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts.  Evaluating
all of the above as well as the numerous other issues that will likely arise
will require consultation with and the cooperation of the Tribe.
As you know, I am still in the process of identifying outside counsel who is
an expert in Indian law matters.  As an update on that, our other Florida law
firm currently represents the Seminoles on other matters so they are
conflicted out of representing us.  Presently, I am waiting to hear back from
an Indian lawyer who was involved in the recent hotel/gaming development
transaction between the Seminoles and the Hard Rock Cafe group.  Although he
is based in Wisconsin, he is with a very large firm which has offices in
Florida and Washington, DC, and which currently represents Enron on other
matters.  After speaking with him, I will further debrief you and if we elect
to engage him, I will then seek my internal approvals for doing so.
In the interim, I have been receiving advice from a retired Vinson & Elkins
lawyer who has worked with Enron on its other dealings when Indian tribes
were involved (ie, right of way agreements involving our pipeline
companies).  He has prepared a brief memo on his views on our letter of
intent and general issues that arise when dealing with tribes.  I would be
happy to share that document with you (note that I have tried to summarize
most of it above.)  As a result of that memo, I do have some changes to
incorporate into our letter of intent and I am still waiting to hear from you
on how to modify the letter of intent based on your prior email.  (I also
have a more comprehensive legal paper entitled "Energy Business in Indian
Country: Opportunities and Obstacles" if you are having trouble sleeping at
night.)
Lastly, as for Bill Bryant's current activity below, based on what you've
told me and the email traffic, he seems as if he is looking at the right
regulatory issues, but with an area of law as so complex as this is, I would
caution that you and Marchris should narrowly define and monitor his
activities as it could otherwise quickly result in a very expensive research
project.
Thanks and please let me know when we discuss this project further.  At a
minimum, I would suggest that we try to focus on finalizing the letter of
intent with the Seminoles so that we can begin the process of exchanging
confidential information and entering into more substantive discussions with
them.
