Marcus,
New Power wants to close out their gas hedge positions.  Under which Enron entity were these financial deals confirmed.  It probably makes sense to have them execute the opposite trades within the same legal entity to improve netting rights and cap exposure by entity.
Please advise so I can inform the EES trading desk and ENA trading desk of how to proceed.
Bill
