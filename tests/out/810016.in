Jeff (CES) and I just had a nice chat about the Choice program. Jeff
mentioned the "famous contracts" that should be used for Choice Peaking
outside the SST. I double checked with Joann and these contracts are being
used for CES Endusers (C&I customers) as follows:

37956 600 CES EU
61822 4000 CES EU
61825 8000 CES EU
61838 1000 CES EU
61990 2000 CES EU
65402 13400 CES EU (contract total is 20,000)
65418 500 CES STOI
66931 4000 Jeff this is Enron's transport. The Paulding contract went away
effective 4/1/2000.
67693 1200 CES EU
Rest  CHOICE
38021 19041 CES EU (note... we are using Dayton, because not enough capacity
for CES EU)
38021 27,000 STOI


If you want us to use these contracts for Choice, we would have to cut the
CES EU volumes to 0. This would impact about 40 nominations on TCO side. You
would have to ask Kara/Heidi/Kim/Donna... how many nom's on their side.
Because of the labor involved and the general consensus not to cut CES EU
markets, we have always left these nom's alone. We have found other capacity
for Choice gas above the SST capacity (54,000 now and 134,000 in the winter).
There are many different options... and we can discuss them over a conference
call.

The other item to consider, the Choice program requires us to have some STOW
to use to balance Choice burns. Currently, I have been doing 50/50 to 60/40
split (pool/stow). The baseload target is 20,000. Actual STOW for April has
been 2400 to 42,000 depending on mother nature. This is up for discussion...
I used to discuss this with Paul and Noel on daily basis. Now, I'm just doing
it on my own.

Lastly, our target for net STOI is 36,000 a day. We have been calling for
overinjections, caused by mother nature and choice actuals. My understanding
is that CES had a different goal for net STOI... we just need this clarified
and can move forward for the rest of the month. We have typically tried to
meet the EOM goal, not necessarily a daily goal because of choice actuals
cause havoc. Therefore, we can get the net STOI back in line... with the
remainding days.

Hope this covers it.
