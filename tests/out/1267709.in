Hello.  This notice is being sent to all trained fire wardens I have listed at Enron Center North.  As you may know, each year the Houston Fire Department reviews every high rise building to make sure they are in compliance with the Houston city fire code.  As part of that process, it is required by law that Enron maintain accurate records of all trained fire wardens as well as keep an ongoing list of any persons with a mobility impairment who may require special assistance during a fire drill or evacuation.  A fire drill will occur at Enron on or before December 1st.  Therefore, as trained fire wardens on your respective floors, if you know of anyone who may require special assistance during an actual fire drill or building evacuation, please forward there names to me so that I may obtain their contact information to maintain on file.  The Houston Fire Department is subject to fine Enron between $250 and $2000 for every daily violation that occurs if these records are not kept up to date.  Note, this information is strictly for use to have on file for the Houston Fire Department.  It will be kept confidential.  Thank you in advance for your assistance.
