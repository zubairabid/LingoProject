Updates for Today's NetCo regression test at 1:00pm:

NT User Id's
For testing, if you are NT user id that participated in the 'PILOT' group, please use your PILOT id.
Otherwise, use the nc_t_xxxx accounts as previous testing.  The NT conversion for all remaining NetCo is expected to take place tonight 02/04.

Global Data
Below is my current understanding of the counterparties used for testing.  Contract setup is near complete and we will have the updates when deal entry starts.

1305 UBS Warburg Energy LLC acting as agent for UBS AG, London Branch
11266 UBS Canada Branch (name TBD)

54979 Duke Energy Trading and Marketing, L.L.C.
64245 Williams Energy Marketing & Trading Company
65268 Reliant Energy Services, Inc.
3015 Tennessee Gas Pipeline Co.
Storage Service Contract 20000059  (Agency Contract 20000062)
Transportation Contract 20000057


The goals of the test are:
1) regression test a subset of scenarios (ie Physical Gas Sale, Physical Power Supply, Financial Swap, Intercomapny) now that the Global Data is more stable (UBS internal counterparties, profit centers, desks/ books)
2) Identify any reference to internal/ external screens that still have 'ENRON' reference, or 'EOL' reference
3) Ensure we have the latest price curve data from updates (ie TAGG/ERMS)
4) process new EOL data created for Monday.  To verify mid/ back office, including SAP processing.   EOL will also push data from a mock trading session for on 2/7 (see below)
5) provide the test data scenarios for SAP testing (scheduled Tuesday 1pm).  SAP is completing their setup with the new controlling area for NetCo.
6) Continue with NT Logins involved with PILOT untill remaining are ported.
