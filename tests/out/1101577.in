I am forwarding a file containing the most current projections we have for California volumes during August, 2001.  The summary sheet contains averages for selected hours and the typical monthly averages we usually supply you in three views: the month as a whole, beginning of the month, and end of the month.  It is presented this way to highlight the anticipated growth in load over the course of August by 200-300 MW per hour as more and more customers are returned to service on their respective bill cycles.

The load projections shown are totals including IBM in the North and SDG&E customers in the South.  The incremental loads of returned SCE and PG&E customers plus new load in SDGE is shown in the following table:



As we get newer and better data, we will keep you informed of changes in August projections.  I've taken the liberty of copying Jeff and Chris on this; please forward to whoever else needs it.  Thanks.  Call me or Michael Spruiell with questions.
