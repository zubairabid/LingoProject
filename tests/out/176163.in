Bush Expected To Act Soon To Fill FCC Chair; Transition Team Discusses Agency
Changes

With most of his decisions regarding top cabinet-level positions out of the
way, President Bush is expected to begin shifting his attention to selecting
lower-level political appointees, including the FCC chairman and the
administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA).

Late last week speculation was rife that a decision on the FCC top spot was
imminent, with a handful of insiders even predicting that a new chairman
could be appointed over the inaugural weekend or at the beginning of this
week.

One factor that several GOP insiders say could spur quick action from the
White House is the prospect of having Democratic Commissioner Susan Ness
assume the chairman's duties.  As the most senior Commissioner at the FCC,
Ms. Ness would slide into that role absent an interim appointment by the
president, notes one longtime FCC observer.  "And that just doesn't sit too
well with a Republican administration," the source said.

Most Washington insiders expect Commissioner Michael K. Powell to be named
interim chairman, as no Senate confirmation is needed for a sitting
Commissioner to assume that post.  "Mr. Powell is viewed by many as someone
who can get the FCC up and running without a learning curve," an industry
source told TR.

But the question of who gets the permanent FCC job has been the topic du jour
for most telecom industry watchers.  Sources say Texas Public Utility
Commission Chairman Patrick H. Wood III has been positioning himself for that
role, but Mr. Powell also is considered a front-runner for the position if he
wants it.

Under one scenario floated by a GOP insider, President Bush would name Mr.
Powell interim chairman and then, later on, nominate Mr. Wood as permanent
chairman and a new Democrat to replace Ms. Ness.  Ms. Ness' term expired in
June 1999; she currently is serving under a recess appointment that
then-President Clinton made late last month (TR, Dec. 25, 2000).  She may
continue in her position until a replacement is nominated by President Bush
and confirmed by the Senate, or until the end of the current congressional
session.

L. Ari Fleischer, a Bush transition team spokesman who was slated to become
White House spokesman after the inauguration, gave few clues during a Jan. 19
press briefing about where the incoming administration stood on naming new
agency heads.  Asked by TR whether a timetable had been developed for
appointing a new FCC chairman, Mr. Fleischer replied,  "That will happen in
due order as those announcements are ready."

A spokesman at the Commerce Department's NTIA said former Administrator
Gregory L. Rohde hadn't made any decisions about his future plans.  As a
political appointee under former President Clinton, Mr. Rohde stepped down
from his post last Friday.

"The wireless community wanted him to stay on at NTIA to help oversee the `
3G' [third generation] initiative, but so far there's been no indication"
that President Bush plans to renominate Mr. Rohde to be NTIA administrator,
the NTIA spokesman told TR.

Mentioned as possible candidates to succeed Mr. Rohde at NTIA are Earl
Comstock, a partner at the Washington law firm of Sher & Blackwell and a
former aide to Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska); James Derderian, former House
Commerce Committee staff director and a member of the NTIA transition team;
and Kevin Martin, who oversaw communications policy issues for the Bush
transition team.

FCC Transition Team Gathers

A Jan. 17 meeting of the Bush administration's FCC transition team may have
failed to produce a name and a timetable for replacing Mr. Kennard.  But
numerous industry participants described the meeting as a productive first
step in smoothing out some of the rough edges at the FCC-particularly the
pace at which the Commission makes decisions and its role in reviewing
mergers.

Participating in the Jan. 17 meeting, sources say, were nearly all of the FCC
"transition advisory team" members (TR, Jan. 15) and officials from the Bush
administration's "in-house" transition team:  Mr. Martin; former Rep. Bill
Paxon (R., N.Y.), who is chairman of the transition advisory committee; and
Rebecca Armendariz, project director-FCC transition team.

Speaking briefly with TR last week, Ms. Armendariz described the meeting as "
good" and "productive" and said it was the "first and last" time that the FCC
advisory team would meet with Bush transition officials.  Ms. Armendariz also
reported that the FCC advisory team had grown to a total of about 42 members,
which is "six to eight" more than was posted on the Bush-Cheney transition
Web site (http://www.bushcheneytransition.com) as of Jan. 19.

An advisory team member who didn't want to be identified said the meeting
lasted about one and a half hours and mostly focused on changes in general
FCC procedures.  "There wasn't much time for a lengthy discussion on specific
points, and they didn't mention any names" of potential chairman nominees,
the source said.  "But there was a sense that things need to be speeded up at
the FCC, and [that] there ought to be less FCC involvement in the
merger-review context," the source reported.

Meanwhile, documents circulated among the FCC advisory team members show the
Bush transition team sought feedback from the advisers on the following six
subjects:  (1) the top five issues facing the FCC; (2) what rules and/or
policies are in most need of reform; (3) what management, administrative or
procedural issues need to be addressed; (4) what can be done to expedite the
FCC's decision-making process; (5) what significant challenges will the new
administration and FCC face with respect to Congress, public perceptions, or
the press; and (6) what organizational changes should be considered early in
the new administration.

Participants in last week's meeting were given a chance to go over papers
containing their FCC "wish lists," sources report, and the Bush transition
team "seemed to be interested and listening."  Still, one source described
the meeting as "light on substance" and doubted whether "anyone had even read
our paper yet."

Jay Kitchen, an FCC advisory team member and president and chief executive
officer of the Personal Communications Industry Association, told TR he was
encouraged that finding more spectrum for third-generation (3G) technology "
was near the top of everybody's list."

PCIA's paper to the Bush team stressed the need to "speed up the tower-siting
process" and ensure that wireless carriers "receive all the interconnection
rights they are due under" the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Mr. Kitchen
said.

Progress & Freedom Foundation fellow Randolph J. May, also a member of the
FCC advisory team, called the Jan. 17 meeting "productive" and said it gave
the Bush transition team a "good chance to offer their views on what they
thought were the most important and pressing" issues at the FCC.  "At the top
of my list," Mr. May told TR, "was changing the strategic focus of the FCC
toward becoming a market deregulator."

SBC Communications, Inc., recently submitted a paper to the Bush team
recommending, among other things, "closing the reciprocal compensation
loophole" and "ensuring that the marketplace regulates broadband Internet
service," an SBC spokesman told TR.

SBC also proposed eliminating the "duplicative review of mergers" that
carriers face at the FCC and Department of Justice.  But SBC didn't specify
which review should be phased out.  "That's the policy question that needs to
be answered by the new administration," he said.

Even telecom interests that weren't represented on the FCC transition
advisory team have forwarded their telecom agendas to the Bush
administration.

In a letter sent to President-elect Bush on Jan. 18, the National Telephone
Cooperative Association advised him to appoint FCC commissioners who "
understand rural America" and give "considerable thought to rural
representation" at NTIA.

The Association for Local Telecommunications Services has submitted a paper
calling the "the failure" of incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to
open their networks one of the "three greatest market failures that stymie
full, effective competition."

"According to the FCC, after almost five years, the ILECs have opened their
networks to competitors in only two states," ALTS wrote.  "As a result,
[competitive local exchange carriers] have great difficulty interconnecting
with the Bell company networks to provide advanced services."

The Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association has had "extensive
conversations" with the Bush team about spectrum management issues, wireless
location privacy principles, repealing the 3% federal excise tax on telephone
bills, and moving from intercarrier compensation for wireless calls to a "
bill-and-keep" regime, a CTIA spokesman told TR last week.

FCC Focuses on International Detariffing, Intercarrier Compensation in
Biennial Review

The FCC has asked its staff to prepare proposals to eliminate or streamline a
broad range of Commission rules, including those governing intercarrier
compensation for terminating telecom traffic, wireless licensing terms and
renewals, and international service tariffs for nondominant interexchange
carriers.

The FCC issued its directives in a report released Jan. 17 in Common Carrier
docket 00-175.  The biennial regulatory review provisions of the
Communications Act of 1934 require the agency in even-numbered years to
decide whether given rules remain in the public interest, the FCC said.

The FCC doesn't have to take final action repealing or modifying the rules in
the even-numbered years, it said.

The latest FCC directives reflect staff recommendations outlined in a revised
version of the September 2000 staff report on the biennial regulatory review
(TR, Sept. 25, 2000).  The FCC wants the Common Carrier Bureau to prepare
rulemaking notices on the following:

Identifying alternative approaches to inter-carrier compensation "that
are more consistent with the long-term development of competition";

Excluding rural telcos from the requirements that independent incumbent
local exchange carriers provide interexchange service through separate
subsidiaries;

Simplifying FCC review of the "average schedules" used in determining
certain telcos' costs and shares of the National Exchange Carrier
Association, Inc.'s revenue pools; and

Changing the schedule for NECA board elections to reduce the
administrative costs of the association, which was created by FCC directive
to maintain access charge tariffs for many local exchange carriers.

The International Bureau will prepare rulemaking notices to initiate the
following streamlining efforts:

Extending the detariffing regime adopted for domestic interexchange
services to the international services of nondominant interexchange carriers,
"including commercial mobile radio service providers and U.S. carriers
classified as dominant solely because of foreign affiliations";

Further streamlining the earth station and space station licensing
processes;

Requiring electronic filing of applications for earth station licenses, to
save processing time;

Expanding the availability of pro forma transfers of control and
assignments of international facilities authorizations under section 214 of
the Communications Act of 1934; and

Reducing the reporting burdens for international telecom carriers.

The FCC asked the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to prepare rulemaking
notices to pursue the following streamlining goals:

Considering whether to eliminate restrictions "on the aggregate amount of
broadband PCS (personal communications service), cellular, and specialized
mobile radio spectrum that an entity can hold in any market";

Extending license terms beyond 10 years and implementing automatic or
default renewal procedures to avoid late-filing problems;

Considering partially privatizing the site-by-site, frequency-by-frequency
licensing process for the private and common carrier microwave services;

Bringing the technical and operational rules-including radiated power
restrictions-for cellular service, PCS, and general wireless communications
service into conformity with each other;

Considering whether any of its part 22 (cellular) rules are obsolete as a
result of competitive or technological developments; and

Bringing its radio frequency emission regulations into compliance with the
International Telecommunication Union's radio regulations.

And the Commission asked its Office of Engineering and Technology to prepare
rulemaking notices to address the following issues:

Clarifying a variety of equipment authorization rules and eliminating
ambiguities in equipment test procedures, including authorization procedures
for transmitters that operate both in the U.S. and overseas; and

Reviewing the emission limits on devices that operate in spectrum above 2
gigahertz.

The FCC also agreed with a staff recommendation that when it evaluates new
rules, it should use criteria similar to that used in the biennial review to
evaluate existing rules.  It stopped short, however, of adopting any criteria
in binding rules or procedures.

The FCC rejected a proposal the U.S. Telecom Association had offered in
comments on the September staff report (TR, Oct. 16, 2000).  USTA had asked
the FCC to set a firm time limit for acting to eliminate rules identified as
unnecessary during biennial reviews.

Citing the need to make the best use of its limited resources and to retain
flexibility, the FCC directed all bureaus and offices "to prioritize
rulemaking proceedings stemming from this biennial review on the basis of
various public policy considerations and a comprehensive evaluation of
comments received" in response to the planned rulemaking notices.

Issuing a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said the
FCC shouldn't view the biennial reviews as "a burden to be endured or a hoop
through which we must dutifully jump every other year."  He added, "As the
Commission moves forward, it is my sincere hope that we will devote
full-time, year-round staff to this endeavor.

Furchtgott-Roth Says Departure Of Kennard Won't Bring Deadlock

Although the departure of FCC Chairman William E. Kennard leaves the agency
temporarily with four members-two Republicans and two Democrats-Commissioner
Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth doesn't expect the agency to be deadlocked.

"A lot is made about the political divisions" at the FCC, he said Jan. 18
during his monthly briefing with reporters.  "But I really don't see it at
all."

About 90% of the FCC's votes over the past three years have been unanimous,
Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said.  Only about 2% or 3% have been 3-2 votes, he
estimated.  So it's unlikely that many votes will be deadlocked with the two
Republicans-Mr. Furchtgott-Roth and Michael Powell-voting against Democratic
Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani, he said.

Mr. Furchtgott-Roth commended then-Chairman Kennard for not trying to push "
11th-hour" initiatives before leaving the agency.  "A lot of people were
worried that some things might be railroaded through," he said.  "Chairman
Kennard has been very principled about this, not trying to do a lot of
11th-hour rules."

Meanwhile, Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said, the FCC had made "significant progress"
in its second "biennial review" of its regulations.  The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 directs the FCC to review its regulations every two years and to
eliminate or revise any rules that are no longer necessary or in the public
interest.

Last week, the FCC issued a report on what rule changes it would propose as a
result of its second biennial review (see separate story).

The report represents a "substantial improvement over the really pathetic
effort that was done two years ago" when the agency conducted its first
biennial review (TR, Jan. 4, 1999), Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said.

Mr. Furchtgott-Roth also reiterated his complaints about the FCC's
coordination with other agencies in reviewing mergers and related license
transfers.  Regarding the proposed Deutsche Telekom AG-VoiceStream Wireless
Corp. merger, Mr. Furchtgott-Roth disagreed with the FCC's decision to put
its review on hold while the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation probe national security concerns (TR, Dec. 25,
2000).

He said it would be inappropriate for the FCC to impose conditions on the
merger that are requested by DoJ and FBI.  That, however, has been the FCC's
practice in past merger reviews, he said.

Time Warner Telecom, Inc., intends to raise as much as $700 million through
the sale of stock and debt securities to help pay for its acquisition of GST
Telecommunications, Inc.  Time Warner Telecom, of Littleton, Colo., revealed
its plan in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The funds
would be used to repay an unsecured bridge loan that was used to pay for GST,
Time Warner Telecom said.  Further details of the fundraising effort will be
disclosed in future filings, it said.  Time Warner Telecom recently completed
the $690 million acquisition of GST, a competitive local exchange carrier
that was in bankruptcy (TR, Sept. 18, 2000).

UWB Operations Feasible In 3-6 GHz Band, NTIA Says

Ultrawideband (UWB) devices likely can operate in spectrum between 3 and 6
gigahertz without harming incumbent users, including fixed satellite service
(FSS) operators, according to test results released last week by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration.  But NTIA said that steps
to mitigate interference probably would be necessary.

NTIA has been studying the interference potential of UWB devices since last
year as part of a rulemaking proceeding launched by the FCC to explore
allowing UWB devices to operate on an unlicensed basis under part 15 of its
rules (TR, Nov. 6, 2000).

Separate tests of UWB devices' effect on Global Positioning System (GPS)
receivers are expected to be released next month.  The test results released
last week involved only non-GPS operations.

Results Will Aid Decision Making

NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said at a Jan. 18 news conference that
the test results "will form the basis of negotiations between NTIA and the
FCC to develop a final rule that will permit the development and availability
of ultrawideband technologies."

UWB devices use precisely timed pulses of radio frequency (RF) energy spread
across a wide swath of spectrum at extremely low power.  Proponents of the
technology have hailed its potential in myriad applications, including law
enforcement, fire and rescue services, the military, medicine, education, and
home and office local area networks (TR, Sept 18, 2000).  They say it won't
interfere with existing systems.

But aviation groups, the GPS and satellite industries, and others have
expressed concern that the devices could interfere with existing systems.
They've asked the FCC to hold off approving their use until tests show they
won't cause such interference.

In its tests, NTIA assessed the interference potential of five UWB devices on
federal air-route surveillance radar, airport surveillance radar, and air
traffic control beacon systems.

Based on the results of those tests, NTIA engineers developed mathematical
models to analyze the impact of UWB devices on nine other systems, including
those operating between 3100 and 5650 megahertz, or 3.1 and 5.65 GHz.  The
tests indicated UWB devices could operate in that range, although limits
might need to be placed on power levels, distance, and pulse-repetition
frequency.  However, there's a question about whether UWB devices would have
a "big enough window" to operate if restrictions are imposed, Mr. Rohde said.

Among those operating in that spectrum are FSS users (3.7-4.2 GHz), microwave
landing services (5.03-5.091 GHz), and Doppler weather radar (5.6-5.65 GHz).
For FSS systems, "the worst-case situation" with regard to interference "
would occur for receivers located at ground level with a low antenna
elevation angle of 5 degrees,"  NTIA's report said.  There would be much less
interference potential for FSS systems on tops of buildings or with higher
elevation angles, it said.

"However, at this time uncertainty exists as to the effect of UWB signal duty
cycle on the performance of FSS earth stations which have digital signal
processing," the report said.  "This information would assist in establishing
the UWB signal peak power limit; NTIA study is continuing on this important
consideration."

Regarding microwave landing services, UWB operations at power limits
currently permitted for part 15 devices may exceed the receiver interference
protection standard.  More analysis of the effect on such systems is needed,
NTIA said.

Tests on systems operating between 900 and 1610 MHz and 1610-3100 MHz
suggested there could be significant interference problems with incumbent
systems, NTIA officials said at the news conference.

But NTIA's report indicated that UWB operations below 3.1 GHz were possible.
It said that while UWB operations in that spectrum "will be quite
challenging," mitigating factors "could relax restrictions" on UWB devices.

It also said that UWB emission levels would have to be significantly reduced
to guard against interference.  And it concluded that further studies are
needed to assess degradation of existing systems, as well as relative levels
of noise, interference, and "clutter signals."

Mr. Rohde said NTIA engineers used existing standards for determining the
potential interference of UWB devices.  "Obviously this is going to be an
area that'll be the subject of a lot of debate. . .as to what really is the
criteria that determines interference," he added.

Findings Draw Praise

NTIA's test results drew praise from the UWB industry.  Officials of Time
Domain Corp., a leading marketer of UWB technology, said they were still
reviewing NTIA's findings.  But they indicated they were happy the tests
showed the devices could share non-GPS spectrum.

"While we have questions regarding some of the conclusions made by NTIA, we
are pleased that the test results confirm that compatible operation of UWB
devices with government services is possible," said Jeffrey L. Ross, Time
Domain's vice president-corporate development and strategy.  "We have full
confidence that the FCC will impose appropriate regulations and power limits,
and look forward to the FCC's timely completion of its rulemaking," he added.

Last year, Time Domain questioned NTIA's testing methods, saying they must
reflect real-world conditions to be accurate (TR, Sept. 4, 2000).

Another developer of UWB devices, Fantasma Networks, Inc., also hailed the
test results.  "We are confident that our deployment of ultrawideband
[devices] does not pose a threat of harmful interference to public safety
agencies or to any other user of the radio spectrum," said Roberto Aiello,
Fantasma's chief technology officer.

Angelos Amends Lawsuit Against Wireless Industry

As expected, noted plaintiffs' attorney Peter G. Angelos has entered the
legal fray against the wireless industry over the safety of mobile phones.
Mr. Angelos has filed an amended lawsuit on behalf of a Maryland doctor who
claims that using a mobile phone caused his brain tumor (TR, Aug. 7 and Dec.
25, 2000).

The lawsuit, filed last week in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, seeks
$375 million in compensatory damages and $750 million in punitive damages.

The lawsuit says the industry failed to conduct adequate testing on the
health effects of mobile phones and warn consumers about known risks.  The
industry "manipulated the results of other testing, concealed evidence that
[mobile phone] radiation is harmful and suppressed scientific and medical
research," the lawsuit alleges.

According to the lawsuit, the medical and scientific communities have been
aware of the biological effects of radio frequency (RF) exposure since the
1920s.  The wireless industry was or should have been aware of evidence of
such health hazards, the lawsuit alleges.

Michael F. Altschul, vice president and general counsel of the Cellular
Telecommunications & Internet Association, which is named in the lawsuit,
said he hadn't seen the amended complaint.

"Regardless of who the lawyer is. . .the legal requirements remain the same,"
Mr. Altschul said.  The plaintiffs have to show a link between RF radiation
exposure and cancer, he said, and "that science just isn't there."  Spokesmen
for Motorola, Inc., and Verizon Communications, Inc., which also are named as
defendants, have made similar points.

Last week's amended lawsuit, Christopher J. Newman et al. v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al. (case no. CCB-00-2609) was filed after U.S. District Judge Catherine
C. Blake last month dismissed a number of the counts in the original filing
but gave the plaintiffs permission to amend their complaint.  The wireless
industry had succeeded in moving the case from Baltimore City Circuit Court
to federal court.

Mr. Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, has won major cases against the
asbestos industry and represented Maryland in litigation against the tobacco
industry.  John A. Pica, a lawyer in Mr. Angelos' Baltimore firm, has been
quoted saying Mr. Angelos plans to file 10 lawsuits this year against the
wireless industry.  Messrs. Angelos and Pica could not be reached for comment.

Bob Gordon, a consultant to Baltimore attorney Joanne Lynch Suder, who filed
the original lawsuit on behalf of the Maryland doctor, said Mr. Angelos
agreed to be the co-counsel in a number of cases that Ms. Suder planned to
file against the phone industry.  Lawyers around the country also are working
on the planned litigation, he said.

Meanwhile last week, German researchers said there could be a link between
the use of mobile phones and cancer of the inner eye.  The results were
published in the January issue of the research journal Epidemiology.

But the researchers, who interviewed 118 subjects with eye cancer and a
control group of 475 people, said their findings were inconclusive because of
the study's limitations.  In a statement, CTIA cited those limitations and
the small size of the study group.

NTIA Proposes Reimbursement Procedures For Relocated Government Spectrum Users

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration is proposing
procedures for relocating federal government spectrum incumbents to other
bands to make way for commercial users.  Among the issues to be decided are
the circumstances under which incumbents will be required to relocate and
which relocation costs will be eligible for reimbursement.

NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said the rules could bolster a high-level
effort to identify and allocate spectrum for third-generation (3G) wireless
services.  Then-President Clinton launched the initiative by executive
memorandum in October 2000 (TR, Oct. 16, Nov. 6, and Nov. 20, 2000; and Jan.
8).

As part of that effort, NTIA is studying the possible use of the 1755-1850
megahertz band, which is used heavily by the Defense Department.  The FCC is
analyzing use of the 2500-2690 MHz band, which is used mostly by multichannel
multipoint distribution service and instructional television fixed service
operators.

NTIA's proposed rules would cover such future reallocations, Mr. Rohde said
at an industry-government meeting on the 3G plan last week.  He said he hoped
the final rules would be released this summer.

The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 required private
entities to reimburse federal spectrum users for the cost of relocating or
modifying their systems because of reallocation.  The notice of proposed
rulemaking NTIA released Jan. 17 suggests ways to implement that mandate.
Comments are due March 19 with replies due April 18 in docket no.
001206341-0341-01.

In its rulemaking notice, NTIA seeks comments on whether federal government
spectrum incumbents should be required to relocate if sharing is technically
possible in their present bands.

If the incumbents are not required to relocate, under what conditions should
they be permitted to remain in their current bands and who would pay for any
system modifications that would improve spectrum sharing? NTIA asks.  For
example, it asks, should the federal incumbent be allowed to stay in the band
on a noninterference basis with 3G systems?

NTIA suggests that federal incumbents not be forced to relocate until a "
comparable facility" is available for a reasonable period of time.  It
defines comparable facility as one that has the same or superior operational
capabilities as the original spectrum.  NTIA suggests using four factors to
determine comparability:  (1) communications throughput, (2) system
reliability, (3) operating costs, and (4) operational capability.  It seeks
comments on its definition and whether the four factors are sufficient.

NTIA outlines which relocation costs should be eligible for reimbursement.
It also suggests a process for resolving differences over those costs,
including a mandatory negotiation period, third-party mediation, and
nonbinding arbitration.

NTIA seeks comments on what type of cost-sharing plan to adopt and asks
whether a "band manager" or some other entity should serve as a clearinghouse
to administer the plan.  And it wants input on whether it should "sunset" a
cost-sharing plan five years after any auction of former government
spectrum.  The rulemaking notice also seeks comment on how to treat spectrum
with classified frequency assignments.

At the direction of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, NTIA identified 255 MHz of spectrum that can be
reallocated from federal government to private use.  The bands identified for
which federal incumbents would qualify for reimbursement are 216-220 MHz,
1432-1435 MHz, 1710-1755 MHz, and 2385-2390 MHz.

The FCC has proposed allocating the 1710-1755 MHz band for 3G services.  In
addition, Mr. Rohde said the reimbursement rules would apply to the 1755-1850
MHz band if federal incumbents there are relocated under the 3G initiative.

Rohde Uncertain of Effort's Future

At last week's 3G meeting, Mr. Rohde said he didn't know if the Bush
administration would make any changes to the 3G effort, which is operating on
a tight schedule that calls for the FCC to issue licenses for 3G spectrum by
Sept. 30, 2002.  But he said he had stressed its importance in his dealings
with Bush transition team staff members.  "I can't predict what's going to
happen" beyond Inauguration Day, Mr. Rohde told reporters.

The Bush transition team staff member responsible for NTIA, James Derderian,
a former Republican staff director of the House Commerce Committee, couldn't
be reached for comment.  But at his confirmation hearing for Commerce
secretary earlier this month, Donald L. Evans said the Bush administration
was committed to finding 3G spectrum (TR, Jan. 8).

Industry Expresses Frustration

At last week's meeting, several industry representatives expressed
frustration that they didn't have access to data they said they needed to
make recommendations on use of the 1755-1850 MHz and 2500-2690 MHz bands in
time for NTIA and the FCC to consider.  Industry representatives in
NTIA-established working groups are reviewing the bands.

The 3G initiative calls for final reports on the two bands to be released in
March, with the FCC issuing an order allocating the selected spectrum in July.

Rick Kemper, director-wireless technology and security for the Cellular
Telecommunications & Internet Association, said determining the cost of
relocating incumbents or whether band sharing or segmentation was feasible
requires information on how many systems operate in the frequencies and how
they are being used.  But he said that data wasn't available.

Donald Brittingham, director-wireless policy for Verizon Wireless, said he
was concerned that the final band studies wouldn't reflect all the industry's
input.  He urged the regulators to delay releasing the reports.

"One concern is we're going to do a lot of work and in the end it will be too
late to be included in your final report," added Joanne C. Wilson,
director-global public affairs for Lucent Technologies, Inc.

Frederick R. Wentland, NTIA's director-spectrum plans and policies, said some
information wouldn't  be available until the final band studies were
released.  "Unfortunately, time happens to be our enemy here," Mr. Wentland
added.

But he urged industry officials to continue participating in the process,
including filing comments in response to the FCC's recent notice of proposed
rulemaking on 3G spectrum (TR, Jan. 8).

Diane J. Cornell, associate chief of the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications
Bureau, said the current process was designed "to crystalize the issues," and
she urged industry engineers to focus on technical issues concerning band
sharing and segmentation.

Ms. Cornell also said industry should submit comments in response to NTIA's
notice and an FCC rulemaking notice released in November 2000 suggesting
allocations for 27 MHz of spectrum transferred from government to private use
(TR, Nov. 27, 2000).

After the final band studies are released in March, she said, "I expect there
will be differences of perspectives."  She said industry officials would get
another chance to submit comments after that.

Antenna-Rule Violations Prompt Proposed Forfeitures of $327K

The FCC and its Enforcement Bureau have proposed that two wireless carriers
and two tower companies pay $327,000 for violations of its antenna rules.

The largest proposed forfeiture was against American Tower Corp. for 36
violations in 14 states and Washington, D.C.  The FCC has ordered the
Enforcement Bureau to conduct a more thorough investigation of American Tower'
s compliance with its rules.

Separately, the Enforcement Bureau proposed an $80,000 forfeiture against
Telecorp Communications, Inc.; an $18,000 forfeiture against AT&T Wireless
Services, Inc.; and an $17,000 forfeiture against SpectraSite Corp.

In a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture, the FCC said American Tower
failed to (1) properly light an antenna during construction, (2) register two
existing antennas, (3) notify the agency of ownership changes involving 24
antennas, and (4) post registration numbers on nine antennas.

"We are concerned that ATC continues to violate our rules despite both oral
and written warnings regarding the Commission's antenna structure
requirements," the FCC said in its Jan. 16 forfeiture notice.  It said more
than half of American Tower's 36 violations were uncovered after a July 2000
meeting between FCC field agents and American Tower officials.

In separate notices released the same day, the Enforcement Bureau found that
Telecorp failed to light antennas properly on four occasions and that AT&T
Wireless failed to post antenna registration numbers on nine occasions.  It
also found that SpectraSite failed to post antenna registration numbers on
four occasions and failed to notify the FCC of ownership changes on three
occasions.  The violations were discovered by FCC field agents during routine
investigations and inspections.

Russell Wilkerson, director-corporate affairs for TeleCorp PCS, Inc., told TR
, "We're talking to our folks in the field. . .to compare the cases by the
FCC and some of their findings and then we will respond to them."  He added, "
We make it a practice to follow the FCC rules and regulations."  Spokesman
for the three other companies could not be reached for comment.

Fifth Circuit Joins Chorus On State Immunity Issue

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans), echoing three
other appellate circuits, has ruled that the U.S. Constitution doesn't
protect state utility commissions from federal judicial review of their
decisions regarding carrier interconnection agreements.

In a two-to-one decision issued Jan. 16, the Fifth Circuit rejected 11th
Amendment immunity claims raised by the Louisiana Public Service Commission
during proceedings stemming from a lawsuit filed by AT&T Corp.  AT&T was
challenging the PSC's 1997 arbitration decision regarding its interconnection
agreement with BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.

Section 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed state commissions
to review, approve, and, when necessary, arbitrate carrier interconnection
agreements.  The Act also says that parties aggrieved by state commission
determinations in carrier interconnection proceedings can ask the appropriate
federal district court to the review the carrier agreement.

In AT&T Communications v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., et al. (case
no. 99-30421), the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by the U.S. District Court
in Baton Rouge.  The lower court had held that the 11th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution prohibited such lawsuits against state agencies or employees.
(AT&T had named the PSC and its individual commissioners in the lawsuit).

The 11th Amendment grants states immunity from being sued in federal courts.
But states may lose that immunity under an exception carved out by the U.S.
Supreme Court in its 1908 decision in Ex parte Young.  The Ex parte Young
doctrine allows lawsuits against state employees in order to prevent ongoing
violations of federal law.

The Fifth Circuit found that the PSC and the commissioners had waived their
constitutional sovereign immunity rights by agreeing to arbitrate the
interconnection dispute under the provisions of the 1996 Act.  The court also
ruled that the Ex parte Young doctrine applied to AT&T's request for
prospective injunctive relief from PSC arbitration rulings that AT&T had
argued contravened the interconnection requirements of sections 251 and 252
of the Act.

The appeals court reversed the district court's ruling and remanded the case
for further proceedings.  Circuit Judge James L. Dennis wrote the opinion and
was joined by Judge Henry A. Politz.  Judge Jerry E. Smith dissented from the
majority's opinion.

Finding Echoes Other Circuits

Appeals courts in the Sixth, Seventh, and 10th Circuits already have held
that the Ex parte Young exception applies to federal court challenges to
state commission decisions affecting carrier interconnection agreements (TR,
April 5 and Oct. 25, 1999; and Jan. 24, June 26, and July 31, 2000).  Last
fall, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the issue in a case arising in
the Sixth Circuit (TR, Oct. 9, 2000).

In his dissent, Judge Smith cited the U.S. Supreme Court's 1996 decision in
Seminole Tribe v. Florida.  Under that ruling, he said, Congress' referral of
disputes surrounding state commission-arbitrated interconnection agreements "
supplants" a party's ability to sue the state commission under the 1908
Supreme Court decision in Ex parte Young.  But, he added, Congress' referral
of such disputes to the federal courts violates the 11th Amendment to the
Constitution.

The Chicago-based Seventh Circuit rejected a similar argument last year in
which state utility commissioners had invoked Seminole Tribe (TR, July 31,
2000).

AeA Seeking Federal Preemption Of Multiple State Privacy Laws

Lawmakers in the 107th Congress should make federal preemption of multiple
state privacy laws "one of the top legislative concerns" for the coming
session, according to AeA, formerly the American Electronics Association.
Federal privacy legislation "should play a crucial role" in maintaining
consistency and certainty" in the marketplace, said William T. Archer, AeA's
president and chief executive officer.

Mr. Archer warned, however, that "poorly crafted legislation" could have the
unintended effect of "imposing burdensome, impractical new requirements" on
e-commerce and Internet businesses.  "Only the federal government is in a
position to create uniform U.S. privacy standards and work for international
harmonization," he said.  "Otherwise, online business could face 50
conflicting sets of privacy rules.  Consumers and businesses alike would
lose."

AeA urged lawmakers Jan. 18 to consider its "privacy principles" in drafting
federal preemption legislation.  The principles recommend creating uniform,
technology-neutral national standards to protect privacy.

AeA wants standards to require merchants to notify consumers of
information-collection practices, while allowing them to "opt out of the use
or disclosure" of information if it's unrelated to the initial transactions
between consumers and merchants.

The AeA principles also urge lawmakers to build on private-sector privacy
seal programs and privacy codes while relying on the Federal Trade Commission'
s existing authority to enforce data-collection notice requirements.

Libraries Mull Legal Challenge To New Internet-Filtering Law

The American Library Association (ALA) has been given the green light from
its executive board to launch a court challenge of the Children's Internet
Protection Act (CIPA)  The law passed last year (TR, June 12, 2000) requires
schools and libraries to install Internet- filtering software if they use
federal funds-such as universal service "E-rate" support-to purchase
computers or connect to the Internet.

ALA said its executive board had authorized the legal action "after more than
a week of intense discussions among leaders and members during the
association's annual midwinter meeting."

ALA announced Jan. 18 that it was "researching and exploring its options in
preparation for litigation," as it believes the law infringes on freedoms
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The First Amendment protects free exercise of religion, free speech, freedom
of the press, freedom to assemble, and freedom to petition the government for
redress of grievances.

The Internet-filtering requirements would affect three federal funding
streams that libraries frequently use to purchase computer equipment or
connect to the Internet, ALA said.  They are the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act, the Library Services and Technology Act, and the E-rate
program.

"All three programs help ensure schools and libraries provide access to the
resources communities need to thrive in the Information Age," ALA said.  "
CIPA runs counter to these federal efforts to close the digital divide for
all Americans."

Think Tank Slams City Telecom Efforts

Through government-owned telecom networks, some states and cities are trying
to make sure their constituents don't have to wait for advanced telecom
services.  But such efforts are counterproductive, according to a paper
released by the Progress & Freedom Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

"Governments that have entered the telecom-munications business have been
saddled with financial losses and obsolete, legacy technologies.
Furthermore, government entry in the marketplace distorts incentives and
slows the development of private-sector competition," writes PFF President
Jeffrey A. Eisenach, author of Does Government Belong in the Telecom Business?

He views the pace of state and local government entry into telecom and
Internet service businesses as "rapid and increasing," citing efforts by
municipally owned utilities on Long Island, N.Y.; in Los Angeles; and in
Chicago.  The paper lists 233 municipal utilities that were providing one or
more of the following services in 1998:

Cable TV,

Internet access,

High-speed data,

Broadband data resale,

Local telephony,

Long distance services,

Leased fiber, and

Municipal data network services.

Of these services, the most commonly offered by municipalities is cable TV
service, according to the PFF findings.  Eighty-seven cities offered cable TV
service, compared with 73 cities that run data networks and 61 that provide
Internet access.  Only 18 cities were found to be offering local telephony,
and 10 cities offered long distance service.

Seven states had 11 or more cities offering telecom services:  22 cities in
Iowa, including Cedar Falls; 16 cities in Minnesota; 12 cities in Georgia; 12
cities in Missouri, including Columbia and Springfield; 11 cities in Florida,
including Gainesville and Tallahassee; 11 cities in Massachusetts; and 11
cities in Texas, including Brownsville and College Station.

Verizon Adds Data To Boost Massachusetts InterLATA Bid

Officials at Verizon New England are counting on new data to satisfy
regulators' concerns about its application to provide interLATA (local access
and transport area) services in Massachusetts.  Early last week, Verizon
again asked the FCC to allow it to enter that market; late last month, the
company withdrew a similar pending application it had filed last fall.

The officials are hoping the new data will answer questions regulators raised
about last fall's application, including whether the telco provides
nondiscriminatory access to DSL (digital subscriber line)- capable loops (TR,
Dec. 25, 2000).

Under section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a Bell company must
obtain FCC approval before providing in-region interLATA services.  The FCC
must determine whether the company has met a 14-point "competitive checklist"
of market-opening mandates laid out in the Act.

Thomas J. Tauke, Verizon's senior vice president-external affairs and public
policy, said that the new filing "demonstrates that we provide
nondiscriminatory access to lines other DSL providers lease from us, as well
as parity of service for installation and repair."

FCC Chairman William E. Kennard had focused on Verizon's provisioning of
DSL-capable loops when the company withdrew its original Massachusetts
application.  He cautioned Verizon that it should include in a new
application "verified data reflecting acceptable levels of performance,
including an independent showing for loops used to provide advanced services."

But competitors aren't so sure that the new application addresses those
concerns-and other concerns raised in comments to the FCC.  Verizon "still
didn't get it right," AT&T Corp. Vice President-federal government affairs
Len Cali said, adding that the "refiled application has failed to adequately
address the shortcomings of the original application."  AT&T particularly
objected to Verizon's prices for unbundled network elements, saying they
still weren't cost-based, as required by the Act.

Verizon included in its application last week new rates for switched services
provided to competitors in Massachusetts.  It had informed the FCC of the new
rates in ex parte filings regarding the earlier application.  Competitors had
complained that the FCC shouldn't consider those rates in reviewing the
earlier application because they were submitted after comment deadlines in
the proceeding.  "Refiling puts to rest any concerns that interested parties
did not have the opportunity to comment on all the issues," Mr. Tauke said.

The FCC now has 90 days to consider the new application.  Under section 271,
it must consult with Massachusetts regulators and the Department of Justice
before issuing a decision.  Justice had given Verizon's original application
a thumbs-down (TR, Oct. 30, 2000).  The Massachusetts Department of
Telecommunications and Energy had recommended that the FCC approve it (TR,
Oct. 23, 2000).

The DTE's recommendation to the FCC is due Feb. 6; Justice must submit its
recommendation by Feb. 21.  Comments and replies are due to the FCC by Jan.
30 and Feb. 28, respectively.  Parties also are invited to meet with Common
Carrier Bureau staff for ex parte discussions about the proceeding between
Jan. 30 and Feb. 23.

Bureau Proposes SBC Pay $94K For Violating Collocation Rules

The FCC's Enforcement Bureau has found SBC Communications, Inc., apparently
liable for violating Commission rules regarding competitors' collocation of
equipment in incumbents' central offices.  Specifically, the bureau says SBC
failed to update its Web site to identify facilities that have run out of
physical collocation space.

In a Jan. 18 notice of apparent liability (file EB-00-IH-0326a), the bureau
proposed that SBC forfeit $94,500 for the alleged infraction, which the
bureau uncovered during an "independent audit."  The FCC made the audit a
condition of its approval of license transfers related to the merger of SBC
Communications, Inc., and Ameritech Corp. (TR, Oct. 11, 1999).

The FCC's "posting rule" requires incumbent local exchange carriers to update
their Web sites to list premises that run out of space for competitors to
install facilities.  They must provide those updates within 10 days of using
up the space.  But information provided by SBC to the bureau indicates that
in "numerous instances" SBC failed to provide timely updates to its Web site.

SBC has 30 days to pay the $94,500 or file a written statement showing why
the proposed forfeiture should be eliminated or reduced.

FCC Gets `Ahead of the Curve' With Inquiry on Interactive TV

Although the market for high-speed interactive TV (ITV) services is in the
early stages of development, the FCC hopes to get "ahead of the curve" by
collecting information on the status of the ITV market and whether it should
regulate it.

The FCC issued the notice of inquiry in Cable Services docket 01-7 because
comments in its recently completed proceeding on the America Online, Inc.-
Time Warner, Inc., merger (TR, Jan. 15) "raised the possibility" that a
vertically integrated cable TV and ITV service provider could discriminate
against alternative ITV service providers.  It asked for comments in the
docket 01-7 proceeding by March 19 and replies by April 20.

The inquiry seeks comment on what services constitute ITV services, how they
will be delivered, and other questions about the status of the ITV market.
The FCC acknowledged that it was "difficult to specify a definition" for ITV
services because of the technological and business changes in the new
industry.  It sought comment on its initial characterization of ITV as a "
service that supports subscriber-initiated choices or actions that are
related to one or more video programming streams.."

The FCC asked about the technical resources or "building blocks" a
distribution system would require to support ITV.  The FCC said it saw three
major building blocks:  (1) a video stream, (2) a two-way high-speed Internet
protocol connection, and (3) specialized customer premises equipment.

"To assess the possibilities for discriminatory behavior and what enforcement
procedures might be effective for any rules that might be proposed in the
future, it is important to understand clearly how ITV providers will deliver
their services to consumers, including what type of contractual arrangements
will govern," the FCC said.

It also asked whether cable TV providers would have the "superior platform"
for distribution of high-speed ITV service and sought comment on the ITV
capabilities of direct broadcast satellite providers and digital subscriber
line service providers.  The FCC also sought comment on the legal
classifications of ITV services, what public and statutory objectives ITV
rules would promote, and what authority the FCC has over such services.

The notice states that the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992 directed the FCC to adopt rules "limiting the share
of cable capacity that could be used for commonly owned content and requiring
vertically integrated cable programmers to provide their content to rival
distribution platforms on nondiscriminatory terms."  The FCC added that if
the "same factual predicates that Congress cited in the 1992 Cable Act were
to apply to a distribution platform delivering ITV services, then some
regulation of those distribution facilities might be warranted."

The notice also asks for comment on how the FCC could implement rules to bar
providers of multichannel video programming from discriminating against
unaffiliated ITV providers.  It asked for comment on how nondiscrimination
rules should be enforced.  It suggested that ITV providers and cable TV
operators "rely on private enforcement arrangements" or that aggrieved
parties use the FCC's complaint procedures.

Kennard Warns against Discrimination

Then-FCC Chairman William E. Kennard acknow-ledged that ITV services were in
the "early stages of development" but said the FCC would "do well to get
ahead of the curve."  He said it was "clear" that cable TV would be an "
important platform for delivery of ITV services, at least in the near term,
and I am concerned that a vertically integrated ITV service provider might
have the incentive and ability to discriminate against unaffiliated ITV
service providers."

Commissioner Gloria Tristani supported the inquiry but "regretted" that the
FCC issued an inquiry rather than a notice of proposed rulemaking.  "This
Commission must move promptly to ascertain the public interest in nascent
industries to ensure appropriate measures are timely vetted and resolved,"
she said.

Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth dissented from the FCC's decision,
saying it was "premature" to address the issue of cable interactive TV
services.  "While the item is framed as a notice of inquiry, it is no less
damaging to raise the specter of government regulation. . .for services that
are still in their gestational period."  He said he had "serious
reservations" about the FCC's legal authority to address ITV issues.

Robert Sachs, president and chief executive officer of the National Cable
Television Association, was "pleased" that the FCC was launching an inquiry
rather than a "rulemaking which presumes a regulatory outcome."  But he added
that "asking dozens of hypothetical questions about regulating a business
which has yet to take form still puts the cart before the horse, in
regulatory terms. . .There is no evidence to suggest that government
regulation is called for here."

Analysts See Shifting Alliance As BellSouth Sells Qwest Stock

It was the rumor du jour 21 months ago:  BellSouth Corp.'s purchase of a 10%
stake in Qwest Communications International, Inc., meant the companies might
merge.  Times have changed, however, and BellSouth now is cashing in much of
its Qwest investment to raise $1 billion for other projects.

"The transaction underscores a change in the direction of the relationship
between Qwest and BellSouth," said Marion Boucher Soper, a Bear, Stearns &
Co. analyst, in a Jan. 16 report.  "While both appear to be interested in
strategic expansion, other opportunities are likely to be higher on the
priority list."

BellSouth's 10% stake already has been diluted to about 5% by Qwest's
acquisition of U S WEST, Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Adam Quinton
noted.  "The gradual dilution and now sell down of the BellSouth stake speaks
to the changing nature of the relationship between the two," Mr. Quinton said
in a report also issued Jan. 16.

"BellSouth seems to be indicating it has other strategic priorities and that
securing a strong relationship with a leading `next-gen' long distance
provider can be done via commercial relationships, which do not need the
backing of any equity position," Mr. Quinton said.

"Realistically, BellSouth's investment in Qwest is not strategic to its
long-term growth strategy, and the $1 billion in proceeds will give it cash
on hand," said Goldman, Sachs & Co. analysts Kathryn D. Willing and Frank J.
Governali.

"We were a very different company two years ago when they invested in us,"
said Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman and chief executive officer.  If
BellSouth now needs cash instead of Qwest stock, Mr. Nacchio said, "I'm glad
to be strong enough now to be able to help out."

The transaction satisfies both companies' needs, analysts said.  It gives
BellSouth a cash infusion to spend on deployment of digital subscriber line
service and on its wireless initiatives in the U.S. and Latin America.

Qwest, on the other hand, gains the opportunity to boost its stock value, Mr.
Quinton said.  "Qwest's management is clearly sending a signal to the market
that the company's stock is undervalued at current levels," he said.

The sale of 22.22 million Qwest shares back to Qwest will leave BellSouth
with 52 million shares, or a 3% stake in Qwest.  BellSouth agreed to hold
those shares until Jan. 16, 2002, except for 11 million shares it can sell
after Feb. 16, 2001.

Qwest probably will not be the buyer if BellSouth decides to sell those 11
million shares, Mr. Nacchio said during a Jan. 16 conference call.  Qwest may
help BellSouth sell the shares to Qwest's independent pension fund, but Qwest
can't buy any more shares without running the risk of hurting its credit
rating, Mr. Nacchio suggested.

Qwest management consulted credit-rating agencies and decided $1 billion "was
a good number we could handle.  It wasn't going to put any burden on us," Mr.
Nacchio said.

Two credit-rating agencies agreed.  Qwest intends to fund the purchase by
issuing commercial paper, a short-term funding solution.  "The company has
adequate balance-sheet flexibility to absorb the additional debt," Standard &
Poor's said.  Moody's Investors Service said it was "comfortable that Qwest's
actions. . .are sensitive to the overall credit implications."

Despite the stock buyback, the relationship between the companies will
increase.  In addition to continuing its co-marketing agreement with Qwest
and using Qwest for long-haul transport, BellSouth will buy $250 million
worth of services from Qwest, paying   with Qwest shares.

Blaming Verizon for Bankruptcy, NorthPoint Plans Asset Auction

NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc., doesn't expect to emerge from
bankruptcy as an independent entity but has asked a bankruptcy court to allow
a "structured sale" of its assets.

"The purpose of our filing is to use the breathing room Chapter 11 provides
to sign an agreement with a financially sound strategic partner who is
interested in our world-class network," said Elizabeth A. Fetter, NorthPoint'
s president and chief executive officer, in a conference call with financial
analysts.

NorthPoint filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code
Jan. 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.
The filing follows a financial slide for which NorthPoint largely blames
Verizon Communications, Inc.  In November 2000, Verizon canceled plans to
acquire 55% of NorthPoint and provide $350 million in financing (TR, Dec. 4,
2000).

NorthPoint has laid off workers, scaled back operations, and sold stakes in
joint ventures in Europe and Canada, but those moves apparently weren't
enough to keep the company solvent.  In conjunction with its bankruptcy
filing, the company obtained agreements for as much as $38 million in "
debtor-in-possession" financing to continue operations.

"The company's available cash only funds its operations for a few weeks,"
said Kenneth Hoexter, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co.  "Even with the
nearly $12 million in cash received through recent divestitures, we believe
that the company has virtually run out of additional funds to keep operations
running."

"The only surprise for most investors in this bankruptcy filing was that it
wasn't announced sooner given the critical funding situation at NorthPoint,"
Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. analyst Mark Kastan said in a Jan. 17 report.

"With NorthPoint's assets now officially on the block, look for a number of
telecom companies to express an interest," Mr. Kastan said.  Potential
bidders include McLeodUSA, Inc., XO Communications, Inc., and any
interexchange carrier that needs more local broadband infrastructure, Mr.
Kastan said.

NorthPoint's condition has raised new doubts about the other major "data
CLECs" (competitive local exchange carriers)-Rhythms NetConnections, Inc.,
and Covad Communications Group, Inc.-whose business models depend largely on
deployment of DSL (digital subscriber line) service.

"Although both Rhythms NetConnections and Covad Communications have enough
cash to last for several more quarters, we believe it will be extremely
difficult for either of these companies to obtain additional financing," Mr.
Kastan said.  "We expect significant scale-back initiatives-in addition to
those already announced-from both of them."  Covad already has taken steps to
conserve cash, and Rhythms announced similar steps last week (see separate
story).

Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Daniel P. Reingold noted that the downfall
of the data CLECs had left Bell companies and independent incumbent telcos
well positioned to attack the market for high-speed Internet access.

"A year ago investors had genuine fear that DSL CLECs, using the FCC's highly
discounted UNE [unbundled network elements] and line-sharing rates, would be
able to profitably take significant share" from Bell companies and
independent incumbent local exchange carriers, Mr. Reingold said in a Jan. 17
report.

"Now with NorthPoint in bankruptcy, Covad and Rhythms cutting back coverage
dramatically, AT&T [Corp.] and WorldCom [Inc.] nowhere in DSL, and Bell
companies ramping [up] DSL install rates, it is apparent the consumer
high-speed access market will be left to the cable [TV] and incumbent
telephone companies, and the small-business market to the latter," he said.

Qwest Touts Line-Sharing Pacts, Improved Service

Qwest Communications, Inc., has said it improved its service to end-user
customers and other carriers in 2000 in key areas-including those that have
come under fire from consumers and state regulators.

Qwest filled almost 98% of it service orders for 2000 on time, Afshin
Mohebbi, Qwest's president-worldwide operations, told reporters during a Jan.
15 conference call.  Ninety-five percent of local service repairs were
completed on time, Qwest's best performance in this category since 1996, he
said.  He also cited reductions in the percentage of customers whose service
was out for more than 24 hours and a decrease in "held or delayed" orders.

Last week, Qwest also unveiled permanent line-sharing agreements with
MULTIBAND Communications, Inc., New Edge Networks, NorthPoint Communications,
Inc., and Contact Communications.  Line-sharing agreements enable competitors
to use the high-frequency portion of the loop for data transmission while
Qwest continues to pr
