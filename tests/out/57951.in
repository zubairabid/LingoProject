Russell,
Thanks for the update.  Can you provide a rough quote/schedule to kit out the Louisiana space for 130 people - please contact Lillian Carroll to get an exact count.   We don't need recorded phones.  Also please lay out a schematic of the  hardware configuration between Enron, Louisiana and AEP's offices for this solution.

Deborah,
Can you provide Lillian with a floor plan so that she can start locating the HPL staff by function.  Also, what do you recommend regarding furniture?  We should be able to come up with an interim solution based on the space coming available in 3 Allen or any additional furniture we have in warehouses or in the Louisiana bldg.  Your thoughts on cost for this?

Once we have a plan/schedule I will follow up with AEP to let them know of our plans.  They already know we are headed in this direction, given their delay in leasing space.

Regards,
Brian
