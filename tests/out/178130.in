Some of the interconnection agreements that we are looking at, have metrics
for performance.  However, those metrics are specific to how the ILEC
performs with regard to the CLEC.  I believe those metrics are confidential
between the parties to the interconnection agreement.  Once we sign
agreements, we will receive reports from the ILECs on their performance
relative to us, in a very limited way.  We would not receive information
relative to that ILECs performance for any other carrier.
