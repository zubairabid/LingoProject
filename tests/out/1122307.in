Effective October 1, 2001,  Sitara added new trading zones to the Koch (Gulf South) pipeline.  All affected deals in Sitara have been modified to reflect the correct area and zone so that Koch now appears balanced by area and zone in the Position Manager.  In order to facilitate the continuation of the "clean" positions on Koch, please refer to the attached list of meter numbers with their respective area and zones when creating, adding or changing deal tickets on Koch. If you are unable to find the meter you are looking for within this spreadsheet, please advise and I will locate the information.

Thank you in advance for your adherence and careful attention to maintaining the integrity of the Koch positions.
