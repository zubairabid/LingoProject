Today's Washington Post contains a favorable comment on negawatts attributed
to House Energy & Commerce Committee Chairman Tauzin, following efforts we
made yesterday with the Chairman and his staff, both directly and via our
consultants.  The Post article reads, "In the coming months, Tauzin said,
Congress will take steps to allow consumers to sell power back to their local
energy grids."  We, of course, will continue to push for a version of this
concept that keeps this process open to multiple buyers and sellers, not just
the local utility.  The article dovetails with information directly from
Chairman Tauzin and Chairman Barton that they will continue to push our
demand buydown proposal, although we are working with them to shore up
support on the committee in the face of opposition from the usual suspects.
