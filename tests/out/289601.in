In order to keep the Pipeline Flow database as current as possible, and to help out Catalina and Sachin with the migration of their reports, I have reloaded the IHS_PIPELINE_METER table in the FDYPIPELINEDEV database.  It now contains data from the April 24, 2001 CD (as given to me by Tara).

Let me know of any questions/concerns.

Thanks,
Chris
