To all:

As part of Karen Gruesen's ongoing efforts to clean up the Bridgeline Income Statement and Balance sheet, she has been tracking the various receivables that have not been paid.  Karen has been working with Trevor Mihalik (CFO) and it is expected that the majority will be paid by the end of this month.  Unfortunately,  Bridgeline had not been receiving appropriate documentation with their billings.

For any further information, please contact Karen Grusen at 36571.

Thank you.

Jean
