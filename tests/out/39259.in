Since Lisa used fuchsia, I'll use lavender..
On # 1 I would eliminate that processing. In addition, can we delete/hide/not access old paths that haven't been used in gas production in lets say a year or so. Would this help performance?  This would also force the schedulers to path/think about the way they are pathing their transactions and not rely on old paths that may no longer be accurate!! We've seen old bad, zero paths be re-used accidentally.
On # 2, The scheduling position window IS the weakest link.....GOODBYE!
On # 3, Contract Reference I know is used alot in the supply and market list. Nomlogic is also slated to use these contract reference fields for comments. Do we need it in the inventory list?  Probably not as much as the supply and market list but I still believe it's necessary for pools and imbalance accounts.
On # 4, We use this functionality alot on CGAS, TENN, TRCO and SAB...When we path one to many or many to one in "chunks," it does seem to go faster than one path at a time.
On # 5,  Brokered paths could really just be slammed in there. No need for the extra processing that occurs for service contracts .
THANKS
