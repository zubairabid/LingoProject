John,
It is not relevant that it is not standard practice within ETS to grant origination for closed deals.  On ECF's behalf, Bilberry and Hilgert negotiated a storage transaction that brings significant value to your business for which they should be appropriately compensated and rewarded. Also, the PRC process within business units is often not an appropriate mechanism to validate a person's P&L for transactions closed across business subsidiaries of Enron.
The value associated with the storage transaction was indeed a significant component of P&L to the overall Formosa deal.  I do not understand how you could infer that the deal was worth over $50 million to Enron.  At best, the current value of the closed transaction across EGM, ECF and ENA is under $10 million.  In addition, EGM did compensate Bilberry and Hilgert for their origination efforts associated with the unwind of the TEPPCO contract and incremental transportation volumes from Williams.
I certainly hope we can work out this P&L issue to incentive employees to work on transactions across business lines.
Regards, Jean
