From time to time we have applicants from other shops that interview with our desk for RT trading, scheduling, or other positions.
If you recognize someone from another firm,  or know who they are,  do not discuss their interest in Enron with anyone else.

Recently,  we have had two applicants who have reported that others at their firm knew that they had interviewed with Enron.  Both felt that someone in this shop had discussed their visit here.    Totally unacceptable.     I have to ensure that this information is not coming from  my group, hence this note.

Common sense would dictate that discretion is necessary in these situations.   If you have any feedback on this situation I would like to hear it.

Thanks for your attention to this very important issue.
