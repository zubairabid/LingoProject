Arrangements have been made for a fun day out of the office on Friday, August 10, for the West Power Administrative staff as an appreciation for their hard work.  Kathy Axford, Jill Chatterton, Kathy Sheppard, Anna Mehrer, Erin Hall, and Emily Butler, and I will be out of the office starting at 11 a.m. for the rest of the day.  Sarah Clark and Sandy Ragnetti will be covering the administrative duties (answering phones, UPS preparation, copying, etc.) for the department.

Please see us before 11 a.m. on Friday if you will need administrative support with your projects, and contact Sarah or Sandy on Friday afternoon if you need administrative support.  Mollie has agreed to be available for extraordinary requests if they come up during our absence.  Thanks for your patience during our absence.  Contact me if you have any questions.

FYI--On Friday the Admin group will be lunching at Newport Bay Restaurant and then taking a two-hour Willamette Jetboat ride in the afternoon.  The weather will be perfect for it!
