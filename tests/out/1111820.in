Christi,

The NERC statements clearly seem to indicate they feel threatened by the RTO formation process and EISB.

Frankly, nothing stated anywhere in the attachments hasn't already been thought out and handled by the three ISOs in the East and the CAISO as well.  All four of these entities have fully functional back-up facilities in other parts of their regions and NERC is fully aware of them.  I would assume ERCOT also has a fully functional, redundant control scheme in place as well.

In the case of NY there is another site physically apart from the main control center which has a fully redundant computer and communications system.  They have (or used to have) plans which in the event neither center is available, can revert control back to the TOs (heaven forbid)  until ISO personnel can resume control of the grid.  So they have 3 sets of redundancy, in addition to radio and satellite communications if necessary.

Earlier RTO West discussions all contained similar concerns and plans for redundancy and the DSTAR preliminary design documents also plan on redundancy.  NERCs assertion that they would "slow-down" the RTO formation process is absurd (geez, it's going too slow now!!!).

Running distributed, synchronized computer networks is not rocket science...how do the folks at NERC explain the NYSE quick recovery from a ground zero attack?  There was no report of crippling loss of financial information...at least that I am aware of.  Even a small operation like APX operates their systems using distributed computing and synchronized data.

For NERC to use the NIMDA virus as a specific attack on the electrical grid operation and the compromising of reliability is preposterous and the resulting "service denials" cited are probably refusal(s) of tags, which from what I understand, the utilities probably cause much more self-inflicted havoc than this virus!

The press release you refer to just confirms NERC's position of maintaining status quo.  Should we "call" NERC on these statements?  The remarks made in these public statements seem irresponsible.

Kind Regards,

Dave
