Shelley and Steve,

As you know, we have been working with facilities to develop options to replace or improve our 75KVA UPS that provides power to the Gas Control environment. My recommendation at this time is that we stand pat with the current 75KVA UPS and the redundancy that we currently have in place. Given the uncertainties of the status and ownership of the 40KVA UPS on EB44, and given Mr. Cooper's stated intention of moving out of this building, it simply doesn't make sense to spend the $28K estimated to leverage the 40KVA UPS on EB44. I've talked with Randy Lord and he is comfortable with us continuing to rely on the 75KVA unit for the near term.

I do want to thank facilities for their efforts, particularly Charles Upshaw, who provided a great deal of assistance in reviewing what equipment was available and how we might leverage the equipment.

Let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

Thanks, Gary
