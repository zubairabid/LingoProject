As Enron finalizes plans for our child care center scheduled to open during
the 3rd quarter of next year, we are seeking input on 5 alternative
names/concepts for the naming of our center. If you've already given
feedback, THANKS!

If you have not, please take 5 minutes of your time to stop by EB 49C3 from
11-1 TODAY to give us your opinion.

Feel free to bring a friend! FREE cookies will be provided!

Please forward this email to any other Enron employees that may want to
provide their  input on the naming of the center.

We look forward to seeing you later today!

Regards,

Charla
