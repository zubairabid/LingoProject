I assume this meeting is strictly for Accenture and PWC to pitch their vision
to Enron on how they would help add value or help Enron execute mid/back
office and/or CommodityLogic in a commercial manner.  I don't want this
meeting related at all to Andy's efforts with Accenture related to
transaction feeds unless Andy thinks it is OK.

I have told Baldwin at Accenture that Mid/back office and CommodityLogic is
separate from what he is working on with Dave Samuals and Andy on Transaction
hubs and is separate from DealBench, etc.  If we are not careful, Accenture
will be working with four or five different points of contact at Net Works
and we will end up hurting ourselves.

I am counting on Salley, Rex, Andy and Tom ASAP to each understand what the
other is doing with Accenture and make sure there is no way Accenture can
work us to our disadvantage. I also think Accenture needs to earn our
business because others can do what they are offering.

Also, check with Rex Shelby on PWC.  We just had an uncomfortable experience
with PWC that everyone should understand.  I recommended an Accenture meeting
but if Tom wants PWC, he should understand what they did to Rex.

Remember, all of this is very confidential so let's be very careful
internally and no meetings without transaction specific NDAs.

Your thoughts?

I am out next week but will check voice mail daily at 36635.

Good luck.
