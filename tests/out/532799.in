The attached report summarizes the discussions at the subject technical
conference held in D.C. on July 18 and 19.  Copies of documents referenced in
the report are available on request.  Please let me know if you would like
any of them.
More was accomplished at the conference than I expected.  Note that a
follow-up conference is tentatively scheduled for August 28.  I think the
full requirements customers have finally gotten the message that they will
have to accept some defined level of service.  It was also clear that El Paso
does not have sufficient capacity to serve everybody,s full load all the time
and they will have to, at the least, credit demand charges when they cannot
serve their firm shippers, and may even be required to expand their system.
