Brief from today's (October 16) daily NERC Security Call:

NERC           -Continue in Alert level 2.5, something between full alert
status and heightened alert.
- CIPWG continues to work on level definitions.  Still a week or
two away from completion.

NIPC      - Reported possible bomb threat at Nuclear Plant in ERCOT.
However, ERCOT reports that security at Plant was unaware of threat.

DOE       - Continue at SECON level 3 modified.  Note:  SECON-3 is used
when an increased and more predictable threat of terrorist
activity exists and may increase access controls to include
additional personnel and vehicle barriers.

SC's      -A suspcious substance received in the mail forced a Mid-Atlantic
Electric Utility to evacuate their control center.  Local
authorities determined the substance to be non-toxic and allowed
all personel to return to the building.
-Two unidentified indivduals tried to gain access to a Midwest
EHV station via the station gate.  They escaped without being
apprehended.
-A Power Plant in the Southwest recieved a phone call in which
the caller stated "you are being watched."  The caller then
hanged-up.
-A Power Plant in the Southwest reported that two suspcious
people showed up at the Plant gate stating that they were college
students and that they wanted a tour of the Plant.  The security
guard refused them access and asked them to leave.  They refused
to leave.  The guard went to his truck to radio the situation in,
at which time the suspects fled.  Their vehicle had no plates on
the front and the guard was unable to read the rear plate.


ECAR/MET Security Coordinator suggests that ECAR members continue to
evaluate their security measures and take action that they deem appropriate
to protect the system and their investment.  ECAR/MET reminds the ECAR
members that if Federal Agencies discover that one of your facilities is
the target of a credible threat, that they will notify you directly of such
threat.  You are asked to notify the ECAR/MET Security Coordinator of any
and all suspicious activities that occur on or near critical transmission
facilities and power plants, as well as the appropriate law enforcement
authorities.
