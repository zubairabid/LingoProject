Attached is an updated spreadsheet for your review.  The second tab in the worksheet shows the the number of trades by counterparty, by product, that are affected by the letters we have sent.  We have received approx. 12 signed letters today.

Note:  Yesterday, Berry Petroleum was wanting to negotiate.  Today they signed the letter as it stands with no changes.
Also, see note on Newton Financial Corporation.  I will send Newton a copy of their confirmation as they are requesting.  I will also forward copies of their response letter to you as well as legal.


Call with any questions.
