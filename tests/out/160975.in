The CPUC is very aware that the utilities have gone to the legislature when
the UDCs face elimination of some of the advantages that they have in the
retail market.  We now have a fully-constituted commission (5 members) with
two new democratic appointees with close ties to the governor.  This may
empower the CPUC to take control of issues within their purvue, which
ratemaking and the PX credit, clearly are.  Some members of the legislature
are loathe to get into the CPUC's backyard and "micro-manage".  That being
said, we still face significant risk within the legislature.  We have Steve
Peace, who thinks a wholesale pass-through is adequate for competition, and
Rod Wright, the chair of the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee, who
sponsored a similar bill last year and who doesn't believe in retail
competition either.  We have our work cut out for us.
Last year we fought essentially the same battle and defeated the utilities at
attempts to include similar provisions into law for electricity.  We were
able to do so because we had a broad coalition of supporters, including the
environmental community.  Essentially, everyone opposed the utilities'
proposals.
This year we have a different scenario.  SCE is attempting to peel off
environmental groups by rolling in extension of the public purpose funding.
They are also talking to the large consumers, who may perceive that they are
able to get a better deal from the utilities by avoiding the mark-up.
However, it doesn't appear as though the utilities are united in supporting
SCE's language.  We are actively attempting to revive the coalition that was
so effective last year.  We are talking to the environmental groups to try
and keep them in the fold.  This can be done by keeping the two issues of
public purpose funding and competition as separate as possible.
We have been encouraged to settle the PX credit case by the judge.  We are
engaged in the beginning stages of settlement on the PX credit issue with
SDG&E.  We are a long way from settling, however, if we are successful, the
settlement would likely be precedential for both SCE and PG&E.  There is
significant room between the utility proposals for the "retail" portion of
the PX credit and what we are supporting.  We also appear to have the support
of the ratepayer advocates.  We are attempting to get the customer groups to
agree on an outcome, leaving the utilities isolated.  Adoption of our
proposal for the full retail adder is a long-shot.
From a timing perspective, it is possible that we will resolve this issue at
the PUC, before any legislation would become effective.  However, that would
not prevent the legislation from estopping the CPUC decision.
We could use the help of the business units in providing documented
information about the UDCs activities, if its available.  Customer accounts
are very credible, however most customers are unwilling to do that.  We may
also need some assistance from the business units in presenting testimony
when these issues go to hearing before the appropriate committees.
We are working on this issue and will report on any developments.  Thanks.
