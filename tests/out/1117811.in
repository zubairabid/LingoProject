Attached hereto are first drafts of the form of swap documents we propose to use in connection with the prepay transaction with Chase and Mahonia.  Since we do not have a Master ISDA in place with Mahonia, I have drafted the ENA/Mahonia confirmation in the form of a "deemed ISDA".

You will note that the business terms of the swaps as well as the calculation of collateral posting amounts have been left blank.  These will be filled in as soon as the parties have agreed to them.

Please be advised that none of the members of the business team at Enron have had a chance to review the form of documents attached hereto.  Therefore the documents remain subject to further change based on their input.

If you have any questions or comments, please contact me at your earliest convenience.
