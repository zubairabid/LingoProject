I received a call from Ralph Komai, PCB person for SoCal concerning new hits
of PCBs at regulator sites on the Southwest Gas system.  It appears that SWG
did some liquids sampling at two regulator locations near Victorville, Ca.
and found small volumes of liquid accumulations (less than 2 oz.).  They
tested the liquid for PCBs and found concentrations of 230 and 132 ppm.  The
aroclors for the two samples were not known at the time of Ralph's
notification to me but he stated that SWG plans to do further testing at
their other 17 regulator locations.  This additional testing will be
conducted in the near future and Ralph stated that he would share the results
of his sampling with me.  It should be noted that the location of the two
positive hits  were immediately downstream of where SoCal delivers gas to
SWG.
If we need to discuss this further, contact me at my home  (505) 624-0353 as
I am taking vacation during the month of December.
