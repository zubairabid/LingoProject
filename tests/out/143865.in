I noticed that there was one bio missing.  So here goes,

Eric Gillaspie:  28 Junior Attorney extradonaire for Enron North America,
wannabe Rock-n-Roll star.  Prone to performing at least one incredibly
embarassing act every time he goes out drinking including, but not limited
to, falling down in bars, kicking people on the dance floor with his
incredibly gay dance steps, and lapsing into siezures resulting in the
tossing of a full Gin&Tonic on senior attorneys.  Often mistaken for the cute
little guy in the movie "Jerry Maguire" (Dogs and Bees can smell fear) not
only because of his looks, but also his level of speech and depth of
conversation.  Thinks the Rolling Stones stole all of their best material
from BuckCherry and finally, "Our  dive captain".
