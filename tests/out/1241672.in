It's time to start thinking about when and where we can get together to
review the maintenance that will affect the San Juan area this year.  The
EPNG planners will have their information from the field, and we will review
it internally by the middle of February.  Can we look at late Feb or early
March?

We did not decide who would host this year's meeting when we departed last
year.  If anyone wants to volunteer, please say so.  We could consider
meeting at a neutral location (Las Vegas has been suggested).

I will coordinate our communications until someone volunteers to take the
ball.  Please e-mail your thoughts.

Thanks,
