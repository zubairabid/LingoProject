Michael,  Wanted to follow up our conversation today with a note summarizing
EPMI's thoughts.  I know neither of us thought that Garrard Hassan's analysis
would drag on this long (since end of November) so I thought it would be
appropriate to re-address where we are.  At this point, I think EPMI is
looking for two things from EWC:

1) We understand EWC's concern with Garrard Hassan and the affect their
estimates for wind speed have on the economics of the Indian Mesa project,
but EPMI needs EWC to place a deadline on when EWC will have enough
information in order to sign the agreements.  My expectation is this should
be in the next two weeks (after another meeting with Garrard Hassan)?

The reason for this request is that opportunities for EPMI to resell some of
its renewable energy position (should EWC sign the agreement) are now
starting to appear in the market and those opportunities will be lost if EPMI
is unable to consummate.  Also, as you know, the power market is volatile and
any large movement could quickly kill the economics of our PPA from Indian
Mesa.  Lastly,  EPMI will soon need to make decisions regarding dedicating
time and money in preparation for accepting and managing the intermittent
wind power.  Bottom line is that the deal's value will start to decay the
longer delay in EWC's signing.

2) EPMI expects EWC to not compete with EPMI on renewable energy
opportunities in Texas (specifically the Austin Energy RFP).  EPMI has in
good faith negotiated this agreement with EWC and needs to be able to pursue
these opportunities with EWC's cooperation in anticipation that EPMI will
have a signed PPA from Indian Mesa.

At your earliest convenience could you please give me a call to address these
concerns.

Thanks, - Mike
