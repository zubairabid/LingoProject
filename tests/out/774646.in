Michelle,

I have been working with Diane Goode over the past two months regarding the
online computer based compliance training that we provide. I understand that
moving forward Diane has asked me to follow up directly with you in regards
to the project.

I will be in Houston on the 29th - 30th of this month if their is a need for
us to meet to discuss the project. As of late Diane has informed me that you
still need to view the courseware prior to moving forward. Please let me
know if I can assist in this area. I will follow up with you by weeks end to
get a update from you regarding the project.

I look forward to speaking soon.
