PG&E has taken the position in the issues matrix from the June 13 meeting
that the proposal made by PowerSpring, of using actual consumption of
end-use customers with AMR devices installed for measuring their compliance
with OFO/EFOs, is not part of the Gas OII Settlement.  PG&E expressed no
opinion on the merits of PowerSpring's proposal, but said it could be raised
in the OFO forum.  PowerSpring explained why we believe this issue is within
the scope of the Gas OII Settlement in our prior comments.
PowerSpring continues to believe that its proposal is within the scope of
the current settlement discussions and does not withdraw it from
consideration.  In light of PG&E's position, however, PowerSpring intends to
pursue its proposal in the OFO forum and others until it is adopted on
satisfactory terms.

1. RULE 14-CAPACITY ALLOCATION AND CONSTRAINT OF NATURAL GAS SERVICE

PowerSpring, Inc. previously submitted proposed changes to Rule 14, Sections
E, F and G to allow use of actual usage data from AMR devices for Core
Procurement Groups to determine compliance with and noncompliance charges
for OFO/EFOs and Involuntary Diversions.  See Section 2 of comments
submitted May 22, 2000.  PG&E responded in # 31 of the Resolution Matrix
that the Settlement "does not contemplate development of meter, AMR, and
meter data handling."  Two parts of the Settlement Agreement do, at least
implicitly, contemplate usage of actual data in the ways PowerSpring
proposes.
Section 2.9.1 states the Commission's belief that customers' access to real
time data regarding their gas consumption will "increase efficiency" and
provide "competitive tools," and may help them "better manage their pipeline
flows."  The Commission also considers the "most promising option" is for
UDCs to make the equipment, technology and training necessary for timely
customer access to current consumption information available to customers.
The Meter Add-On Pilot Program agreed to in Section 2.10.5 is one
implementation of these Commission policies, but customer access to real
time consumption information provided by Add-On devices has little value
unless the customers and PG&E actually use it when it is most needed, such
as during OFO/EFOs.  Thus, the Meter Add-On Pilot and the Commission's
policies, at least implicitly, contemplate that the real time data will be
not only made available, but will actually be used to enable customers to
better manage and balance their gas supplies and consumption, particularly
during critical times of system stress such as OFO/EFOs.  PowerSpring's
proposals are a specific way in which those objectives stated in the
Settlement Agreement can be met.
In addition, Section 2.10.5.6 of the Settlement Agreement provides for an
assessment of the Meter Add-On Pilot Program prior to its completion.  That
assessment will miss a prime opportunity to evaluate how well customers are
able to make use of real time data, and how the program should be modified
to enable them to make better use of the data, if they are not allowed to
actually use it during the Pilot.  One of the most significant assessments
will be how well customers use the data during critical periods, such as
OFO/EFOs.  Thus, the assessment element  in  Section 2.10.5.6 of the
Settlement Agreement also contemplates develop and use of real time data
from Add-On devices in the manner PowerSpring proposes.
PowerSpring, requests PG&E to reconsider its response in # 31 of the
Resolution Matrix.
