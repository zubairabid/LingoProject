We have the following items that are contained in several key directories/servers that we are assuming will be moved.  If this needs moving or changes prior to the sale then we will require a team from networks that can work with each of us to properly document and transfer these items to a clean environment.  I will follow up tomorrow with you to ensure we have met your needs.
