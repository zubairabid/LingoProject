I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions,
that they will certainly be called at trial.  Also, their testimony is
consistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand
the implications of the ruling on these facilities.
Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially
certify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity
is unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev
Proc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that
the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn't
mean increase it from 105 to 115 tons per hour. Also, Coston is going to have
to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I
don't think he's going to lie under oath (maybe I'm naive).
Regardless of the preceding comments, it sounds like we probably need to
talk to Tim W. about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K-M
folks (through their lawyer) about this before the next round of depos.
On a related note, I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several
issues.  First, I told him that if they were interested, we were interested
in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward.  I
questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the
equipment.  He said that this would be up to Mr. Holmes but that he strongly
doubted that "repricing the deal" or "dramatically changing the economics" of
the deal would be acceptable.  I also asked whether he thought a mediation
would be acceptable.  In response, he indicated that although he wouldn't
rule it out, he thought it was premature. Finally, I mentioned that there had
been some talk of deposing him.  He said that his only involvement in the
negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra
and, therefore, these communications would be privileged.  He said he only
met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in August and this
was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing
other things. He also said that he had no involvement with the IRS PLR's. Let
me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this.
Finally, George is still out of town but as soon as he returns, I'll get
with him to get out the letter I know that Greg is anxious that we send out.
Thanks.
