Hello Everyone,
Well, I looked around again for another inexpensive  ski trip for us to take this year.  The path has seemed to lead the same  direction as it did last year.  Lake Tahoe is by far the cheapest  package deal I can find.  I have already spoken to most of you who went  last year and everyone seems to agree it was a good time and great  atmosphere.  The dates for this adventure are leaving the evening of  January 30th (Wed.) and returning on Febuary 3rd (Sun.).
The vacation package is through Southwest Airlines  Vacations.
We will stay at the Horizon Casino for 4  nights.
We will depart:
Houston Hobby Airport @ 4:50 pm with a short stop  in Las Vegas and arrive into Reno at 9:20 pm.  We will then go by Charter  bus to Lake Tahoe.
Leaving Lake Tahoe:
Our plane will depart Reno at 12:10 pm on direct  route to Houston arriving at 6:50 pm.
And you ask how much for all this  excitement?
This can be all yours for 359.75 per person.   This price is for two people per room.  I will need to know who would like  to go no later than Wednesday  afternoon so I can set up reservations.  These  trips are booking fast.  We will be able to do like last year.  I will  call in the reservations and then each individual person will be able to call  Southwest directly and bill the trip to their own credit card.  The only  other expenses to be prepaid are for ski lift tickets and roundtrip transfer  from the airport to the hotel and back.  This cost is $30.  I figure  we will discuss the lift ticket options.  Some people may want to  Snowmobile a day or do something else.  We will discuss these options  further after the trip is set.
Hope to see everyone there.  The snow is  looking good up there so far.  They had 24" on the mountain  yesterday.
Mason is going.  I just don't have his e-mail  address but he said to count him in.
