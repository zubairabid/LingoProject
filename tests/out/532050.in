Unless someone has a different view, I think that we're all on the same page
and ready to go.  In that regard, you should have received via fax of the
language that Sher has put together.  I propose the following.  Please chime
in with suggestions, alternatives, etc.
Everyone review the language quickly and provide comments.
Simultaneously have Mike Day very quickly draft language (this morning)
capturing the ideas we've discussed (to make it happen, I think we need to
provide the specific language).
I will write a note now to the group that's been negotiating the core/noncore
deal, explaining what we think ought to be included and informing them we'll
provide legislative language shortly .
Assuming that most in the group buy-in to our proposal, we have
Hedy/Bev/Scott work with their lobbyists to get it inserted in the language.
Thoughts?
