Report: Power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion
DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
Thursday, March 22, 2001
,2001 Associated Press
(03-22) 11:41 PST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Electricity wholesalers have
overcharged California more than $5 billion since May by manipulating the
energy market, according to a report prepared for power grid managers.
The Independent System Operator will file the findings with federal
regulators and ask for a refund, ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said.
The state auditor also said Thursday that the state's 1996 deregulation law
encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to ``manipulate wholesale
prices to their advantage'' by underestimating supply and demand.
The auditor's report lays out what it calls ``a complex combination'' of
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.
According to the ISO report, five in-state power suppliers and 16 importers
frequently offered electricity at prices higher than it cost them to produce
-- effectively withholding supplies -- or didn't bid at all when they were
able to generate power.
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at a
conference in Berkeley last week.
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were
justified.
The commission has recently stepped up scrutiny of power companies' behavior
during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124 million in
sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money. Critics
claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged.
California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since
January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by
electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless.
Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring
wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from
recovering the costs from customers.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's
power-buying is gutting its budget surplus.
Since the state started making emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen
from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said.
Connell ordered an audit of the power buys, saying Gov. Gray Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund''
she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10
billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to
demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the administration has released the
financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term
power contracts with wholesalers.
Also Wednesday, a federal judge ordered a major wholesaler, Reliant Energy
Services, to continue selling power to California despite its fear that it
will not be paid.
The ISO buys power from companies like Reliant on behalf of utilities in
attempts to fend off rolling blackouts like those that hit the state this
week and during two days in January.

Reliant To Appeal Fed Judge Ruling To Sell Pwr To Calif

03/22/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) said Thursday it will
immediately file with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in
response to a federal judge's ruling late Wednesday that the company continue
selling power to California regardless of whether it is paid.
U.S. District Court Judge Frank Damrell granted California's Independent
System Operator, which makes last minute power purchases in the spot market,
a preliminary injunction against Reliant, saying Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the state.
The ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, said the judge's ruling
will allow the agency to keep the lights on in California.
Reliant, which is owed more than $300 million from the state's cash-strapped
utilities, supplies California with about 3,000 megawatts of electricity from
power plants it owns in the state.
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said the state Department of Water
Resources, the agency that buys California's bulk power needs on behalf of
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit
Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas &
Electric, should back the ISO's last minute power purchases.
In a filing with the Securities and Commission, Reliant said it is owed $108
million by the DWR for last minute power purchases the ISO made during the
six weeks prior to the agreement Reliant made with the DWR.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's claim, saying he does not have the authority to
force the DWR to pay for that power.
"We're going to immediately appeal Judge Damrell's order," Wheatley said.
"Clearly the judge understands the implications of his order. We are required
to do business with creditworthy entities. Unfortuantely the judge did not
force the ISO to post a surety bond, which would allowed us to do business
with the ISO."
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state is not responsible for the last minute
power purchases the ISO makes, despite a law passed authorizing the DWR to
buy power on behalf of the utilities.
Wheatley added that the company will also seek relief on the issue at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Damrell's ruling remains in effect
until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
Separately, Wheatley said a short-term power supply contract that Reliant
signed with the DWR expired Monday and the DWR has not renewed the contract.
A spokesman for the DWR would not comment on the issue.

Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California

Updated: March 21, 2001 - 8:23 p.m.
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major
electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear
that it will not get paid.
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO
buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try
to fend off blackouts.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.
The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by
suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the
costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said.
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three
other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling
to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.
Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office
Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press
seeking comment on the ruling.
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring
the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order,
requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue
sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling.
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out,
enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for
roughly 750 homes.
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant
said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most
of the power is committed under long-term contracts.
Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it
won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison.
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June
due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996
deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers.
At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part
to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight
hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest.
Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state
Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed
the state to avoid blackouts.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also
imperils California's financial health.
Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is
gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power
buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2
billion, she said.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its
power-buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.
"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand
that kind of audit information," Harrison said.
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the
$10 billion in long-term debt.
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity
purchases.
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money."
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering
challenging Davis next year.
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with
wholesalers.
Also Wednesday, a report by Davis' chief power negotiator appears to show
that as much as 75 percent of the state's power purchases will have to be on
the expensive short-term market this summer, said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina
del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee.
"The prices may be phenomenol," she said, particularly given predicted
hydroelectric shortages due to drought in the Pacific Northwest.
The report by David Freeman, who is negotiating the state's long-term power
contracts, shows California has finalized 19 contracts and has 25 agreements
in principle. Freeman said DWR is continuing to negotiate other contracts.
Bowen said FERC should impose short-term price caps or let generators to
charge enough to make a reasonable profit "or we could be subject to enormous
price-gouging this summer."

State falling short on pacts that provide low-cost energy
Published Thursday, March 22, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News
BY CHRIS O'BRIEN AND JOHN WOOLFOLK

Mercury News

The state has signed low-cost contracts for just a third of the energy it
needs this year, raising the prospect that California could be forced to buy
much of its electricity this summer on the expensive spot market.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis conceded Wednesday that the state will be in
trouble without more contracts, but insisted California will meet its needs
through conservation and additional long-term deals for cheap electricity.
The state, according to a report released Wednesday, has fallen far short of
the governor's goal of filling almost all its electricity needs through such
deals. In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount
Davis had projected earlier this month.
If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price
of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price,
pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay.
But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said
he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the
plan.''
In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water
Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million
megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million
megawatt-hours needed.
``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in
three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a
lot more to do.''
The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the
state's nearly bankrupt utilities.
The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power
at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68
per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in
December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low
as the $55 Davis hoped to reach.
Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to
2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under
contract. Until then, the amount falls short.
In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The
gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003.
At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would
have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the
open market.
At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a
rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David
Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available
electricity has already been sold.
``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford
professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator,
the agency that runs the state power grid.
Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this
summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've
resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power.

Crisis saps state surplus
POWER CRISIS
Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion
surplus has been cut more than half since January
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER
The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more
than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a
top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases
and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account.
A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5
billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion,
according to Controller Kathleen Connell.
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus," Connell said in a
statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration
officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. "The energy
crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the
electricity purchases would put the fund at risk."
Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the
governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing
long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys.
According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from
the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be
forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly
expensive spot market and further drain its coffers.
And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that
would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides
what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state
treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay
taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric
utilities.
The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the
utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week
contributed to blackouts.
Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of
money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state
officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that
will be repaid by electricity consumers.
The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on
since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from
the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a
day.
High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy,
and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell.
In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the
transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration
to send her office more information about the electricity purchases.
Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the
funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused
her of making political hay.
"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want
to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like
this," said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. "We're sorry
it came up in this manner."
Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The
controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her
Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of
the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power
generators and traders to sell at higher prices.
Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority
either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state
water resources department.
Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid
is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the
blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if
the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers.
Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants,
wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to
spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and
Tuesday.
Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as
qualifying facilities, "immoral." The QFs were either unable to buy gas from
their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them.
"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any
money out," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "They've got the money --
we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it."
The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough
cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion.
Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to
heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of
ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys.
PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water
resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected
from ratepayers for power purchases.
The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among
QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric
plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the
spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson.
"There isn't enough to do that," he said.
That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked,
according to a growing chorus of officials and experts.
Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack
of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others
will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said.
"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money
is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?" Nelson
said. "What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state."
Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the
utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets,
Maviglio said.
"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going
there," he said.
WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM
About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three
major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third
comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques
and one-third is bought on the open market.
The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after
the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the
purchases themselves.
But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has
planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases.
Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15
but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven
suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.

Bill to pay small energy firms stalls
By Kevin Yamamura, Dale Kasler and Jim Sanders
Bee Staff Writers
(Published March 23, 2001)
A quickly melded proposal that would assure payments for alternative energy
suppliers whose money woes contributed to power blackouts this week stalled
Thursday in a divided Legislature.
The state Senate passed the bill, AB 8x, but with Republicans balking, it was
rejected in the Assembly along party lines. Assembly leaders said they may
try again today.
For most of Thursday, lawmakers scrutinized legislation they had overhauled
the night before to include Gov. Gray Davis' plan to force utilities to pay
solar, wind and small gas-fired suppliers. Such providers, called "qualified
facilities," or QFs, provide more than 20 percent of California's
electricity, and their shutdowns were partly to blame for rolling blackouts
Monday and Tuesday.
Under the Democratic governor's plan, the state Public Utilities Commission
would determine prices at which alternative generators may sell power, but
legislation is needed to authorize the PUC action.
Lawmakers faced time pressures Thursday. They wanted to pass the bill quickly
so the PUC could act next week and legislators could embark Monday on an
annual three-day lobbying trip in Washington, D.C.
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said the Republicans'
rejection of AB 8x could jeopardize more than $4 billion the state has spent
or allocated for electricity during the energy crisis.
Hertzberg said producers of alternative energy, which are owed more than $1
billion, have threatened to drag debt-ridden utilities into involuntary
bankruptcy if the Legislature failed to pass the measure.
"They said it, and I believe it," Hertzberg said. If such bankruptcies occur,
he added, the state with its multibillion-dollar debt would become "just
another creditor in a pile of creditors."
But Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park said the
finger-pointing is unfair. Passage of AB 8x would not necessarily prevent
bankruptcies, he said.
One alternative energy provider won a crucial court ruling Thursday that
staved off, at least for a while, threats by some creditors to haul one or
both big utilities into bankruptcy court for nonpayment of bills.
CalEnergy Co. Inc. won the right to sell its geothermal power, which was
contracted to Southern California Edison, on the open market. CalEnergy said
it is owed $45 million by Edison.
If the Imperial County judge hadn't ruled in CalEnergy's favor, the company
and seven other QFs "were fully prepared" to file an involuntary bankruptcy
petition against Edison this morning, said David Sokol, chief executive of
CalEnergy's parent, MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. of Des Moines, Iowa.
"That is currently off the table."
An involuntary bankruptcy proceeding would take California's energy crisis
into uncharted territory, although a bankruptcy judge would have the leeway
to reject the filing.
Freed from its contract with Edison, CalEnergy will move to sell its
electricity "to people who will pay for it," Sokol said.
Besides calming the bankruptcy movement temporarily, the ruling also could
prompt other alternative energy providers -- hundreds of which have shut down
because of nonpayment by Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to follow
CalEnergy's example and find other buyers for their electricity, said Gary
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators.
Assembly Republicans said they felt the Senate's decision to package three
important energy issues into a single bill was an attempt to ramrod
legislation through both houses.
"We have to stand and say no," Campbell said during floor debate.
Besides determining alternative generator payments, the bill would change an
earlier law by capping the value of bonds the state may sell for power
purchases at $10 billion. It also would extend to large businesses an
existing rate cap in the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. service area.
And it would earmark a portion of rates paid by utility customers to fund the
state's ongoing power purchases. Within a week, the state will have spent
$4.2 billion on power since January.
Without the bill, some legislators fear, Pacific Gas and Electric and
Southern California Edison would be reimbursed before the state.
"They have got (some) gall to go to the PUC and say they're going to go to
court to keep our money -- to keep our money to pay off their creditors,"
said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.
Most of the bill's controversy, however, centered on how the PUC would treat
gas-fired alternative generators.
The commission issued a revised draft decision Wednesday that would impose
prices for qualifying facilities at $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year
contracts or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years.
But those producers that use natural gas -- representing about two-thirds of
the alternative energy providers in California -- spent Thursday arguing that
Davis' plan to rescue them would all but guarantee that they would go out of
business instead.
The plan -- ordering Edison and PG&E to pay them a fixed price for their
power -- would set rates well below the cost of natural gas, they said.
Democratic lawmakers tried to assure such producers that the PUC would set
prices that make business sense, even obtaining a letter to that effect from
Loretta Lynch, who heads the commission.
Davis has vowed to fine Edison and PG&E if they don't pay alternative
producers for future deliveries. But Sokol said his company isn't convinced
that Edison will pay.
Calling Edison a "confrontive, in-your-face, nasty organization," Sokol said
the utility was "sitting on $2 billion" and not paying its bills. Edison, in
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday, said its debts outweigh
its cash reserves by $722 million.
The Senate sent the Assembly two other bills that deal specifically with
supply and demand. The first, SB 5x, would spend about $1 billion on energy
conservation and low-income assistance programs. The other, SB 28x, would
streamline siting procedures for power plant construction.
In separate energy-related matters Thursday, the Assembly approved:
AB 21x, which would allow businesses, industries or other electrical
customers to negotiate private contracts with energy providers.
Nine energy bills designed to generate or save 665 megawatts of electricity
-- including 345 megawatts this summer. One megawatt is enough electricity to
light about 1,000 homes.
The state put power emergencies behind it, after dropping out of a Stage 1
alert late Wednesday. The California Independent System Operator, which
manages the state's power transmission grid, was predicting no further alerts
this week. It expected cooling temperatures and a regular dropoff in
electricity use on Fridays to lessen demand, at the same time that more power
plants were returning to service.

House panel ends energy hearings -- will it step in?
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published March 23, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- A key House panel wrapped up a series of hearings on the
California electricity crisis Thursday and now will decide whether to come to
the state's aid with legislation.
But the panel's Texas chairman made clear that West Coast price controls
won't be on the table.
"Caps will not be in anything I am submitting," said Rep. Joe Barton,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality
subcommittee.
Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this
summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of
witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings
over five days.
Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and
Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like
New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging.
But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for
enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused
to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by
opposing any legislation that would compel such action.
Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative
remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation.
He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and
after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and
Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order.
"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer,
we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks," Barton said.
Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a
"careful and deliberate approach" to the California crisis, which he said was
largely of the state's own making.
There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as
more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality
standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate
through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by
about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes.
But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power
production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality.
"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to
air emission limitations," he said. "California's programs to protect public
health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to
date."
The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale
prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California
and the West Coast.
William L. Massey, the lone member of the energy regulatory commission who
supports price controls, said at a Tuesday hearing that without them the West
Coast faces economic catastrophe this summer.
It was evident from the comments of some Republicans that they think their
party could capitalize politically from a difficult summer.
"If they had a bad summer, it could show up in the polls," said Rep. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga. "And sometimes that's not a bad idea."
One of the most dramatic exchanges during the weeklong hearings came Thursday
with S. David Freeman, the former general manager of the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District who now heads the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
He recently was named Gov. Gray Davis' chief negotiator with power generators
for long-term contracts to stabilize future deliveries.
"Don't feel sorry for California," Freeman said. "We're going to come out of
this stronger than ever."
But Freeman said it will be a year or two before all the fixes are in place,
and in the meantime the region desperately needs Congress' help to force the
FERC into controlling wholesale prices, which witnesses said are likely to
rise from $7 billion last year to as much as $70 billion or more this year.
"We recognize that the current administration and various legislators have
their own opinion as to the California situation," Freeman said. "But my
personal plea is that if the federal government is not going to help us, the
least it should do is refrain from legislation that attempts to tell us what
to do."
Barton perked up at that idea.
"Leave California alone, huh?" Barton said. "That might be a good motto."

Dan Walters: Crisis deepens: politicos panic


(Published March 23, 2001)
That choking sound you hear is California's political class shifting into
near-panic mode as it realizes that the energy crisis is on the verge of
becoming a full-scale meltdown, with utilities forced into bankruptcy and
consumers hammered by severe and prolonged power blackouts and soaring
electricity bills.
The Legislature, which had been content to allow Gov. Gray Davis to handle
the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's
unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities
into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation
aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting
conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and
electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and
other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a
political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes.
While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility
deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming
Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and
even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the
governor.
"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and
a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient,"
Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private
negotiations and public posturing.
A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a
warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had
already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she
refused to authorize additional transfers. It was a direct shot by Connell at
Davis, an old rival, and came just a day after the governor had endorsed a
Connell foe, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the duel for mayor of Los Angeles.
Other Democrats didn't join Connell's direct challenge to Davis, but there
is, nevertheless, a growing concern among Democratic legislators that the
power purchases are costing many billions of dollars more than the governor
had projected and could place the state budget in jeopardy. They're nervous
because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much
power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying.
From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is
spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's
reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis
probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate
increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently
into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order
huge refunds from power suppliers.
Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the
costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared. Data from the
administration and utilities, when collated, indicate that the state is in
line to collect just 20 cents for every dollar it's spending on power
purchases, and the gap will increase as summer heat drives up demand.
Privately, some economists say that private utility rates will have to rise
33 percent to 50 percent to cover costs of current power supplies, plus
utilities' past debts to generators and the state's purchase of the
utilities' transmission system, if that deal is made final.
"It's ultimately going to break down, and the ratepayer is going to pay for
it one way or the other," Republican Sen. Jim Battin said during one of
Thursday's many committee hearings on utility legislation. No one disagreed
with him.

Report says power wholesalers overcharged state $6 billion



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Electricity wholesalers have overcharged California more than
$6.2 billion by manipulating the energy market, according to a report by an
economist working for power grid managers.
The Independent System Operator planned to file the findings with federal
regulators Thursday, and ask for a refund, said ISO spokesman Patrick
Dorinson.
In a related development, the state auditor said Thursday that the state's
1996 deregulation law encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to
"manipulate wholesale prices to their advantage" by underestimating both
supply and demand.

The auditor's report lays out what it calls "a complex combination" of
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.
The ISO's filing came a day after the state controller complained that a
relentless energy crisis is jeopardizing California's financial future.
Since May, the companies manipulated the market by bidding at excessive
prices, effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they
had generation capability available, according to the ISO study.
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at an
energy conference at the University of California, Berkeley, last week.
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were
justified.
In a burst of activity after weeks of delay, both houses of the Legislature
approved bills Thursday designed to ease the energy crisis.
The state Senate approved measures to encourage energy conservation and speed
up power plant construction.
Topping that, the Assembly sent the Senate 14 energy-related bills, including
$455 million in loans and grants to encourage energy efficiency and
conservation and alternative energy projects by this summer.
One of the Assembly bills would require new energy plants approved by the
state to sell their power within California before they offer it to other
states.
"The (California) Energy Commission says for every day we delay this bill
there are 20 megawatts that could be saved that we're not saving," said state
Sen. Byron Sher, D-Stanford, as senators voted 28-10 to send his conservation
measure to the Assembly.
Senators also approved another Sher bill speeding up the siting of power
plants. It went to the Assembly on a 37-1 vote.
Meanwhile, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering
one of the companies named in the ISO filing, Reliant Energy Services, to
continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid.
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys at
the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend
off blackouts.
Such blackouts struck the state twice this week, shutting off power to
hundreds of thousands of people from San Diego to Oregon, snarling traffic
and shutting down businesses.
The state remained free of any power alerts Thursday morning, as power
reserves stayed above 7 percent.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities,
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.
The utilities have been denied credit after amassing billions of dollars in
debt paying high prices for power that the state's energy deregulation law
prevents them from passing on to consumers.
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the
costly last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said.
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
In another development Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell
complained that the energy crunch is imperiling California's financial
health.
Connell said the state's power buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is gutting
its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power buys in
January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she
said.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power buying, saying Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She is also refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its power
buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Connell is a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles in next month's election.
The ISO study, meanwhile, covered five major in-state power suppliers )
Reliant, Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, as well as 16 power
importers. All deliver power to customers of Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., the state's three largest investor-owned utilities.
"All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts," said
ISO's Sheffrin.
According to the report, the overcharging took place beginning last May, when
the energy crisis began, and continued through last month.
During that time, according to the report, energy suppliers commonly offered
their electricity at twice the amount it cost them to produce.
FERC member William L. Massey said he wasn't shocked to hear the amount
overcharged added up to more than $5 billion.
"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said.
Chuck Griffin, spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant said the company would
justify their charges to FERC officials.
"I think we're missing sometimes just how basic the problem is in California.
Supply and demand are out of whack and some basic rules of economics kick in
when that happens," he said.

Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm



Controller puts hold on transfer of $5.6 billion to reserve funds
By Karen Kucher and Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS
March 22, 2001
The state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5
billion since January largely because California's power purchases are
devouring the money, state controller Kathleen Connell said yesterday.
Connell said she wants to see more documentation about state power spending
before approving the transfer of $5.6 billion from the general fund to a
special reserve fund requested by Gov. Gray Davis.
Connell said the state would have to borrow $2.4 billion to cover the
transfer.

"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has
taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity
purchases would put the (general) fund at risk," Connell said in a statement.
Her action came on a day when state power supplies improved. After two days
of forced outages this week, no rolling blackouts were ordered yesterday.
Several power plants came back on line and imports from the Pacific Northwest
provided enough electricity to meet demand yesterday, said Stephanie
McCorkle, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator,
which manages most of the state's power grid.
"Gradually more (electricity) generation comes on every day," McCorkle said.
"By Monday, we should see somewhere around 2,200 megawatts back in service
that was not on this Monday. That's if no other generation falls off."
Meanwhile, Connell's move took some by surprise.
A spokesman for the state Department of Finance said Connell is denying a
routine transfer that is required by law. "It was just a routine accounting
measure that we didn't anticipate becoming controversial," Sandy Harrison
said.
Connell announced the denial of the transfer a day after Davis endorsed one
of her opponents, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, in the race
for Los Angeles mayor.
Connell, who monitors California's cash flow, said she was "deeply concerned
about putting the state's general fund in a deficit situation in light of the
energy crisis."
About two months ago, the state began spending about $50 million a day to buy
power after Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison nearly
went bankrupt. It is also purchasing power for customers of San Diego Gas and
Electric.
The Davis administration said earlier this week it soon will begin spending
an additional $500 million on power purchases, bringing the total to $4.2
billion.
As that staggering sum continues to grow, the state won a court battle with
an electricity supplier yesterday. A federal judge in Sacramento sided with
the state and ordered the wholesaler to continue selling to California
despite its fear that it will not get paid.
Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm
if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the Independent System
Operator. The ISO acquires last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill
gaps in supply to try to fend off blackouts.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for the power.
Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly
last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing
state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
Meanwhile, those who manage the power grid say the forecast for power
supplies this week looks good, although conditions can change quickly.
ISO managers continue to stress the importance of conservation. Utility
customers across the state conserved about 900 megawatts of power Tuesday,
which kept blackouts from being ordered that night.
As the power crisis worsened this week, ISO managers wished aloud that they
still could rely on business customers to shut down in exchange for lower
energy rates.
Such "interruptible" customers saved as much as 2,100 megawatts last spring,
a figure that dropped to about 1,700 last summer and 1,400 at the end of the
year. But in January, the state Public Utilities Commission told utilities
they could no longer impose fines on business customers who refuse to shut
down when asked.
ISO managers realize the program was harming businesses with frequent
interruptions of service -- but they still miss having that option, McCorkle
said.
"It would have made an enormous difference, but at the same time we
understand the impact it was having on businesses," McCorkle said.

Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say



By Dean Calbreath
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
March 22, 2001
Until this week, the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce was predicting
that the county was well-insulated from the growing threat of economic
recession.
But that was before the lights went out in the chamber's downtown
headquarters Monday.
Working by window light in his darkened office, chamber economist Kelly
Cunningham rapidly erased his previous projections for 3.5 percent growth for
San Diego County. Cunningham now feels the local economy could fall into a
recession thanks to its shaky supply of energy.

"Blackouts are very disruptive to the economy," Cunningham said. "A business
can absorb rising energy prices by cutting costs or raising its own prices.
But an energy shutoff is much less predictable. It cuts into productivity."
Those sentiments are being echoed throughout California, as business leaders
and economists worry that rolling blackouts will darken the state's
previously glowing economy.
At the University of California Los Angeles, for instance, leading financial
theorists will meet April 4 to discuss the question "Can California grow in
the dark?" Although the topic was chosen before the recent string of power
outages, the blackouts have given the issue new urgency.
"These blackouts are not just a single episode," said UCLA economist Tom
Lieser. "They are a bridge to what will happen this summer. If we don't fall
into a recession in the second half of the year, we will fall pretty close."
Tapan Munroe, an economist formerly with Pacific Gas and Electric, this week
crossed out his projection for 2 percent statewide growth. After blackouts
rolled toward his consulting offices in the Bay Area city of Moraga, Munroe
decided the state will be lucky if it manages zero growth.
"I'm a pretty optimistic guy by nature, but this has been sobering," Munroe
said. "On Tuesday, one restaurant alone in San Francisco lost $20,000.
Multiply that by all of the businesses that lost power in the state and
you've got a serious problem."
Two days of blackouts in San Diego County have hurt businesses large and
small. Among the industries under threat is the local biotechnology sector,
which requires a steady supply of electricity to power areas of laboratories
that must remain temperature-controlled and sterile.
Continued blackouts "could have a huge impact, not only in dollars, but
multiple millions of dollars," said Tom Oster, vice president of operations
for BioCom, the leading trade organization for the more than 200 biotechs in
San Diego County.
Idun Pharmaceuticals, a biotech near La Jolla Village Drive that has 67
employees, had its power cut for about 40 minutes Tuesday. Though the company
has a back-up generator, some segments of its laboratories and lab equipment
were not supported by it. Chemists also had to turn off some sensitive lab
equipment to avoid the possibility of a damaging power surge once the
blackout was over.
"We're not in a position as a small company to back up the whole facility,"
said Steven Mento, Idun's chief executive. "We haven't done a survey yet to
determine whether we had losses, either in experiments or equipment damaged
-- but we're hoping because the blackout was so short that damage will be
minimal."
Mento said rolling blackouts, coupled with continuing high energy costs,
could cripple many small biotechs -- and even take a bite out of bigger, more
established companies.
"We generate new compounds in controlled environments on a daily basis, and
when power goes off you can lose samples because of contamination and other
issues," Mento said. "We are fortunate that our losses would be in having to
repeat an experiment -- but this could be really critical for companies with
drug manufacturing and issues of quality control."
The wireless firms along Sorrento Valley have not been immune from blackouts.
The lights went out at Qualcomm early this week, although executives declined
to comment about the impact.
No blackouts hit the big shipbuilding operations on the waterfront this week.
But the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. -- one of San Diego's largest
employers -- already experienced a voluntary loss of power this year, its
first since World War II. Since the shipyard does not have its own power
supply, NASSCO executives fear the effect of unplanned outages.
"Our average payroll totals half a million dollars a day," said NASSCO
spokesman Jim Scott. "When you have a day's work disrupted, that can be
pretty serious. We're currently in discussions about the possibility of
buying from independent power suppliers, or setting up a power plant of our
own."
Small businesses, which constitute the bulk of employment in San Diego
County, were hurt by disruptions as well -- costing them vital revenue at a
time when their power bills have skyrocketed.
At Fantastic Sam's, a hair salon in Chula Vista, Angelica Alcala estimated
that business dropped 60 percent when the blackouts hit Tuesday. Among other
things, Alcala had to alter her planned haircuts because she was relying on
scissors instead of electric clippers.
At the Family Fun Center in El Cajon, the management gave vouchers or refunds
to the 15 or so video-game players who were in the midst of killing aliens or
fighting ninja warriors as the power went down.
Papa John's Pizza estimates that it may have lost several thousand dollars in
business after six stores were blacked out Monday and four others lost power
Tuesday. Brian Mills, who runs 23 Papa John's stores in the county, said his
main concern was shutting down the computers so they would not be damaged by
a power surge when the electricity was restored.
Paul Ecke III, a member of the West Coast advisory panel for the Federal
Reserve, said the potential impact of the energy crisis "is worse than any
downturn in the stock market."
Ecke, who runs the Paul Ecke Ranch flower operation in Encinitas, said the
crisis could be particularly harmful for the state's agricultural sector,
since farmers need electricity to pump water and natural gas to heat
greenhouses.
"What I'm really worried about is the energy thing is going to cast a shadow
on California," he said. "If you're a business person thinking about moving
to California right now, you're probably not going to do it because you're
not sure you're going to have your lights on this summer."
Besides the disruption to businesses, the energy crisis is also hurting the
pocketbooks of hourly workers who have been sent home during the crisis.
Under state law, employers are free to send hourly workers home without pay
during such emergencies, although salaried workers must still be paid.
Susan Kemp, an attorney with the California Chamber of Commerce, said there
are ways of minimizing the impact on hourly workers.
"You have to look at what time it is when the blackout occurs and how long
you think it's going to last," Kemp said. "If it's around a meal time, you
might send the workers out for a longer meal period if you think it's going
to be an hour or hour and a half delay."
But the potential for losing wages doesn't sit well with the hourly workers.
"When you get sent home early and lose your wages, you have even less money
to pay your inflated energy bills," said an hourly worker who was sent home
during Monday's blackout.

Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority



By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 22, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) At least three major out-of-state electricity generators are
challenging the authority of the California Public Utilities Commission to
investigate whether they deliberately reduced power supplies to drive up
prices.
The PUC has asked for power plant maintenance records as it tries to
determine whether Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and other
wholesalers have manipulated the energy market at California's expense.
At issue is who ultimately controls oversight of in-state plants that provide
most of California's electricity. The plants, once owned by the state's
largest utilities, were sold off as part of the state's 1996 attempt at
deregulation.

PUC President Loretta Lynch said the public deserves to know whether
generators have unnecessarily taken plants off-line to create artificial
shortages, forcing the utilities and now state bureaucrats to buy much higher
priced power on the spot energy market.
"What I do know is we have historically high levels of outages across the
board," Lynch told The Associated Press. "Dynegy and Duke have been fighting
the PUC in the PUC's quest to obtain documents about these outages."
The PUC has the authority to regulate facilities within its borders, she
added. "It doesn't matter where the headquarters of the company is."
Duke, based in North Carolina, says it does matter ) and that since it and
other wholesalers aren't headquartered in California, the PUC can't require
it to turn over the maintenance records.
"We have not given them proprietary information because they do not regulate
us," said Duke's spokesman, Tom Williams.
Dynegy did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
The PUC also faces a new challenge in the legislature. A bill sponsored by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which would have granted the
PUC greater inspection authority over out-of-state generators, was amended
this month to grant the authority to Independent System Operator instead.
The ISO has managed the delivery of energy through most of the state's power
grid but historically has done little regulating and has had no policing
authority.
This board, created during the state's 1996 attempt at deregulation, was
redesigned in January. Now it has a five-member board appointed by Davis,
replacing a 26-member ISO board composed of utility executives, marketers,
power plant owners and others.
The latest version of Migden's bill requires wholesalers to report monthly to
the ISO about any plants that are off-line or working at reduced capacity,
and give
