Bob:   I am still wonderring why the external modems my group had were
removed.  It seems like I am always having to order modems and accessories
every time we move anyone.  Since we are getting ready to move again, maybe
we should get an inventory of everything each logistic's person has at their
workstation, and this is what should be moved.
