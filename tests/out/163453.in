It looks like SCE is proposing to increase frozen rate levels by 10% on
January 1, 2001.  SCE also recognizes TURN's proposal that the TCBA and TRA
should never have been artificially segregated, but criticizes it as a
short-term solution that puts utilities' at significant risk.  The major
problems I have with PG&E and SCE's attitude are:
They are trying to renegotiate the AB1890 compact after viewing history;
As TURN has pointed out, they are only focusing on their undercollections and
not overcollections;
They believe that they were able to extend the rate freeze at prices above
market when wholesale prices were low, yet end the rate freeze when prices in
the wholesale market are high resulting in an immediate rate increase.  Where
were the utilities' risk in CTC recovery?
There is no discussion how direct access will be impacted; however, we must
be careful that they are trying to move away from the current PX crediting
mechanism; and
They ignore how much CTCs they have recovered to date.
As you know, we believe the rate freeze under the current mechanism must be
maintained until the statutory date of December 31, 2001.  Although a
surcharge mechanism may be an appropriate solution, it should be implemented
after December 31, 2001 and managed in a way to avoid sticker shock.  If cash
flow is an issue for the utilities, who were getting large sums of cash
inflow prior to the wholesale price run-ups, then securitizing an accounts
receivable may be a good solution.  In short, AB1890 should be preserved
through 2001 per TURNs recommended ratemaking accounting treatment.  We
should be amenable to a solution that allows utilities to recoup some of the
undercollections past December 31, 2001, if necessary through securitazion.
However, perhaps the amount of recovery may need to be discounted to reflect
an appropriate sharing of risks between ratepayers and utility shareholders.
We probably do not want to be out in front on this issue, so we should
probably work through other parties such as TURN, CLECA, and CMA.
