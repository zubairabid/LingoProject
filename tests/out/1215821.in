request_text:  Please provide a short description of each line in the two
tables (lines 4-24) including (a) a comparison of the differences between the
two tables (either the reasons for any differences in amounts for a line
description that is the same in both tables, or the reason for any
differences in the logic of the calculations), and (b) a &crosswalk8 showing
how each line in each table corresponds to a variable or equation (or both)
in section f of the GRSPs beginning on p. 15 of Attachment A to this
testimony.



response_text:
The following two tables are excerpted out of WP-02-E-BPA-77, page 9, lines
4-26.


Table Illustrating JCG Method










Table Illustrating BPA Method













Before beginning the comparison of the two tables, it should be pointed out
that the tables calculate gross augmentation costs.  We left out the step
that calculates the net augmentation costs.  As a result, the &Total8 line
dollar amounts ($6M and $6.2M in the JCG table, and $6M and $6M in the BPA
table) should all be reduced by the amount of augmentation resale revenue.
However, since this modification will not affect the comparison requested in
the data request, let us continue as if the &Total8 line dollar amounts are
already net of the augmentation revenue. See the attachment to the data
response.



















Another item that may be confusing is the item labeled &Pre-purchase ) 0 day
rule8.  This is the incremental cost associated with purchases made between
the 120-day cut-off and the 0-day cut-off.

Also, a crosswalk of each table showing how it corresponds to a variable or
equation in section f is not possible since section f reflects the BPA
method, not the JCG method.  Perhaps an overview of BPA,s perspective on the
difference between the JCG method and the BPA method will be helpful.

JCG calculated the augmentation costs using two different cost pools, one
cost pool for the Slice product (using the 120 day rule), and a second cost
pool for all other products (using the 0 day rule).  The products then
collected a portion of the augmentation costs associated with a specific
rule.  When these two cost pools yield different net augmentation costs
(which they usually will unless all of the augmentation is purchased under
the 120-day rule), the JCG method doesn,t collect the actual amount of either
of those pools from Slice or non-Slice.  Rather it collects a proportion of
each of the cost pools.

In contrast to the JCG method, the BPA method distributes the costs using the
120-day rule proportionally between the Slice and non-Slice products, and
then assesses all the incremental cost from using the 0-day rule rather than
the 120-day rule to the non-Slice products.  In contrast to JCG method, this
assures that all the actual incremental net augmentation costs calculated by
replacing the &120-day8 rule with the &0-day8 rule are recovered  from
purchasers of non-Slice power products.  In addition, this also assures that
purchasers of the Slice product do not bear any nearer term market prices
fluctuations.

Now for a short description of each line in the two tables, and a comparison
of the differences.  The example assumes that we don,t actually purchase all
of our augmentation, that some of it is served from BPA,s secondary, or is
bought in the spot market.

&Pre-purchase ) 120 day rule8 is the total cost of augmentation purchases
made at least 120 days prior to the month of delivery.  This amount is $2M in
both tables in both columns.  This amount represents the sum of DIURNALACA
for the six-month period.  This would have represented DIURNALACA(S) in the
GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case.

&Pre-purchase ) 0 day rule8 is the additional cost of pre-purchases made less
than 120 days prior to the month of delivery.  This amount is $1M in both
tables in the non-Slice column.  The 0-day rule pre-purchases are not
applicable to the Slice product, thus the N/A in the Slice column in both
tables.  If &Pre-purchase ) 120 day rule8 and &Pre-purchase ) 0 day rule8
were summed the sum would represent DIURNALACA(NS) in the GRSPs proposed by
the customers.  Note that the Pre-purchase ) 0 day rule appears in a
different row in the BPA table since BPA has proposed that these incremental
cost enter the calculations at a different point.

Short position is the cost of the amount of AAMTA that is not pre-purchased.
This is the amount that is valued at PRICE in the GRSPs.  In the JCG, the
short position is different between the Slice and non-Slice columns.  This is
because the example has BPA purchasing some additional augmentation ($1M
worth) under the 0-day rule, and there is a corresponding reduction in the
value of BPA,s short position.  The change also reflects that the short
position is valued using different PRICEs for the 120 day rule and the 0 day
rule.  In the BPA example, Short position is $3M for both Slice and non-Slice
products, and the difference (-$0.8M) is found in the row &Short position 0
day rule8

&Buydown8 is the cost of all buydowns.  It is the same in both tables, for
both Slice and non-Slice products.  In the examples BPA spent $1M buying down
load.

&Total8 is the gross cost of augmentation.  As stated above, it should be
reduced by the augmentation resale revenue.  To continue on, let us assume
that &Total8 has been reduced by augmentation resale revenue, and represents
the net augmentation costs.  In the JCG  example, &Total8 is $6M for Slice
and $6.2M for non-Slice.  These would represent NACA(S) and NACA(NS) in the
GRSPs proposed by the JCG in their Direct Case..  In the BPA example, Total
is $6M for both Slice and non-Slice.  This represents NACA in the BPA GRSPs.

&Percent of CRACable revenue8 is the same in both tables.  The example shows
that the Slice revenue is 30% of the total CRACable revenue, and the
non-Slice revenue is 70% of the total CRACable revenue.

&LB CRAC Costs8 only appears in the BPA example.  It is the NACA distributed
between Slice and non-Slice products in proportion to actual revenue.

&Pre-purchase 0 day rule8 and &Short position 0 day rule8 are the changes in
the valuation of pre-purchases ($1M) and Short position (-$0.8M) between the
120 day rule and the 0 day rule.  The net difference of $0.2M is equivalent
to the difference that is seen in &Total8 in the JCG example (the difference
between $6M and $6.2M).  This difference is also equivalent to NACDIFF in the
BPA GRSPs.

&Total LB CRAC Cost(s)8 is the cost that the Slice and non-Slice groups true
up to.  In the JCG example, the Slice product trues up to 30% of $6M, or
$1.8M while the non-Slice products true up to 70% of $6.2M for a total from
both groups of $6.14M.  In BPA,s example, the Slice product pays 30% of $6M
or $1.8M (the same as in the JCG example) while the non-Slice products pay
70% of $6M plus the net difference between valuation of net augmentation
costs using the 120 day rule and valuation using the 0 day rule.  The
non-Slice amount is $4.2M plus $0.2M or $4.4M.
