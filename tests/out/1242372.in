Greetings "Cruise Group,"

Below is the information from the travel agent concerning our June
cruise.  The agent's names is Virginia Book (281-293-3666).  She is
copied on this email if you need to email her as well.

It looks like, depending on what room you wanted, the price is $50 -
200/person more than what Robyn originally told you.  Robyn feels bad,
but I told her that's "chump change" to all you Rockefellers.  However,
if you want to downgrade your room (to "peasant" class with all the
Browns) to compensate for that increase, please contact Virginia
directly.

You need to contact Virginia concerning your deposit and specific
identification name by Sunday, Feb 10 which really means Friday, Feb. 8.
Don't forget or delay.  We'd hate to lose some of you.  We've got a good
group together.  Because of our group size, we're going to get some
discounts (See below).  Anything we get as a lump-sum discount, Robyn
and I will ensure it gets spread across the entire group.

Scooter/Kenny - Please provide this information to the friends you've
invited.  Also, I'm not sure my email address for Rusty is good, so make
sure he knows.

Virginia - There is a group of us interested in playing golf at one of
the disports.  Can you find out for me the possibilities of getting
tee-times (3) for about 10 folks to play?  It looks like the most likely
spots are Grand Cayman or Mexico.  Obviously, I don't have a feel for
course availability or timing requirements.  I would look to you to tell
me where my best spot is to get off the boat, play a round of golf on an
adequate course, and get back on the boat before I get left.  Please let
me know what my golfing options are.  Thanks.
