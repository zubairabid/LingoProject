Hello all,

I know, I know... the updates have been few and far between. But
here it goes.

Its about 1:30 pm on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon.  I had a safe
trip to Ooty and back chaperoning the high school girls field
hockey trip. Ooty is another hill station about an 8 hour bus trip
from here. The students travel there about 3 times a semester to
compete in various sporting events. Its significantly bigger so there
are more schools (and more shopping opportunities) there to
compete with. We left Thursday afternoon and arrived Thursday
evening. On Friday, it was the outdoor field hockey competition
between 4 schools. The girls won 2nd place. On Saturday the girls
won first place in indoor hockey. Hebron, a British missionary
school, hosted the tournament. It was the first time I saw so many
people that looked like me. It was unbelievable how many blond
hair, blue-eyed people there were. Hebron was founded around the
same time Kodaikanal International School was (about 100 years
ago) and while KIS has transformed itself from a purely American
Christian school to an International School, Hebron has remained
virtually the same with regards to its Christian beginnings and to
the students enrolled. Its largely British, with Australians and New
Zealanders and very few Indian students. I had a great time getting
to know the girls and answering a lot of their questions about the
States for the 12th grade girls who have applied to colleges in the
US.

The trip was amazing, but also a bit depressing. Its so sad to travel
through. Some of the living conditions are unbelievably poor
especially in the plains. We are also so fortunate to be able to live
the way we do.  Anyways... I am also extremely busy substituting
a 9th grade English honors class. The teacher is out for 2 weeks
for a supposed spider bite and skin graph. I really wish I had paid
more attention in high school. The students are reading
Shakespeare and luckily its Romeo and Juliet. ITs about the only
Shakespeare story that anyone can fumble through. It was to
initially be a supervisory role when we thought he would be out 3
days but its now more a teaching role since hes out for 2 weeks.
Can't wait for him to return.

Gotta run. Want to try to take a nap before ultimate frisbee. Didn't
make it home until 3 am last night from Ooty. I will be sending
another email mid-March after long weekend. I am heading to the
southern state of Kerala with Priya and her family for a boating
backwaters trip through some Indian villages.

Hope all is well! Take care.

Love,
Lisa
