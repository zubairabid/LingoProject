EnronOnline/NetCoOnline status update:
- "NetCoOnline" will be distinct from EnronOnline, with much the same functionality and a refreshed look.
- We will carry data to support the same gas and power products as were on EnronOnline. Please contact us if you will need different products from what was on EnronOnline.
- We have prepared a list of top customers in CDN and US Gas and Power (copy attached), which we will be using as a guide in chasing signed Password Applications.
- To speed the registration process, top customers will be preloaded into the system for activation as soon as we receive their Password Application.
- We are intending to use a simple, online GTC, which can be superceded by a negotiated Master Agreement, as with EnronOnline.
- Internal trader names have been circulated to each desk head for approval.
