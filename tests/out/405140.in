I read this article that said
typical symptoms of stress
are eating too much, smoking
too much, impulse buying and

she doesn't give a shit.





They keep telling us to get in
touch with our bodies. Mine
isn't all that communicative
but I heard from it the other

toning?" Clear as a bell my
body said, "listen bitch...do
it and you die."
