Many of you have received an Enron check for MetLife coverage.  Below is the explanation for this payment.

_________________________________

The check was from a company called ULR who Enron hired to disburse the monies we received from MetLife resulting from their demutualization - after their IPO stock offering, they became publicly traded instead of being a mutual insurance company.  Because of Enron's past association with MetLife, we received a cash distribution and that's what we gave eligible employees.

Employees who were active as of 9-28-99 and on the payroll 9-28-01 received a share of the distribution.  If you fall within that criteria and you did not receive a check please call ULR at 866-286-1434 to inquire.
