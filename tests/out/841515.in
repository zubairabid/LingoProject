We have reviewed the exception reports and no one entered the headcount for
their cost center in the survey.  Please go into the second button named
"Please Enter Number of People for Each Position" and enter your headcount by
position.  This information gets rolled over each month except when we begin
a new quarter and we require that you enter your FTEs into a blank database.
