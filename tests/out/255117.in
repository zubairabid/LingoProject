Here is the initial feedback from the Montana lawyers.  Looks like Lloyds is
more interested settling with EOTT as part of a global buy out of all old
InterNorth policies. I wouldn't place any stock whatsoever in the comment
Lloyds' representative made about Studdert.  He has been very helpful and
highly professional in all matters pertaining to this case.  EOTT and Enron
might be able to negotiate some sort of settlement as part of a global buy
out, but I don't know if Enron would even consider this.  Studdert might have
the best feel for this.  Separately, the defendant group will get back to us
on any offer they might be willing to make to settle just the Montana case,
but it appears that their real interest would be in a "global" deal.  Any
comments?  SWD
