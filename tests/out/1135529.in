To Haas E-Mail account holders:

Users of Haas E-Mail services may now check email using their
Windows NT/2000 passwords. Now you need to remember one less password, and
can use a simple method for password changing.  (See
http://groups.haas.berkeley.edu/HCS/howdoi/chntpsswd.htm )

You may immediately use your NT password to check your E-Mail
using Eudora or other POP and IMAP mail clients.  No software changes are
required.

As always,  should you experience any problems with this new
service, please contact the information desk in the Computer Center, or
Helpdesk at http://helpdesk.haas.berkeley.edu, phone 510/642-0434.
