I am not sure if it is premature and there is an obvious business interest on their part, but Blakes has called a number of times to see if they can be involved in any Canadian matters involving the merger process and approvals.  In fairness, Blakes is the firm that understands and represents our Canadian business the best, and a number of regulatory approvals may be required.  They apparently have cleared all conflicts.
