Dear Ken,

I wanted to let you know that we've extended an invitation to speak at the Management Conference to your friend Irwin Stelzer.  In a meeting with Greg Whalley and Steve Kean a few weeks ago, we'd discussed the idea of having an economist speak at the management conference in light of recent world events and their impact on the national economy.  After running the names of several respected economists by Mr. Stelzer and reviewing their tapes, Steve Kean and I opted to invite Mr. Stelzer.  (He promised he is better than any of the others we were considering and he won't charge us.)

I sent a note inviting Mr. Stelzer on Friday afternoon.  This is his very prompt response.  (I have to say, your exceptional reputation and valued friendships make my job easy.)

I'll be in contact with Mr. Stelzer today to work through logistics.
