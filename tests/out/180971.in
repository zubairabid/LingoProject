We are attempting to follow up on the Bowen comment about the CPUC.  In
contrast to Bowen's statememnt, 3PUC commissioners indicated today during
discussions on related matters at their normal business meeting that they
supported direct access and one commissioner--Brown--indicated that he hoped
the Bowen bill passed.  We are unaware of any special meeting to address
direct access next week.  We will provide more information as we obtain it.
