Please see attached a brief overview of the current legal framework for the
control of NOx emissions in the EU as well as changes under preparation.
Please note that the two EU directives which govern the current regime of NOx
emmissions abatement plan on the pan-European level only set the minimum
requirements. Nothing precludes Member States setting tighter limits on
emissions when implementing these Directives into their national legislation.
