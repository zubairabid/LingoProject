The "trade" with the parents and associated companies is really an allocation of premium as opposed to a purchase from the parent.  There was a separate insurance program purchased to cover all the Azurix assets and the premium was allocated to the participants.  Wessex received a portion of the premium through the allocation.  Due to our extensive regulated pipeline system, we are familiar with the issues related to the regulatory scrutiny of allocated premiums.  The pipelines include allocated premiums in their "rate case" and historically, we have been successful in supporting the amounts charged.

On what are you basing your statement that the Azurix allocation to Wessex is not competitive?  Have you priced coverage in the market?  I would be very interested in the information that you have received as our only data points would be your premium levels when we acquired Wessex.  As you will recall,  Enron left your program in place initially.  Azurix placed their own program in December of 1999, and your program was terminated at that time. (This is only the second year of the Azurix program.)  The market has "hardened" considerably over the past two years.

Once the North America assets are sold, the "Azurix" program will be remarketed (Dec., 2001) for the four (4) remaining water companies and a small U.S. exposure, if any remains.  This would be a portfolio of assets with similar operations and I would not anticipate  Wessex supporting the rest of the Azurix program.  We could also consider providing coverage under the Enron program, if it fits.

If you have not gone to the market, how would you propose doing so in order to secure stand alone pricing?  What brokers and markets would you plan to use?  Do you plan to return to using a captive for certain coverages?

Please advise.
