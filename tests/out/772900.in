Laura,
Based on the response received from Sue and TK (below), please remind PNM of the 10,000 Dth PNR balance and ask them to nominate the gas off TW at their earliest convenience. The gas is currently "parked" at the Rio Puerco PNR point, POI# 500617. Since the Purchase Order# 27190 expired on 4/30/2000, PNM will have to use their current PNR contract (Cr# 27267).  I have asked Richard Hanagriff to transfer the quantities from PO# 27190 to Cr# 27267.
In your discussions with PNM you might verify that Imbalance Statements should continue to be sent to Sally Prentice at Alvarado Square in Albuquerque, NM. (TW has been sending an imbalance statement on this 10,000 Dth to Sally each month)
If you have any questions, please call me.
