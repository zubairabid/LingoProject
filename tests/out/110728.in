Every year, a holiday gift is sent from the Executive Committee and is
normally a donation to a charity of Enron's choice.  This year, we have tried
a different approach. Elyse Kalmans and Kathy Mayfield from Community
Relations recommended an on-line service called Chairtygift.com.  Each
recipient can select the charity of their choice from many hundreds in the
United States.  Should they choose to not go on-line and select a charity,
the amount of that person's gift will default to DePelchin.  Kathy is
receiving thank you notes by e-mail so I wanted to share with you.
