Steve:  FYI.  Don't worry about the conference call, but thought it might be
useful to review the proposals prior to Monday's meeting.
See you Monday.
Happy Thanksgiving to all.
Best,
Jeff

Several IEP companies have been invited to a meeting with the Governor,s
staff next Monday, November 27th.
The following are some options, which the Governor,s office is considering.
IEP is doing some preliminary research on some of these topics.  IEP would
like to arrange a teleconference call around noon on Monday, November 27th to
discuss the Governor,s meeting.  Please advise us as to whether your have
been invited, and who you are sending.
California,s electricity supply situation has two inter-related problems )
(1) high wholesale electricity costs, and (2) marginally adequate supply of
generation ) both have combined to create a dysfunctional wholesale
electricity market.  The goals should be:
To assure reliable electricity to California consumers for the lowest
reasonable cost.
o Consider requiring that all in-state generation be sold in state.
o Consider re-asserting state authority over the operation, maintenance and
safety practices of all in-state generating facilities, for public health and
safety purposes.
o Consider developing a state power authority to build generation and
own/operate transmission.
o Consider requiring utilities both to retain existing and to build new
generation.
o Consider providing utilities with authority to stabilize retail prices to
be paid by consumers through development of an energy portfolio that reduces
exposure to spot markets, including contracting forward for much more of
their unmet power needs.
o Consider extending consumer rate freeze.
o Consider centralizing power plant dispatch like the other ISOs in the rest
of the country.
o Consider eliminating the ISO and assigning its functions to either a state
or private entity that can acquire the transmission facilities, and control
the electricity transmission grid (MUNIs have proposed this).
o Consider sponsoring/supporting legislation to change the ISO and PX boards
to increase accountability.
o Expand energy conservation programs focused both on immediate peak demand
reduction and on longer term, broader-based programs.
o Aggressively work to site new generation and transmission facilities, to
streamline permitting, and to develop renewable resources.
o Call for/sponsor federal FERC reform legislation that would:
o Impose a regional price cap that varies by time of day and year;
o Set requirements for FERC to use its retroactive refund authority;
o Improve FERC enforcement over price gouging practices;
o Affirm the role of states to protect their customers from unjust prices.
o Pressure the FERC to do its job to (1) bring about responsible seller
behavior in wholesale electric markets through price controls and other
market interventions as necessary, and (2) provide refunds to affected
consumers.
