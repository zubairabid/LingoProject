Hello everyone,

I am writing to confirm your participation in the RFF Council & Board of
Directors meetings on Wednesday, October 10 and Thursday, October 11,
respectively. In light of the events of September 11 and subsequent
travel difficulties, we thought we'd double check with our out-of-town
Directors on their attendance. We hope you are still able to join us.

If your plans have changed in any way, please let me know at your
earliest convenience. We look forward to seeing you!

Regards,
Susan
