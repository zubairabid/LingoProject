Tim,

John's communication regarding not updating December was in order to complete December liquidations for accounting and settlements last week.  However, we were then informed that settlements would not draft their billing until the 14th of January so we then retracted our 'hold' on updating December schedule.  Any updates that can be made in order for settlements to get the most accurate data would be most appreciated.

In addition, the cash flow forecast (as indicated by Don) will be coordinated through Kristin.  I do not believe you will have to do any work for this as all the data will come from our risk calculations and true settlement information.

Thanks,
Stacey
