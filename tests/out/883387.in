Paul,
Several thoughts to help the refinement process.
1.  It would be useful to understand the basis of your numbers.  A key variable in this analysis is the volume of LPG generated, which is dependent on the volume and composition of the LNG.
2.  Re #4 below, at this point I think that the $1.83 MM per year difference in cost justifies building a larger tank.  Not only on a strictly ROI basis, but also based on simplifying logistics of not having to deal with as many ships.  Given the uncertainty of this deal, we are looking at one propane and one butane tank, 50000 m3 and 30000 m3, both fully refrigerated.  The ships must be able to accept fully refrigerated products.  If not, we will have to heat it up before putting on the ship.
3.  Re #11 below, I agree that if we extract C3+ (and not C2+) then we should fractionate to a spec propane and spec butane.  We have not spent any time considering fractionating the butane to iso and normal.  I think that this is a refinement that will be very dependent on the volume of the butane stream.  Many users that appreciate the difference between iso and normal have their own fractionation equipment.
4.  The bigger issue is whether LPG BTUs can justify the $40 mm LPG extraction equipment.  Is anyone working on this aspect of the deal?
5.  Finally, Tess Dyar has found some information on LPG usage in the Bahamas.  We will probably have to sell into this market at a lower the price.  Freeport will be easy, Nassau will require some shipping.

Information on LPGs in Bahamas:
1. Propane is the most used (only minimal/tiny quantities of butane--not worth mentioning)
2. Propane usage (annual basis):
Freeport: 1.5 MM gallons
Nassau: 9.0 MM gallons
Total: 10.5 MM gallons
At avg price of between $1.60-1.70/gallon (without duties), this is an approximately $18MM industry.
