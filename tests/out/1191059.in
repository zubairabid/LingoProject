I had a brief conversation this morning with John Suttle (Credit) and it
looks like he's going to insist on the CSA.  We are going to talk tomorrow
and go through the whole agreement to get the rest of his comments.  While we
have documentation for transactions entered into prior to execution of a
master agreement, the extent of their revisions makes me very uneasy.  Many
of these points are very serious and if they can not agree we will have
trouble coming to agreement even on the short form documents.  It would be
helpful if they could explain the changes rather than just sending us a
mark-up.

Following are my points responsive to their revisions:

Part 1 (a)  The addition of our affiliates has the affect of expanding the
possible defaults too broadly and we cannot agree to these changes (for
example, this would mean that if any Enron affiliate went into bankruptcy
this agreement would be in default).

(g)  This provision provides additional flexibility without any credit risk
to the other party.  It should remain in place unless IBJ can articulate a
reason to remove it.

Part 3 The language inserted is much to vague.  Our original version spells
out exactly what is expected of the parties.  If the documents we listed are
not acceptable, IBJ should tell us now what would be acceptable and if we
agree we will put it in the agreement.

Part 4 (f)  By deleting the word "not" in this provision, IBJ is saying that
payments due to each other with respect to the same transaction will not net
(i.e. if we are paying fixed and they are paying floating, we each have to
make the full payment to the other rather than netting the two amounts to one
payment).  This is not acceptable.

(h) If IBJ will use their NY branch as agent, we should use Enron Corp or ENA.

Part 5 (a) Our suggested language allows the purchaser of an option to
receive payments due even though technically in default under another
provision of the agreement.  Our position is that if there are no other
possible payment requirements due from the purchaser, the option should be
honored.

(c)  The section we delete requires that the market makers be in the same
city.  For many markets in which we participate, it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to find multiple market makers in the same city.

(e)  The change to 10 business days is much too long.  This means we can not
have certainty as to the terms of the transaction for two weeks!  We can go
as high as three days if necessary but even that is beyond common market
practice.

(g)  Their changes remove the ability to set off against obligations owed to
multiple Enron companies if they default and only allows set-off with each
IBJ branch as a separate entity.  This may not be an issue if we will never
trade or otherwise transact with them in any other Enron company and if we
will never do business with any other branch of IBJ.  We usually don't like
to restrict ourselves that way.

(i)  We absolutely insist on the confidentiality of our transactions.  If
there is some revision to this section they would like we can discuss it but
wholesale deletion is out of the question.

(j)  As with Part 1 (g) this section adds flexibility to both parties while
maintaining flexibility within the corporate family.  Given the frequency
with which Enron moves businesses around within the family, this section is
important to us.

(k)  This section results from an experience we had with a counterparty that
went into bankruptcy (and therefore default) while they were in the money.
We disputed the amount owed and under the terms of the agreement (without our
revision) we would have owed them interest at their cost of funds - a rather
high rate given their status as a bankrupt.  We feel the non-default rate is
more appropriate.

(m)  I can't imagine why they wouldn't want this section included - it
protects us both.

(n)  You know more about this than I.

Part 6  These are all important issues for us and we can discuss them
individually if they object for some articulated reason.  If these provisions
are not included here they will need to be included in each confirmation (a
significant burden for our back office systems which are not set up for it)
and we need to know now if they object to any of them.

Other revisions that they have made are acceptable unless Credit objects.  I
hope this is helpful and sorry to have run on so long.  I'm happy to discuss
any of these issues at greater length if you want.  It sounds to me like
IBJ's expectations regarding execution of documents are a bit high given the
volume and nature of their comments.
