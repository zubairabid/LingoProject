From additional conversations with the Ed Duncan and Mike Day --

It looks as if WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEEK A STAY/REQUEST FOR REHEARING FROM THE CPUC BEFORE WE CAN FILE WITH THE COURTS.    We also have to include ALL our points in the CPUC filing or we CANNOT bring them up with the courts.

To be able to get to court ASAP, we will want to file Friday AM, presuming a Thursday pm vote for a July 1 or other retro date.

That means we need to line up all the joint parties AND get them to file declarations identifying their "irreparable harm".

I am working with Jeremy Blachman to see if can get some customers to sign on and with other ESPs -- I have a few who have agreed so far.

The attorney is preparing pro-forma declarations that each company/customer would file under protective seal.  We need to identify who at Enron would be filing this and get it going.  Arter and Hadden is preparing a draft as we speak and I'll be able to get it out right away.

Meanwhile, Dan Douglass will be working on preparing the CPUC filing, which will be developed from the court pleading we were working on.

Please let me know ASAP.
