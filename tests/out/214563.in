As part of its implementation of the National Energy Policy (NEP) issued last
week, the Administration today published two two executive orders in the
Federal Register.  The first order, No. 13211, requires that agencies prepare
a Statement of Energy Effects when an agency undertakes actions that are
likely to have a significant effect upon the supply, transmission, or use of
energy. The Statement of Energy Effects is designed  to provide useful energy
related information and allow for better decision-making.  The second order,
No.13212, encourages agencies to expedite their review and approval of new
energy projects.
