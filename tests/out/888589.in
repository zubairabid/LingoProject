Gang:

Further clarification on what happened at the pre-hearing conference today:

The Judge set he would rule on only two issues at this time (most likely the ruling will be out within a week):

1.  PX Audit -- The Commission will decide the issue on the current record (this is fine with us)
2. Implementation of Suspension of DA. -- This includes all the DASR issues, ability to make amendments as well as ESP assignments and the like.  The Judge decided he could rule after paper hearings.  The following schedule was agreed to:

11/16 -- Utilities file their proposal with the intent for it to be uniform for all three utilities
11/28 -- Parties file comments on utilities' proposal; may request hearings on specific issues and justify why needed (although the Judge already said he did not believe that hearings were necessary)
12/4 -- Parties file responses on the comments

All other issues will be addressed at another Pre-hearing conference on 12/12.

In response to a question, the Judge said he would not issue a ruling on the retroactive suspension of direct access at this time, but did not believe that hearings were required on the issue.

He also said several times, however, that hearings would be required on all issues that involved dollars and cents. (To most logical people, this would seem to conflict with the notion that no hearings were required on the retroactivity issue  --  but, hey, this is California.)

Bottomline:  This turned out better than we had expected.  We wanted hearings on the money issues and any delay in addressing the retroactivity issue is good for our side.
