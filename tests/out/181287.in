Senate Rules Committee just gave permission to Senator Dunn to issue
subpoenas to energy suppliers.  Senator Ross Johnson requested subpoenas
for DWP and DWR as well, but Senator Burton asked Senator Dunn to send
registered letters to DWP and DWR asking for similar information and
giving them 7 days to respond.  After Senator Burton sees their
responses, he will consider whether or not to authorize more subpoenas.
Senator Dunn's request to subpoena FERC was not approved.
