Mike, I spoke to Ralph and he gave me an open week of April 17th in San
Francisco.  He thought that one day would be more that adequate.  I need to
have somebody contact the PG&E side for their availablity during that week.
Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end
with our legal contacting their legal?

Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was
the following:

PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the
gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a
customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry
of the unknown)

Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing

Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal

Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage
their PCBs

Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental
impacts have occurred
