Kevin:

My lack of response this week has not been because I have not been thinking about a possible structure.  It is because the new FERC cap is making it difficult to figure out how a project like this is going to operate.  A few thoughts:

I.  CDWR Dispatch Issues:  It remains unclear to me how the communication with GWF/CDWR will work each day.  What time will we get an indication of the volume they want?  If the communication occurs late, it will be difficult to obtain much value from the capacity they do not need.  Even if the communication occurs late, with the current cap there is little value in the "extra" MWs at your heat rate, given the current FERC cap and gas prices.  Given that there could be very little value on the "extra" MWs, we would ask for a monthly fee in the neighborhood of $10,000 to schedule the CDWR volumes.  To fine tune this number we need to clarify a few things.  Will we be invoicing CDWR?  What is the scheduling timing?  What is the Enron liability for failure to submit the schedule?  Do you want us to submit supplemental bids for your "extra" capacity on your behalf to abide by the FERC order?  What happens if you are dispatched at a loss when we forget to put in Supplemental Energy Bids.

2.  Gas Pricing:  Here is a summary of possible gas pricing for you.

1.		GWF pays demand charge equal to Maximum Daily Quantity (MDQ) times $.05/MMBtu.
2.		GWF schedules gas each day with the Enron up to the MDQ.  The Daily Contract Quantity (DCQ) is the amount GWF schedules each day.
3.	Quantities above the DCQ can be made available on a mutually acceptable basis.
4.  	GWF pays variable charge equal to DCQ times Gas Daily Mid-Point for PG&E City gate, plus $.05/MMBtu.
5.	GWF can substititue for the Gas Daily price with a NGI PG&E City Gate Price or a Fixed Price upon mutual agreement..
6.	GWF responsible for any imbalance charges resulting from using a volume different than the DCQ.
7.	Enron responsible for imbalance charges when they deliver a quantity other than the DCQ.
8.	The Monthly Consumption Quantity (MCQ) is the sum of daily usage.
9.	If GWF does not want to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool, GWF will be responsible for managing imbalances between the DCQ and actual 	usage.
10.	If GWF wants to be in the Enron Enron Contracted marketer Pool, differences between the MCQ and the sum of the DCQs shall be cashed out as follows 	provided Imbalance Charges are not incurred. EPMI will purchase the volume by which the sum of the DCQs exceeds the MCQ at the average of the 5 	highest days Gas Daily Mid-Point and sell the volume by which the sum of the DCQs is less than the MCQ at the average of the 5 lowest days Gas Daily Mid-	Point. If Imbalance Charges are incurred then either 6 or 7 would apply.

In conclusion, I recognize that you might think $10k/Month is steep.  However, Scheduling Coordination is labor intensive and risky, particularly with the FERC cap and the political quagmire.  That said, I definitely think we can help you guys optimize your generation, but .  At a minimum we can buy your energy from time to time.  We can also set you up with Enron Online for no cost, providing the most transparent price information available in the industry today.  For these reasons, I want to get Master Agreements in place.  The first step in this process is for you to provide financial statements.  Can you send those to me?

Something that might work for you guys is to use the APX to be your SC.  This will require more work  on your part, but it is a low cost option.

Another thing is to watch out for firms offering low prices for SC services without giving you a clear indication of what they will pay you for your "extra" MWs.  They will  make their $ somewhere.Do not limit yourself to one counterparty.  IN this age you need multiple trading partners to optimize your generation.

I will call to discuss.

Thanks

Chris
