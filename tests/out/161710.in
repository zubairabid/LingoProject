We need to all talk Tuesday morning ASAP - I am frankly sick and  tired of
self-delusion in the face of a stark and bleak reality in Sacramento- As a
Democrat, it is clear to me that the Democrats from Gray on down are a lost
cause( their response, from a public policy perspective, is shameful in its
shortsidedness and contemptible in its lack of thoughtfulness and intellect-
the Democrat's response in Cal. makes me ashamed to call myself a Democrat)
and the Republicans too small a minority in Ca. to make a difference- From my
vantage point ,nothing good and some( potentially much) bad came out of the
three bills passed. We have a huge uphill battle coming in the next session
and the prospects of further thoughtless retrenchment on the part of the
Governor and legislature very high- to begin the preperation for that
struggle,  we first have to be honest with ourselves and end any petty
bickering internally on intrepretations of brutally clear  events and
oucomes, events and outcomes which are the equivalent of getting hit upside
the head by a 2 by  4, i.e; that usually does'nt require intrepretation or
discussion as to whether it hurt... We end the self-delusion starting on
Tuesday. Jeff- please arrange the call - all are invited .
