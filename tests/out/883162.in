See attached month-by-month reports for default customers for NSTAR companies for purposes of our deal commencing 7/1/01 with them.  As a reminder, we are serving 25% of their residential  default load for 1 year from 7/1/01.   Residential classes are as follows:  BECO R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4;  Cambridge R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6;  Commonwealth R-1, R-2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6.

Info that we can expect to get from NSTAR during the course of the transaction includes:


Monthly updates to this report
Notification of know changes in customer load that in the aggregate would have an impact of 5 MW or more

We are not going to be getting 7-day forecasted loads from NSTAR as we did in the Standard Offer deal we had with them for Q4 2000 (they do not prepare this internally anymore).   Please call me with any questions or of you think we need anything else to manage the position.  Thanks
