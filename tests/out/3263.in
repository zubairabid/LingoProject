I hope to clarify my earlier e-mail and answer your questions -
The "transmissionless" transactions that we developed business practice #11
around are CA to CA interchanges.  Historically, participants at the MIDC
would track purchases and sales of energy between each other as scheduled
interchange between their control areas.  The participants all have owned
and/or contracted transmission to/from their systems.
When tagging came along, authoring PSEs for these MIDC deals just wanted to
do a tag with one source control area and once sink control area with no
transmission segments.  There could be a dozen marketers (thus, a dozen
title transfers) in the chain, but the tag would not indicate transmission,
just interchange between source and sink CAs (limited to CA participants at
the MIDC).
At some point (1.5 or 1.6?) E-Tag required a tag to contain at least one
transmission segment.  The WSCC approached the IS to allow for no
transmission segments in a tag.  We were told no.  So, the business practice
of picking the source (or the sink) CA's TP to provide a MIDC-MIDC
transmission segment was adopted.
Hope answers your question.
