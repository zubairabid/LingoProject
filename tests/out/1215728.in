Hello, RRG members and other interested  parties.

As many of you know already, FERC issued on combined order  on the RTO West
and TransConnect proposal filings on April 26, 2001 (Docket Nos.  RT01-35-000
and RT01-15-000).

Because it can sometimes be difficult to retrieve  documents from the FERC
Website, we have posted the FERC order (and related  press release) on the
RTO West Website, both on the RTO West proposal filing  page and on the
TransConnect proposal filing page. Those links  are:

http://208.55.67.64/Index_Page_TransConnect_Filing.htm

Because FERC's April 26 order relating to  amitigation and market monitoring
plan for the California wholesale  electricity markets may also be of
interest,we haveposted that  orderand its related press release (in Docket
No. EL00-95-012, as well as  others) on the Webpage RTO Westset up for
selected FERC orders and filings  related to California. That link is at:

http://208.55.67.64/FERC_CalOrders.htm

Finally,Avista, Bonneville, Puget Sound Energy, and  Sierra Pacific and
Nevada Power have made their filings in FERC Docket No.  EL01-47-000 (the
"Removing Obstacles" docket) available on the RTO West  Website. Those
filings are posted at:

Thank you very much!
