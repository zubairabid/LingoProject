Hello Team:
After carefully reviewing the success of our walk, we began to value and understand what needs to be done for next year.  Continuing to be proactive, we are starting today to get ready for next year.  Attached is a list of items split into three categories -
what we did well
which areas are identified for improvement
what sort of new things we could accomplish
By working together, we can continue to produce successful endeavors like the walk.  Everyone was fantastic in time, deed, and effort.  We should feel a great deal of pride.  By the way, feel free to email any additions to the list; I will collect those items and strike a new copy.  I also have new thank you letter text and merge documents for those that wish to thank their contributors.  Email me and I will send the files.
Thanks.
