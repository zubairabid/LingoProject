AA has concurred with MTM accounting for the South America commodity transactions, so long as they have MTM attributes (which is no different of a standard than any other bus unit). They would, however, like to update their general knowledge of the South American regulatory and commercial environment, etc.  Do we have some presentation materials already done that would be helpful in this regard? Again, as expected, we are a "go" for MTM.
