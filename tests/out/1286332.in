We are in the midst of negotiating with Coconut Creek and the other petitioners a global settlement agreement for both the Creek lawsuit and the administrative hearings for Pompano and Deerfield.   Assuming we are successful and the petitioners drop their request for the administrative hearings, what are the remaining outstanding issues with the DEP?  How do you recommend we handle DEP's latest notice of change for Pompano and when do you recommend we issue our response to the change?
The anticipated settlement conditions are as follows:
1.	only one facility will have back-up fuel (Enron to choose as some point in time between DBEC or PBEC) while the other facility is gas only.  The oil use and emissions levels are per the air permit (which may or may not be the same depending on the outcome of the Pompano notice of change).
2.	Enron to provide a one time payment for emissions monitoring to be procured, operated and maintained by DPEP.
3.	BACT for the simple cycle facility (basis for current permit) and future conversion to combined cycle should Enron elect to convert.
4.	??? should know the other conditions, if any, later in the week.
