Please review the attached Links Report. (Please note that the Hugoton team is still working on the final scope of work that will take place during their ESD (5/7/02). The original time frame was 2 days, and then changed to just 4 to 6 hours with another outage planned later in the summer. We don't want to have two separate outages, so they are trying to put together a plan for 1 long day.  I'll keep you posted.
FYI,
Some of the planned overhauls for this summer may be approved in the next day or too.
