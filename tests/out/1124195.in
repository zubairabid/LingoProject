Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.


Thanks,

Patrick
