Gentlemen -
The revised counter was delivered to Zaman earlier today.  McGee spoke with
Zaman and later with both Trujillo and Zaman.  They delivered what they
stated, and McGee believes, is their final and bottom line proposal.  They
would not consider Standing Rock as part of this negotiation (although they
would be open to separate negotiation over Standing Rock), they required $15
million up front and $2.34 million per year with a CPI escalator.  This is
just slightly over $29 million in today's dollars.
They wish an answer tomorrow to the proposal.  McGee did not commit to do so
but he did request that Zaman and Trujillo confirm from the Task Force this
Friday whether they had the authority to make this proposal.
