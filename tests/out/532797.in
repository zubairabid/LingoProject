Transmission lines project draws bidders
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 24, 2001)
Aiming to ease one of the festering problems in California's energy crisis,
13 companies and public agencies have bid for the right to widen a notorious
bottleneck in the state's transmission lines, federal officials said Monday.
The bidders range from the East Bay Municipal Utility District to wholesale
power generators such as Mirant Corp., Calpine Corp. and Williams Cos. Some
independent experts argue that if a generator wins the bid, it could use its
control over those transmission lines to manipulate the electricity market.
The bottleneck is Path 15, a narrow 90-mile stretch of power lines near Los
Banos that carries electricity between Northern and Southern California. It
has less transmission capacity than other portions of the power grid, which
has led to blackouts.
In January, Northern California suffered power outages in part because Path
15 couldn't deliver the surplus electricity that was available in Southern
California. The proposed expansion would add 1,500 megawatts of capacity.
"It's a very big issue; there's been a lot of congestion," said Severin
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute.
In addition, the Independent System Operator, which manages the power grid,
estimates the congestion generated by Path 15 added an estimated $221.7
million to California's power bill in a 16-month period that ended in
December.
Borenstein said he believes there are considerable hidden costs as well,
because the bottleneck has created an incentive for sellers to withhold
power. Path 15 effectively cuts California into two separate markets, making
it easier for sellers to manipulate each submarket to raise prices, he said.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which owns the existing Path 15 transmission
lines, already has been conducting environmental studies with an eye toward
widening the path. To speed things along, the federal government in May asked
for bids on the project, which sparked proposals from generators and others.
Borenstein said having a generator widen Path 15 could bring new problems.
Whoever builds the additional power lines owns them and can charge "tolls" to
companies that use the lines to transmit electricity. A power generator could
deliberately withhold supplies, thereby increasing the congestion on Path 15,
and increase the tolls, Borenstein said.
PG&E is among those bidding to widen the path. So is its sister company, an
unregulated entity called PG&E National Energy Group. Other bidders include a
partnership led by Sempra Energy Resources, an unregulated sister company of
San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
The federal government estimates it will take $300 million and three or four
years to widen Path 15. The costs are ultimately paid by utility customers.
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, speaking to reporters in Los Angeles
on Monday, called the expansion of Path 15 "a critical component in solving
the long-term power crisis in this state."

Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for
years


(Published July 24, 2001)
The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more
intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee
sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn
over internal documents.
Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has
adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple
investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has
become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.
At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted
criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love
to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a
tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With
less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based
companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor
suppliers to California.
Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that
Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of
President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the
rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are
interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also
filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading
data.
Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating
Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality
agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph
Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a
report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction."
Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's
happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears
about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would
data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data
be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands
of class-action attorneys?
Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will
be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative
purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of
turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was
leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that
private lawyers are working closely with investigators.
Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove
collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few
dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings,
that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create
artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted
the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent
System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that
ISO had ordered the plant operational changes.
Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now
under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents
that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation.
Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary.
Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help
in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said
he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides.
The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes
will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at
least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their
utility bill checks.

Initiative effort seeks to lower natural-gas prices
By Jim Miller
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 24, 2001)
Amid higher utility rates, the threat of rolling blackouts and legislative
indecision on how to solve California's energy problems, there is one
proposal to get voters involved.
A ballot initiative to let cities, counties and other public agencies, such
as municipal utilities and irrigation districts, buy and sell natural gas has
been cleared for signature collection by the secretary of state's office.
The initiative emerged from the office of Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza,
D-Merced, whose district includes three electricity-supplying irrigation
districts.
To Cardoza and others, putting public agencies in the natural-gas business
would result in lower gas and electricity prices for consumers because most
generators run on natural gas.
Cardoza's proposal is the first of what observers say could be several
energy-related measures on future ballots.
For months, consumer advocates have warned that they would use the initiative
process if they feel lawmakers are saddling taxpayers with the costs of the
state's botched energy deregulation.
"As soon as we find out what the Legislature has done or has not done this
fall, we'll react appropriately," said Jamie Court, executive director of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the groups considering an
initiative.
"If there's a bailout (of utilities), we'll go to the ballot box. If there
isn't a bailout, it's not clear what we'll do," Court said. "Right now, we're
fund raising to be able to have the capacity to do whatever needs to be
done."
The future of Cardoza's initiative is uncertain.
Since its approval by the secretary of state's office May 29, there has been
no effort to collect signatures or to raise money for a campaign. The
initiative needs the signatures of 670,816 registered voters by Oct. 26 to
qualify for the ballot.
The electric industry strongly opposes the Cardoza initiative.
"This came about during the winter because it looked like there was going to
be a natural-gas shortage," said Stephanie Espinosa, a spokeswoman for
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. "Since then, we've been able to provide
sufficient natural gas to our customers."
A recent poll, however, showed Californians may be in the mood to approve
energy-related ballot measures. The Public Policy Institute of California
poll found that 65 percent of all adults believe measures on the 2002 ballot
are the best way to solve the energy crisis. Thirty percent said the
Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis would provide the best solution.

Daniel Weintraub: There's no shame in doing nothing for Edison


(Published July 24, 2001)

To understand why state lawmakers are inching closer to handing over billions
of dollars of consumers' money to California's second-largest utility, you
need to appreciate the collective psyche of the Legislature. Not appreciate
as in enjoy. But appreciate in a scientific way, in the manner of an
anthropologist studying the mores of a foreign culture.
Confronted with a big problem, legislators think they need to solve it. Doing
nothing is not a comfortable option. It makes them feel ineffective and
impotent. When the governor is demanding a bill, the pressure grows even more
intense. They want to do something -- anything -- rather than having to go
back to their districts and admit that the problem is not theirs to fix.
In this case, though, doing nothing might be the wisest course.
Lawmakers now have on their desks three bills that take various approaches to
rescuing Southern California Edison from the brink of bankruptcy. The company
has a $3.5 billion debt left over from the state's failed experiment in
electricity deregulation. If something isn't done about it in the next few
weeks, the utility's future is likely to wind up in the hands of a judge.
But all three bills ignore a fundamental fact: Edison got itself into this
mess. Maybe the utility should get itself out.
Edison was a big cheerleader for the 1996 bill that restructured the way
electricity was bought and sold in California. Supporting a freeze on retail
rates, which was the centerpiece of that legislation, the company took a huge
gamble. If wholesale prices remained low, Edison would rake in billions by
capturing the difference between the price it paid for power and the much
higher price it was allowed to charge its customers. The money would go to
compensate the utility for power plants it built as a regulated monopoly,
plants that might no longer be profitable in a free-market, competitive
industry.
Like all gambles, this one came with a risk. If wholesale prices rose, they
might exceed the retail rate cap. Edison would be forced to sell its
electricity at retail for less than it was paying in the wholesale market.
The tide of dollars that flowed in so nicely would begin to flow back out
again.
And that's exactly what happened. Some of the world's smartest utility minds
guessed wrong. An electricity surplus turned into a shortage. Wholesale
prices soared. Things got so bad at Edison that the state stepped in to buy
power on the company's behalf.
But before things got ugly, Edison enjoyed two flush years of artificially
high rates. During 1998 and 1999, the company pocketed billions from its
customers, paid down debt and sent money to its parent firm, Edison
International.
Now Edison wants to divide the question. The money that flowed in, Edison
says, the company should get to keep. And the money that flowed out -- well,
that should be someone else's responsibility. The utility is asking the
Legislature to ignore the first two years of hefty profits and reimburse the
company for the one year of big losses.
Gov. Gray Davis negotiated his version of the Edison bailout several months
ago, but that deal was seen as so rich for the company that it went nowhere
in the Legislature. The Senate approved its version last week, a bill that
would reduce the payout to Edison by $1 billion and then stick business with
the remaining tab. The Assembly, meanwhile, is considering two other
measures, both of which would spread the pain between business and
residential consumers.
"This is corporate welfare at its worst," state Sen. Bill Morrow,
R-Oceanside, said of the Senate bill. "This is not even a bailout. It's a
corporate handout."
Edison and the state's other big utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which is
already in bankruptcy, say they are entitled to the money because they never
should have been put in the position of charging less for electricity than
they were paying to obtain it. That's a legal argument that belongs before a
judge. There is a good chance the court would want to balance the profits the
utilities made under deregulation with the losses they incurred. Under that
scenario, they wouldn't need a bailout.
But even if the utilities were to win their case, consumers probably would
fare no worse than they would under the various legislative proposals under
consideration.
Sen. Steve Peace, D-San Diego, who helped craft the 1996 bill that
restructured the industry and who now supports the Edison bailout, lectured
his fellow senators on the floor the other day about the need to take a risk.
"We can do nothing and be safe," Peace said. "Or we can do something, and do
our job."
Everyone is weary of the state's energy crisis. It is human nature to want to
get it behind us, to sweep it away, even at great cost. But lawmakers
shouldn't feel it's their job to "do something" -- especially when that thing
carries a multibillion-dollar price tag for consumers.
This time, doing nothing means standing up for ratepayers. What's the shame
in that?

State consultants don't see need for more rate hikes


\
objattph
Outlook brightens; price cut may be possible by 2003 By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 23, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- State consultants,
releasing a new estimate of power costs with an improved outlook, said
yesterday they do not believe an additional rate increase will be needed --
and a rate cut may be possible by 2003.  The state issued a long-awaited
"revenue requirement" asking for a little more than half of the revenue from
a record rate increase imposed by the state Public Utilities Commission
earlier this year.  The state power-purchasing agency, the Department of
Water Resources, wants 1.65 cents of an increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour
that began last month for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern
California Edison.
The PUC is not expected to rule on the state's revenue request until the
middle of next month, when the regulators also are scheduled to approve an
increase for the customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.  PG&E and Edison did
not immediately say whether the state's proposal would leave enough money for
the utilities. But as if expecting criticism, the state consultants said
utilities often ask for larger rate increases than they are granted.  An
adviser to Gov. Gray Davis said the administration was "mocked" by critics
when it forecast in April that the average cost of power would drop during
the summer, even though heat would drive up the demand for power.  "Quote:
'They just don't know what they are doing,' " consultant S. David Freeman
recalled the critics saying. "Well, we did know what we were doing. Quite
frankly, I think this is a good-news story of major proportions."  The widely
derided forecast issued in April said the average cost of power that must be
purchased on the expensive spot market would drop from $346 per megawatt-hour
in April through June to $195 in July through September.  Now the "reasonably
conservative" estimate is that the average price of power in July through
September will be $129 to $130 per megawatt-hour, said Ron Nichols of
Navigant Consulting.  Nichols attributed the price drop to a number of
factors: long-term contracts, cooler weather, cheaper natural gas used by
generators, more small and large generators back online and floating federal
price caps.  The state began buying power for utility customers Jan. 17 after
PG&E and Edison, whose rates were frozen by deregulation as wholesale power
costs soared, ran up massive debts and were no longer able to borrow.  The
consultants estimated that the state will have spent $13 billion on power by
the end of next year. But they also predicted that the state power-purchasing
fund would develop a substantial surplus by then.  "That would allow for a
rate decrease in 2003, based on our current projections," said Joseph Fichera
of Saber Partners.  The new revenue requirement issued by the state yesterday
is needed for a series of actions planned by the PUC next month to pay for a
record bond issue to repay the taxpayer-supported state general fund for
power purchases.  Fichera said that, despite reports to the contrary, the
recommendation is for a $12.5 billion bond -- leaving a cushion in the
authorization of $13.4 billion. The bond will be paid off by ratepayers over
15 years.  The consultants said their projection of state power costs is
cautious. They assume consumer conservation will drop from 7 percent to 6
percent, though it actually has been 11 percent and 12 percent in recent
months.  The projections are intended to leave some ability to absorb
unforeseen costs, such as scorching temperatures later this summer or next
summer, or a spike in natural gas prices as happened last winter.  The cost
projections do not include any overcharge refund from generators. Davis has
asked federal regulators for an $8.9 billion refund and has vowed to seek
full recovery in the courts.  The governor wants to get the state out of the
power-buying business by the end of next year. But that requires legislative
approval of a rescue plan for Edison that could become a model for getting
PG&E out of bankruptcy.  The Senate, which left for a monthlong recess after
approving a state budget early yesterday, approved an Edison rescue plan that
the utility says is too weak to restore its ability to borrow.  The Assembly
is struggling with two competing Edison rescue plans. Talks may continue
during the recess in an attempt to reach an agreement before the Aug. 15
deadline set by Davis to reach a deal to keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  The
consultants say there is enough room in the existing rates to give the two
utilities a revenue stream for bonds to pay off their debts -- 0.4 cent per
kilowatt-hour for Edison and 0.7 cent for PG&E.  Fichera said he disagrees
with speculation that falling power prices and the rate increase might give
Edison enough revenue to avoid bankruptcy without a legislative rescue plan.
To pay off Edison's $3.5 billion debt, he said, $2 billion would come from
the bond, but $1.5 billion would have to come from the sale of Edison's
transmission system to the state under the governor's plan.







Senate committee told Morgan Stanley destroyed power records


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 23, 2001  SACRAMENTO ) Morgan Stanley, a multibillion
dollar financial firm and adviser to several power generators, destroyed
documents that potentially could show efforts to gouge California consumers )
and a state Senate committee wants to know why.  The company recently also
has come under the scrutiny of an Oregon lawmaker who is concerned the
company's purchase of the rights to move power between California and Oregon
could result in artificially high prices.  For several weeks, Morgan Stanley
had told the committee it would provide the documents, but said last week
they had been destroyed as a matter of routine "years ago," said Sen. Joe
Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee's chairman.  Members of the committee are
trying to determine whether power companies worked together to raise prices
by purposefully holding back electricity to drive up demand.  Morgan
Stanley's involvement would have been several years ago, when it advised
out-of-state energy companies to buy California power plants up for sale.  A
Morgan Stanley attorney told the Orange County Register that the company did
not destroy any documents after Dunn's committee requested the documents May
16.  "At the end of the project, they decided what they were going to keep
and what they weren't going to keep, and those decisions were made years
before the energy crisis and years before the committee existed," said Paul
Patono, a company attorney.  Dunn noted it is not illegal to raise prices as
long as a company doesn't collude to force prices upward.  Private utilities
became able to sell their plants as part of the 1996 plan to deregulate the
electricity market. Although the plants were expected to sell below their
book value, they instead sold for up to three times that price, although the
state then had an oversupply of electricity and old plants.  While the public
was told deregulation would lead to lower electricity prices, energy
officials and experts testifying before the committee have said it's unlikely
investors would buy aging power plants if they believed that to be true.
Dunn is curious if there was any kind of plan or advertising that said the
plants, if bought a certain way, would give of the buyers market power in the
wholesale electricity market.  The committee is still moving forward with
contempt proceedings against Houston-based power marketers Enron Corp. and
Reliant Energy for refusing to hand over documents to committee
investigators.  New York-based Morgan Stanley, now Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
& Co., got into the energy trading in 1984 and now is one of the top 20 U.S.
power marketers.  The company also has come under the scope of Rep. Peter
DeFazio, D-Ore. Morgan Stanley bought the rights to transmit just under a
third of the power flowing between California and Oregon from the Bonneville
Power Administration through February 2002.  DeFazio has written a letter to
the BPA, asking that the agency make sure the Northwest keeps its "reliable,
affordable" energy source.  "The ability of a financial services company,
which has no obligation to serve electricity consumers, to lock up all
available capacity for a year raises serious concerns," DeFazio wrote.  A
company spokeswoman said Morgan Stanley acquired the transmission capacity
from BPA to meet its power delivery obligations in the Northwest, and had no
intention of manipulating the market.








News briefs on the California power crisis


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 24, 2001  IRVINE ) Future Olympic swimmers in Southern
California may no longer have a training facility if the state's power crisis
continues.  Utility bills have jumped significantly over the past couple of
months and aquatic centers across Southern California have felt the pinch.
At Heritage Park in Irvine, home to gold medalist Amanda Beard and silver
medalist Aaron Peirsol, the monthly energy bill has doubled from $7,000 to
between $13,000 and $15,000.  Officials at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in
Pasadena have raised membership fees 10 percent to offset electricity costs
that have more than doubled.  The Industry Hills Aquatics Complex in Industry
may close its doors on Sept. 9, in part because of the rate increases.
Gas-powered heaters and electric motors run 24 hours a day at most swimming
centers to keep water temperatures warm. Some swim coaches said a temperature
drop in the pool can hamper an athlete's training regiment and possibly raise
health concerns.  Swimming facilities run on a tight budget, say coaches, and
the soaring energy costs have eaten away any profit margins the training
programs once had.  The Industry Hills facility has even used trash and
methane gas from the landfill it sits on to heat the pool. But the complex
lost about $85,000 last year and operators expect natural gas costs will
double this winter. The property management company, which owns the land, has
given a Sept. 9 deadline to reduce operating costs or close the swimming
center.  ))  CHINO ) The largest of 11 power plants that are supposed to be
built by Sept. 30 under the governor's emergency fast-track program appears
to be running behind schedule.  The concrete foundation hasn't been poured at
the $125-million natural gas facility, which sits near the California
Institution for Men in Chino. The plant, being built by Delta Power Co. of
New Jersey, would supply about 135,000 homes with electricity.
Environmentalists warn that the plant will produce smog five times more than
the legal limit and want state air quality officials, who will conduct a
hearing Tuesday, to deny a final operating permit to Delta Power.  Delta
officials said they hope to meet the Sept. 30 deadline despite the objections
by environmentalists and residents who live near the proposed plant. They
also pledged to install equipment by November that would reduce nitrogen
oxide compounds, which contribute to smog.  If Delta and other energy
companies finish their power plants by the end of September, they receive
incentives such as eliminating environmental analyses and the ability to emit
pollutants for months at levels exceeding state standards.







State sells surplus power at a loss


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 23, 2001  LOS ANGELES ) State officials sold excess
electricity at a loss of nearly $14 million in the first 16 days of July )
roughly 4.5 percent of the total amount the state spent on power during that
period.  According to the Department of Water Resources, the state purchased
3.5 million megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour. It
sold off 177,000 surplus megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per
megawatt-hour.  Industry officials told the Los Angeles Times it is routine
for utilities and electric companies to at times either sell power at a loss,
work out an exchange or give it away when they find themselves with surplus
power. However, some say this is an indication that the state government does
not belong in the power business.  The sales of surplus power "get to the
issue of, do these people really know what they're doing? Are they really
competent to be managing this to the lowest cost for the ratepayers?" said
Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. "It reinforces to me that we should get
the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."  Department of
Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details in response to
an inquiry by Campbell.  Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles, said he
did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.  "Right now the summer is
cool," said Wright, who is also chairman of the Assembly utilities committee.
"If this had been a normal July, we would have used all that power."
Department of Water Resources officials expect the sales to stop if
temperatures heat up later this week.  Department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo
said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the state's
electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a
megawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in
July.  Since January, the state has spent more than $8 billion buying
electricity for the customers of three financially ailing utilities ) Pacific
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and
Electric Co.  The state had to take over buying electricity to keep the
state's lights on after federal energy regulators ruled that only
creditworthy entities could buy electricity.







CHINO
Rush for Power Plant in Chino Raises Concerns
Energy: The facility may exceed pollution limits if it begins operations by
Sept. 30. Opponents say that would endanger public health.
By TERENCE MONMANEY
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

CHINO -- Seldom are government bureaucrats criticized for moving too quickly,
but so goes the battle here over a power plant slated for the sun-blasted
grounds of a men's prison.

The proposed plant--big enough to supply 135,000 homes--is one of five in
California that have been licensed to start up despite exceeding pollution
standards as part of Gov. Gray Davis' rush to bring more power online.

The program, covering small to mid-size facilities that run during hours of
peak demand, slashes licensing review from a year to three weeks, eliminates
comprehensive environmental analyses, and authorizes plants to emit
pollutants for months at levels exceeding state and federal air quality laws.
The catch is that the plants must operate by Sept. 30 or those rare and
lucrative incentives could be withdrawn--a possibility confronting developers
of the Chino plant, which a growing number of environmentalists opposes.

So far, with only 69 days left until the deadline, workers haven't poured a
drop of concrete foundation for the $125-million natural gas-burning
facility, developed by Delta Power Co. of New Jersey. The site is on the
outskirts of the California Institution for Men.

The proposed plant, the largest of 11 so-called peakers given expedited
approval, is galvanizing opposition to the governor's emergency fast-track
program. Environmentalists decry the fact that until the plant installs
devices to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds, which contribute to smog, the
level of the pollutant will reach five times the legal limit.

Five groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Planning
and Conservation League, have joined in petitioning state air quality
officials to deny the plant a final operating permit. They contend that
excess nitrogen oxides will endanger public health and that the fast-track
process jeopardizes decades of gains against smog.

"We're not necessarily opposed to a power plant on the site," said Gail
Ruderman Feuer, an attorney in the Los Angeles office of the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "We're just opposed to one without environmental
review and without all the pollution controls."

Critics also are wary of the fast-track process because the state has a
vested interest in making sure the plants are built quickly. The Davis
administration has promised to spend billions buying electricity from plants
that aren't built yet.

"It's a massive subterfuge," said Sandra Spelliscy, an attorney with the
Planning and Conservation League in Sacramento.

Jay Roland, manager of the Chino facility for Pegasus Power Partners, a
subsidiary of Delta, said the extra nitrogen oxides released from the plant
for a month or so are "not going to cause damage to anybody."

Roland said he is so frustrated by the "interveners," he sometimes wishes the
whole state would go dark, to underscore the power shortage that the plant is
intended to address.

Though opponents have made a tough job even tougher, he said he hoped to make
the end-of-summer deadline. Missing it could mean applying to the state all
over again under the old rules, he said. "Then I sit here nine months with
$120 million in equipment that's not generating any revenue."

State officials said it was necessary to approve the extra-polluting plants
because of the need to avoid blackouts and because there is a backlog of
emissions-control equipment. Besides, they said, state-of-the-art gas-burning
plants emit fewer pollutants without controls than do many older plants with
them.

Kevin Kennedy, a California Energy Commission official who reviewed the Chino
project, acknowledged that public involvement in the process has suffered
somewhat. "It's been difficult to get the word out . . . to make sure people
in the communities have enough information to know what's going on."

Site Seems Ideal for Power Plant

In many respects, the 11-acre Chino site looks right for a power plant. It
rests on flat surplus land at the northern boundary of the state's largest
prison property, where grasslands cover hundreds of acres.

Half a mile away is a booming warehouse district and a Southern California
Edison substation, which would relay the new power to the transmission grid.

Moreover, Pegasus runs a small power plant on the prison property across a
narrow utility road from the site. Supplying steam and a few megawatts to the
penal institution, the company sells the bulk of its 27 megawatt output to
Edison.

Delta's president, Dean Vanech, bristles at charges that his company doesn't
care about the environment.

He said equipment to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds won't be available until
around November, at which time engineers will work "as quickly as humanly
possible" to install it. Other air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and
microscopic dust particles, will be controlled from the beginning.

Also, though energy officials reviewed the proposal in a matter of weeks,
they closely scrutinized the company's nine-part application, which took two
months and $1 million to assemble, plant officials say.

The company moved the plant's site after biologists discovered two protected
bird species nesting nearby--burrowing owls and red-tailed hawks. That
required engineers to redesign gas, water and transmission lines and tinker
with the plant structure, Roland said.

Owlets in a nest by a proposed transmission tower still pose an obstacle. "We
have to wait for the babies to leave," construction manager Robert Surette
said.

Key decisions over the plant's future lie with the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, the air pollution agency, which said in May it would
give the Chino plant a construction permit.

But after environmental groups petitioned in late June, the agency asked
Pegasus for more data describing the possible impact of elevated levels of
nitrogen oxides on people in the plant's vicinity.

"We're still in the evaluation phase, and we're not going to prejudge this
project," said district executive director Barry Wallerstein.

He said the plant emissions were probably negligible compared with those from
the parade of diesel trucks in the nearby warehouse district. Those "could be
a larger health hazard to the community than this particular power plant," he
said.

Public Hearing to Be Held Today

The air quality agency has scheduled a public hearing today at its Diamond
Bar office to weigh issuing the plant a waiver needed to exceed state air
quality standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has indicated it
will not prosecute the Pegasus plant for temporarily emitting more nitrogen
oxides than the federal Clean Air Act permits.

Vanech of Delta said the company would want to build the plant even if it had
not received expedited approval: "The reason we're doing the project is that
we have a favorable long-term view of the California energy market.'

Delta operates 13 power plants nationwide, five of them in California on
state-controlled property.

The Chino plant promises to benefit this diverse, mostly blue-collar city of
66,000. Although the developer is leasing the property from the state, Delta
agreed to pay the city $500,000 up front, plus $75,000 annually and millions
more over the years in water and natural gas fees.

Vanech said the half-million-dollar "host fee" was compensation to City Hall
for its swift handling of the project's mountainous paperwork and for the
wear and tear that construction crews will cause on city roads.

In the neighborhood closest to the plant, where large new houses rest on
half-acre lots fronted by bridle paths, residents seemed divided.

Jim Tippings, 59, who is retired, said he didn't have a problem with the
plant running a month or so without full nitrogen oxide controls: "I don't
think a month is going to hurt us." Rising utility bills are what really
hurt, he said.

Up the street, 35-year-old Kent Hobbenslefken was not aware that a power
plant was going up a mile away. A former hazardous waste manager who sells
health insurance, he was skeptical of the need to run the generators without
full pollution controls, just to meet a bureaucratic deadline.

"What's a couple of months delay?" he said. "We're already in the crisis.
What's it going to do for John Q. Public? Are our rates going to go down? I
don't think so."

Surplus Power Sold at a Loss
Electricity: Cool summer and effective conservation efforts result in excess
supplies. Industry officials say it's a routine move.
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Caught with an excess of electricity as a result of cool
weather and heavy conservation, the state government sold power at a loss
approaching $14 million in the first 16 days of July.

The loss amounts to roughly 3.5% of the total amount the state spent on power
during that period.

To keep power flowing to 27 million Californians, the state purchased 3.5
million megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour,
according to the state Department of Water Resources. It sold off 177,000
surplus megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per megawatt-hour.
Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details
in response to an inquiry by Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine).

The sales of surplus power "get to the issue of, do these people really know
what they're doing? Are they really competent to be managing this to the
lowest cost for the ratepayers?" Campbell said. "It reinforces to me that we
should get the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."

Industry officials, however, say it is routine for utilities and electricity
companies to at times find themselves with more electricity than their
customers need. They either sell the power at a loss, work out an exchange of
power or give it away.

"It's not all that uncommon for utilities to be buying one day and selling
the next," said one Pacific Northwest trader who asked not to be identified
because his company does not permit him to talk to reporters. He said a rule
of thumb in the industry is to match supply to demand within 1% to 2%,
although "5% on a load like California isn't that much."

Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly
utilities committee, said he did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.

"Right now the summer is cool," he said. "If this had been a normal July, we
would have used all that power."

"The worm could have turned the other way."

Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said the state's crew
of 15 power purchasers found themselves selling a "very minimal" amount of
electricity in May. In June, more power was sold, but less than was sold in
July, he said. The department has not released those figures.

Department officials expect the sales to stop if temperatures heat up later
this week.

The water department was thrust into the role of buying 30% to 50% of the
state's overall electricity in January after the state's major utilities
became so financially crippled by high wholesale electricity prices that
energy companies refused to sell to them.

The department has so far spent roughly $8 billion of taxpayer money
purchasing power that is sent to the customers of Pacific Gas & Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.

Hidalgo said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the
state's electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a
megawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in
July.

"If we were out scrambling for power right now," Hidalgo said, "the market
would reflect that and adjust to it, and we would most likely be paying much
more in overall purchases."

Campbell said he assumes the department sold its most expensive, marginal
megawatts of power. But Hidalgo said that is not necessarily so. The
department does not track what it paid for the power it sells, he said.

The department's statement to Campbell shows sales to 25 different companies,
including the federal Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, and several private energy companies that
bought power plants from California's utilities under the state's 1996
deregulation scheme. Those firms include Dynegy Corp., Reliant Energy, Mirant
Corp. and Duke Energy.

Pacific Gas Gets 4-Month Extension on Filing Plan
Bloomberg News

July 24 2001

PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, won a
four-month extension to file a Chapter 11 recovery plan free from
interference from creditors and other groups.

The utility's sole right to file a plan was extended from Aug. 6 to Dec. 6.
Creditors, shareholders and others with a stake in the case could have
presented their own plans had the extension not been granted.

Companies reorganizing under Chapter 11 have the sole right to advance a
recovery plan in the first 120 days after filing for bankruptcy. Courts
routinely extend this period in large and complex cases. A committee
representing unsecured creditors in court papers said it "firmly believes
that all parties in interest should move quickly and provide assurance that
any filed plan will pay creditors in full and remedy PG&E's various issues
and problems."

PG&E Corp. shares fell 75 cents to close at to $14.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

State sells surplus electricity at a loss
BUY HIGH, SELL LOW: $14 million deficit
Paul Feist, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers

California has lost $14 million during the past three weeks selling surplus
electricity back to power generators as mild temperatures and energy
conservation slackened demand statewide.
The state, which has spent more than $8 billion purchasing power on behalf of
financially troubled utilities, became an electricity seller this month,
racking up losses and triggering criticism from Republican lawmakers and
consumer groups.
State Department of Water Resources Director Thomas M. Hannigan said in a
letter that since July 1, the state had sold 177,571 megawatt hours at a rate
of $36.95 each. California paid just over $118 a megawatt hour for the
electricity, Hannigan said in the letter to Assemblyman John Campbell, R-
Irvine.
Some of the exports to 25 buyers went to out-of-state power providers such as
Atlanta-based Mirant and Texas-based Reliant Energy, which a state Senate
committee has found in contempt for not complying with subpoenas for
documents as part of its investigation into alleged price manipulation.
Excess electricity also went to public power agencies such as the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power and even abroad to Powerex, the trading arm of
BC Hydro. The giant Canadian power firm has started issuing rebates to its
customers, citing "strong exports" to California and elsewhere earlier this
year.
"To me this reinforces the idea that the state should get out of the power
buying business as soon as practically possible," Campbell said.
TAXPAYERS GET STUCK
When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. or Southern California Edison makes a similar
mistake, he said, shareholders pay for it. But when the Department of Water
Resources is to blame, taxpayers are left holding the bag.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis defended the losses, calling them minuscule
in the bigger context of the state's power-purchasing strategy.
"This is all an inexact science," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "This
has been a handful of days over seven months, and the amount is minuscule. If
the choice is keeping the lights on or having rolling blackouts, it's a small
risk to take."
Because power can't be stored, all power trading operations are occasionally
forced to sell excess electricity, Maviglio said. He said that people would
have laughed in January had the administration predicted that the state would
have more than enough power this summer.
Mild weather and a strong conservation effort by Californians have led to
days when the state hasn't needed all the power it has on hand.
SHARP DROP IN DEMAND
In recent days, the peak load on California's grid has been around 33,000
megawatts -- far below the 40,000-plus megawatt demand that can come on a hot
summer day.
"When we bought power at these prices, who would have thought that it was
going to be the coolest July in 20 years?" said Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los
Angeles. "The problem becomes when you second-guess things."
The state Department of Water Resources has negotiated about $43 billion
worth of electricity contracts spanning 15 to 20 years. The contracts were
made public after media organizations, including The Chronicle, and GOP
lawmakers sued the Davis administration.
Consumer groups yesterday criticized the losses, calling them an inevitable
byproduct of the state's entry into the power-buying business.
"It's one of the costs of secrecy. You've got an agency that is totally
unaccountable to the public," said Doug Heller, a consumer advocate with the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "They haven't done a great job
of serving the public's needs for energy procurement."
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said Campbell and other critics
were not being fair to the Davis administration.
"You can't say at one time get the energy situation under control, but then
question every line item a month out," she said.

San Diego tries to undo the damage
THE PLAN: Regional public power
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:dlazarus@sfchronicle.com>

San Diego -- This city, which was first to bear the brunt of the state's
energy crisis a year ago as electricity bills tripled, is now aiming to be
first with a long- term solution: regional public power.
A bill is making its way through the Legislature -- and being fought at every
turn by the power industry -- to make San Diego County one of the largest
municipal utility districts in the nation.
If the measure fails, San Diego officials intend to refashion the local water
authority as an alternative utility hub that would construct efficient new
plants and steal business away from costlier, decades-old facilities owned by
out-of-state generators.
Some consumer advocates believe that San Diego's efforts could serve as a
model for large-scale public power systems in Northern California.
"If we can pull this off, we can bring down prices and show the way to energy
independence," said Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego. "If we don't change the
rules, we're going to be back where we were."
It won't be easy, though. Even if San Diego can overcome vigorous opposition
from power companies, its public-power scheme still could run afoul of Gov.
Gray Davis, who is counting on statewide revenue to finance next month's
municipal bond offering, the largest in U.S. history. Going its own way as a
municipal utility district would mean San Diego could avoid purchasing
electricity from the state Department of Water Resources, thus reducing the
flow of cash into California's coffers.
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said Davis would not take a
position on San Diego's public-power bill until it cleared the Legislature.
"But the governor would obviously look extremely carefully at anything that
would affect revenue to pay off the bonds," he said.
Twelve months after California's energy crisis first erupted in San Diego,
leading to statewide blackouts and financial catastrophe for utilities,
residents of this city, to a large extent, have tried to put last summer's
difficulties behind them.
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., owned by Sempra Energy, had been the first of
California's three investor-owned utilities to pay off outstanding debts and
thus qualify for a lifting of the rate freeze that accompanied deregulation
of the state's power market.
Unfortunately for San Diegans, wholesale electricity prices suddenly
skyrocketed, and San Diego Gas & Electric was free to pass along its rising
costs directly to consumers.
Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison were
still protected by the rate freeze and thus saw no changes in their power
bills -- although the two utilities, in turn, were forced to absorb about $14
billion in unrecovered expenses.
San Diego power rates subsequently were limited by state regulators to
restore stability to the local market -- but not before many residential and
business customers saw their monthly bills go through the roof.
"I'm still paying almost double what I was paying before," said George
Aguilar, owner of a downtown jewelry store. "We should talk to lawyers and
sue the people in the government responsible for this. It was pure
negligence."
WELL-INFORMED POLITICIANS
In fact, San Diego's political leaders are now among the best informed in the
nation about energy issues and the volatility of electricity markets.
When power bills spiked last year, outraged consumers demanded that their
representatives take steps to remedy the situation. Democrats and Republicans
alike took a crash course in the frequently arcane minutiae of the energy
business.
"We didn't create this problem. We didn't make any mistakes," said San Diego
Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who has been among the most aggressive local
politicians in responding to the energy mess and is a leading proponent of
the county's public-power plan.
"But one way or another, we're going to have to pay for it," she said. "This
was a very bad experiment."
Her solution is to establish a vast municipal utility that essentially would
take over the entire service area of San Diego Gas & Electric, which provides
power to 1.2 million customers.
PLANS FOR NEW POWER PLANTS
The county-run utility would build its own power plants and renewable- energy
resources and would transmit electricity to customers over existing San Diego
Gas & Electric lines. Funding for the municipal utility's activities is not
yet clear.
"There's no question in my mind that we can generate power for less than what
the generators are putting on the market," Jacob said.
REGIONAL APPROACH PRAISED
Medea Benjamin, a San Francisco consumer advocate, said the regional approach
sought by San Diego -- which requires a rewriting of state law -- would
benefit consumers by making construction of new plants more economically
feasible.
Municipal utility districts statewide are now limited to individual cities.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is one of the few large enough
to generate its own juice and sell off excess capacity.
San Francisco voters will be asked in November whether to replace the
existing San Francisco Public Utilities Commission with an independent power
and water authority.
"It would be wonderful if San Diego's disastrous experience with deregulation
results in them taking a leadership role in creation of regional public
power," Benjamin said.
Not everyone, however, backs the plan. San Diego Gas & Electric's parent,
Sempra, has actively lobbied against the public-power bill in Sacramento,
fearing that it would allow seizure of the utility's distribution system by a
county energy authority.
"It's unclear what the bill is trying to accomplish," said Art Larson, a
Sempra spokesman. "California's energy crisis isn't a local-utility problem.
It's a demand-and-supply problem."
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP CRITICIZED
Another considerable opponent of the plan is Jessie Knight, head of the San
Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce and a former member of the state Public
Utilities Commission.
He believes that public officials are no match for savvy power-industry
executives in a competitive marketplace and that the county cannot guarantee
lower rates by building its own plants.
"This thing looks like the biggest shell game in the world," Knight said.
Moreover, he said, he could not see how San Diego would win legislative
backing for regional public power when state authorities, including the
governor, were counting on revenue from all customers to back California's
multibillion-dollar bond offering.
Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido (San Diego County), author of the
public-power bill, said it was too soon for anyone to speculate about San
Diego's breaking away from the rest of the state's power grid.
"We have to be realistic about the future of this," he said. "Right now,
SDG&E is the utility in San Diego County, and there is no intent to transform
that overnight."
Meanwhile, in case Wyland's bill is defeated, a separate legislative effort
is taking shape to expand the San Diego water authority's jurisdiction to
include electricity.

13 plans submitted to alleviate power transmission bottleneck

Washington -- More than a dozen private investors have turned in proposals to
ease a Central Valley bottleneck in California's electricity transmission
grid that can contribute to blackouts in Northern California, Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday.
The 13 investment plans were in response to the Bush administration's
national energy plan, which called for the expansion of Path 15, an 84-mile
stretch of interconnected transmission lines located between Los Banos
(Merced County) and Coalinga (Fresno County). The lines form the main link
for power flows between the northern and southern parts of the state.
"When we announced our plan in May to upgrade Path 15, it was dismissed as an
old idea on which little had ever been done," Abraham said in a statement.
"Today, I am pleased to announce that those days of neglect and inaction are
over."
The administration's plan calls for $230 million in new investment from local
utilities and other private entities. Abraham called it "the first concrete
step to relieve congestion on the state's power grid."
The Bush administration, he said, "is taking a leadership role in addressing
a long-neglected problem in Caifornia's electricity transmission system."
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. owns Path 15. During the late 1980s, the utility
held public hearings in the Central Valley to discuss a possible expansion,
but dropped the plans after concluding that existing transmission lines could
handle future demand.
When California's electricity shortages began to mount last year, Path 15
proved to be a major bottleneck. By preventing an increased flow of power
from the southern to the northern parts of the state, it contributed to
blackouts in Northern California. Earlier this year, the state PUC ordered an
upgrade to the transmission system.
The federal Western Area Power Administration, which manages hydropower
projects in the Central Valley, is conducting studies for the Path 15
expansion and will be holding environmental impact hearings in Coalinga on
Aug.
27 and in Los Banos on Aug. 28. More information is available on the agency's
Web site at www.WAPA.gov <http://www.WAPA.gov>.
The agency will review the proposals and make a recommendation to Abraham.
The proposals were made by, among others, PG&E Corp., Calpine Corp. and
Mirant Corp, the Western Area Power Administration said.
The expansion plans calls for a third transmission line and other upgrades
that would permit an additional 1,500 megawatts of transmission capacity,
enough to power 1.5 million homes. Construction time is estimated at three to
four years and would cost $300 million.
The companies are expected to recapture their investment by adding a
surcharge on power transmitted over the new lines, Abraham said.
The expansion is likely to follow the same route identified in the hearings a
decade ago, running in a 2,000-foot-wide corridor through the foothills west
of Interstate 5, mainly over privately owned ranchland.
In a related development, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., hailed an agreement
between the House and Senate to spend $1.3 million for the new environmental
impact report and feasibility studies to expand Path 15. The money will go to
the Western Area Power Administration.

1037EDT0155.DTL>
(07-24) 07:37 PDT (AP) --
Developments in California's energy crisis:
TUESDAY:
* No power alerts Tuesday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
MONDAY:
* U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveils a plan to help alleviate a
transmission bottleneck that has kept power from flowing freely throughout
the state during times of peak usage. The plan calls for expanding the
state's power grid along so-called Path 15 by attracting private investment
for the $300 million project.
* A Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation has given the
full Senate a report asking for Houston-based Enron Corp. to be cited for
contempt. The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of
the Wholesale Energy Market says Enron failed to comply with a subpoena for
financial and trading documents. The Senate recessed Sunday until Aug. 20 and
could take up the matter when it returns.
* Secretary of State Bill Jones asks the state Assembly to allot $250,000 for
a legislative review into whether Gov. Gray Davis' advisers complied with
conflicts of interest laws. Jones, a Republican who plans to challenge Davis
in the next election, says the advisers failed to disclose that they held
stock in energy companies. The Senate rejected a proposal Saturday to earmark
that money for a bipartisan investigation. Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman,
says the governor's office, the attorney general and the Fair Political
Practices Commission are "working together to resolve any conflicts of
interest and to deal appropriately with any violations."
* U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali gives Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
four additional months to produce a reorganization plan in its Chapter 11
filing. PG&E lawyers had argued for the extension because of the complexity
of the case. The bankruptcy case is believed to be the largest ever.
* The Department of Water Resources says that since July 1, the state has
sold 177,571 megawatt hours at $36.95 each. During the same time, DWR
purchased 3.5 million megawatt hours of electricity at $118 per megawatt
hour. That amounts to a loss of about $14 million. Assemblyman John Campbell,
R-Irvine, says it's proof the state needs to get out of the power business.
DWR spokesman Oscar Hildalgo says it's normal for utilities to sell excess
power they have purchased.
* Shares of Edison International close at $13.67, down 57 cents. PG&E Corp.
stock close at $14.25, down 75 cents. Shares of Sempra Energy, the parent
company of San Diego Gas & Electric Co., close at $25.20, down $1.09.
* No power alerts Monday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
WHAT'S NEXT:
* The deadline for the Legislature to approve Davis' rescue deal for Southern
California Edison is Aug. 15.
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's
electricity crisis.
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost
nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E,
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state
lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and
natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are
refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power
for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The
state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas
& Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and
PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs.
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's
multibillion-dollar power buys.








Figures show state lost big on extra power
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK

Mercury News


State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month
selling surplus electricity for less than it cost.
The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a
loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much
excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts --
and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be
needed.
A Republican lawmaker
