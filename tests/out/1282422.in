I talked to Bill Newman (Southern) about this proposal yesterday.  I asked Bill if we were correct in reading the proposal to say that Southern was now open to consider the use of financial rights for transmission rather than physical rights.  He said that was correct.  I asked him if they were also willing to consider an auction as a mechanism to allocate financial rights.  He said they would consider an auction as long as they could have a way to obtain the rights needed to serve native load without driving up the cost of that service.

This is a major change in Southern's position and may open the door for resolving the major differences between the SETrans group and the Grids on congestion management functions, assuming the Grids stay with the approach that came out of the FERC mediation sessions.

I also asked Bill if he was negotiating with Entergy to form an RTO.  He said he could not confirm that officially (but confidentially- they were talking a lot more and we should see something in a couple of weeks.  He also indicated that this was the reason they were now open to the financial rights approach).

Based on the above, I think the Southern transmission pricing proposal was their attempt to gain support of the PSCs, by addressing the PSCs concerns about transmission cost increases, and to open the door to resolving the differences Southern has had with Entergy over financial vs physical transmission rights.

As far as the proposal is concerned, and the study by the Analysis Group/Economics,  there are a lot of issues we could raise with both.  The study is only valid for the specific assumptions they made (rolled in rates for all transmission and long-term sales from Henry Hub to PJM) and Southern's proposal, once again, leaves too much unspecified to know exactly what they intended.

I think we would be best served by taking the position that we welcome the study report pointing out the some of the very issues that need to be addressed in the next phase being proposed by FERC for the development of a Southeast RTO, and we are glad to note that the Analysis Group recognized that many of the issues raised could be resolved by  previous proposals to reform transmission pricing, such as the proposal to auction financial rights that Enron has been advocating.  We are also pleased to note that Southern has also recognized the use of financial rights as a viable alternative to physical transmission rights.

Please let me know if you do not agree with the above approach, and I'll give you a list of issues we could raise with the Southern proposal. But, I think we should wait a couple of weeks and see if Southern and Entergy have something put together we can address.
