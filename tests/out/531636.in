The attached comments in FERC's rulemaking proceeding on reporting
requirements for the California market are being filed today.   The comments
express our opinions that (1) permanent, formal reporting requirements are
not appropriate to address a temporary problem and that the markets are
working as they should and responding with new pipeline proposals to address
lack of capacity, (2) the Commission's powers under the Natural Gas Act to
require information are for investigatory purposes only, not for formalized,
routine reporting requirements, (3) the notice of order does not indicate how
the Comission would protect the proprietary and competitively sensitive
information it would collect, and (4) the requirements impose a significant
and undue burden on sellers of natural gas who would have to radically alter
the way they manage their business in order to provide the information in the
manner proposed.
