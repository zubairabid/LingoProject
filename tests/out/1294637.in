You should probably ask them about their status as a transmitting utility.
They should provide a related representation in the agreement.

Insofar as we are working on numerous filings, I wonder if it would be
efficient to "centralize" the process of obtaining the organizational ID
numbers with my paralegal, who, as previously noted, can get the numbers
from CT Corp.  As you know, this will cost $12 per entity, but might well
save money by streamlining the process.  Please advise.

Thank you.

Lech:

Attached please find the Collateral Annex to the Reliant Master Netting
Agreement -- didn't realize you needed to see it as well.  By this
e-mail, I am requesting that Marie coordinate with you to get you
Reliant's organizational ID number.  How do I go about confirming that
Reliant Energy Services, Inc. is not a transmitting utiltity?

Local counsel will handle the Canadian entity.

Regards,

Leslie Hansen
