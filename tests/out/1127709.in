Jerry, I received a copy of an email you addressed to Bill Brown regarding a conversation you had with Karen Choyce about who is responsible for Unclaimed Property Reporting to the States.  The Corporate Secretary Division centralized this function a few years ago and I am the person responsible for making sure that Enron Corp. and its subsidiaries stay in compliance.

I think Karen meant that it is the responsibility of each business unit to identify the unclaimed checks, move the funds to the Escheat Liability Account, communicate this information to the Corporate Secretary's Division, and reconcile the general ledger as it pertains to their business unit.

It is my responsibility to prepare the reports and remit the funds to the applicable state before the deadline.  Please forward any correspondence you receive from the States regarding this matter (including notices and forms) to my attention for further handling.  Thank you for your cooperation.
