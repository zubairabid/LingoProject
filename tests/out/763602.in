Attached is a NON BINDING letter of interest to Questar for their Southern Trail Pipeline - west leg.  This is their crude pipeline that was purchased with the intention of converting it to a natural gas line but apparently, their interests have changed.  The west leg runs from near the California border to Long Beach.
The importance of this non binding bid is to get us into the data room so that we can really take a close look and gather information to see how interested we really are in this pipe.
Please let me know if you have any comments.  This letter has gone through legal and will be faxed to Questar today.
Thanks,
Mark
