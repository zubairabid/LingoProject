In Rod's staff meeting this morning we discussed gaining access to the final performance evaluation forms so you would be able to start drafting your employee reviews.  I have attached the form below.  At this time, you can only complete evaluation forms on employees if their rating is final (Sr. Specialists and below). July 2, the PEP team will email the same form to you as well.  Call me if you have any questions 3-6609.  Thanks.
