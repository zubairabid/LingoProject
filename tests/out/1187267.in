Luiz, Orlando and Jos, Emilio: Brent, Mark and Sara will get more involved
with our energy trading activities. I believe that they can help us a lot by
sharing their experience at ECT, now that our trading activities are picking
up in Brazil. Their idea during the August visit is to be updated on what we
have been doing lately, current market, legislation and deals that we are
planning to close in the near future. Please let me know how your schedule
looks like the week of August 16. I will probably be in Buenos Aires Thursday
and Friday. To the extent  possible, I would prefer to schedule the meetings
on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thanks.
