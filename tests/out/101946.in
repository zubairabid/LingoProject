Govenrment Names

Almost 150 yrs ago, President Lincoln found it necessary to hire a private
investigator - Mr. Alan Pinkerton. The function that Pinkerton established
actually was the beginning of the Secret Service.
Since that time federal police authority has grown to a large number of
three-letter agencies - FBI, CIA, INS, IRS, DEA. Now comes a proposal for
another agency: The "Airport Security Service."  Can't you see it now, the
new service in their black outfits  with their initials in large white
letters across their backs?
