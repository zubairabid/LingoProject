This should be unit contigent power.  The way that I see this happening is that we will buy the power from Cogentrix at their bus and then sell to a Counter Party at the same bus. We will keep our share of the profit and pay Cogentrix their share.  If there is no profit then we will pay them whatever the sell goes for.  Example being:  If the Bogie is $35 and they want us to sell power and all we can get is $30, then we will pay Cogentrix $30.  There may be times where we have to procure transmission.  In this situation I see us passing through these costs to Cogentrix.  As far as the Bogie, they will tell us what the Bogie is on a day-ahead basis.
