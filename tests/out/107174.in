I want the termination provision to be included in this doc.  Let's put a date of April 13th in the draft we send to Kiodex.  I have a call in to learn about their expected close date, and in any case, we will learn from Warburg's where they are tomorrow.  I want to keep the heat on both of them to close so we can realize our value for this transaction.
