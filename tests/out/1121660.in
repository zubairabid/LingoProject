Steve, Mike and Mark,
As you know, the Corporate Responsibility group has commissioned a survey of Enron's stakeholders to gauge their opinions on corporate social responsibility and how they perceive Enron in that regard (along with comparison companies so it will not be obvious that it is Enron that has commissioned the survey.)  Lists of stakeholders to be surveyed have been compiled with the help of various corporate and business unit staff to get to a sample of 100 (50 companies,  25 government/regulators, 10 non-governmental organizations, and 15 from media, finance and academia).
The survey questionnaire is attached below.  It was written for the company respondents, with some adjustments for government, NGO and others in bold pink font.  Kelly suggested that the questionnaire would benefit from your review.  Please provide me your comments, or any questions, by Monday, September 24.
Thank you,
Catherine
