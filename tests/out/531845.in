HEADLINE: Testimony says Duke Energy actions 'unconscionably wrong'

BYLINE: By Dion Nissenbaum

BODY:

SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ A major energy company accused of gouging California
ran
one plant like a "yo-yo," scaling back the flow of electricity even as the
state
was trying desperately to find power to avert blackouts, a former plant worker
told state investigators Friday.

In a packed Capitol hearing room, former mechanic Glenn Johnson called such
actions at the Chula Vista plant run by Duke Energy "absolutely,
unconscionably
wrong."

Armed with control room logs taken from the plant, Johnson and two other
former plant workers publicly offered the special Senate committee
investigating
alleged price gouging the first inside accounts of power plant operations and
provided them with hard evidence for their ongoing investigation.

Lawmakers said they wouldn't draw conclusions until they get a chance later
this summer to hear from Duke, which leases the plant from the Port of San
Diego.

But one senator, Steve Peace, D-La Mesa, said he is already convinced that
Duke has broken its contract, which requires the plant to use "prudent
practices."

"I believe the evidence is clear that Duke has operated, and is operating in
violation of its lease," Peace said. "I believe the port can take it back."

While not given a chance to rebut the testimony at the hearing, Duke
executives dismissed the three men as misguided former workers who had small
roles in a big operation and didn't understand what they were seeing.

"This is one more page in a very long chapter of misinformation disseminated
by people who are not telling, or do not know, the full story," said Bill
Hall,
vice president of Duke's West Coast operations.

Duke did change the amount of energy it produced, Hall said. But, in
everycase, he added, the company did so at the direction of state regulators
who
oversee the ebb and flow of power.

"Duke Energy is not gouging," he said.

Senate investigators plan to match state records to the Duke logs to see if,
as the company executives argue, each decision was made at the request of
regulators. After reviewing the records Friday afternoon, the committee staff
expressed skepticism about Duke's contention that the decisions, some of them
made after midnight, were directed by state officials.

Assistant plant operator Jimmey Olkjer decoded the handwritten logs for
lawmakers, pointing out when and how Duke shifted power production. In one
case
on Jan.16, the logs show, the plant directed workers to slow production from
92
megawatts to 30 megawatts. An hour later, the state issued a Stage 3 alert
indicating power reserves were low and blackouts imminent. In the next few
hours, Duke pushed production up to 149 megawatts.

Such moves, Olkjer said before the hearing, appeared to be an effort to
manipulate the market to boost prices.

California uses complex maneuvers to make sure that it has enough power. At
times, because of congestion on transmission lines, regulators actually pay
energy companies to scale back production because they can't move it around
the
state.

But state regulators declined to comment on the allegations or the logs,
saying they are prevented from discussing specific arrangements with Duke or
other private companies. The Chula Vista plant produces enough power for about
500,000 homes. Duke has leased the plant since 1998.

Under scrutiny

Along with the state's other major power producers, Duke is under intense
scrutiny for its actions in California's dysfunctional electricity markets.
The
company is facing state and federal investigations, as well as a class-action
lawsuit.

Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who is spearheading a taxpayer lawsuit against
Duke
and other power companies for alleged price gouging, called the whistle-blower
testimony "the tip of the iceberg."

This week, federal officials again ordered Duke to refund California what
could be millions of dollars for alleged overcharges. Duke has admitted that
it
charged a record $3,880 per megawatt-hour in January for some of its power.
The
company said it provided the power at California's request as the state tried
to
head off blackouts, tacking on an 80 percent surcharge because of Pacific Gas
&
Electric Co.'s credit problems.

Executives for Duke and other power producers will head to Washington, D.C.,
next week to take part in marathon settlement talks over alleged price
gouging.
Gov. Gray Davis and other California leaders contend that the companies
overcharged the state by nearly $8.9 billion.

At the hearing, Olkjer and Johnson were joined by former mechanic Ed
Edwards.
All three worked for the plant's former operator, San Diego Gas and Electric,
and continued working during a two-year transition period when Duke took over.
They were all let go in April.

Edwards and Olkjer told the committee that they had stellar personnel
records. Johnson conceded that he was not considered a model employee because
he
sometimes complained to his union about mistreatment and spent a lot of time
off
work serving in the California National Guard.

Johnson and Edwards told lawmakers that they were directed to throw out
perfectly good spare parts to clear space in the plant. They said that
sometimes
caused delays of days or weeks in getting it back up-and-running.

Duke said it threw out the spare parts to get rid of old or obsolete
equipment.

The hearing drew sharp criticism from the state's largest independent power
producer group.

In a letter to Sen. Joe Dunn, the Garden Grove Democrat heading the
committee, the group accused lawmakers of setting aside facts in pursuit of a
media event "giving credence to the unsustainable allegations of disgruntled
employees."

"The committee is at a crossroads," wrote Jan Smutny-Jones, executive
director of the Independent Energy Producers. "It can choose to engage in
fact-finding and analysis, or it can be reduced to a witch hunt in pursuit of
headlines."

Dunn angrily challenged the characterization of his hearings and said he
plans to give Duke and other power companies plenty of time to respond in the
coming weeks.

Sen. Bill Morrow of San Juan Capistrano, the ranking Republican, agreed with
Dunn and rejected notions that the committee is a "kangaroo court."

HEADLINE: 3 new plants to generate electricity within weeks

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday that three new power plants will begin
operating within 17 days, giving California its first new major generators in
more than a decade and easing the threat of blackouts this summer.

News about the plants comes on the heels of other developments about
conservation and additional power supply that have given state officials
increasing confidence in California's ability to survive the power crisis this
summer.

''Optimistically,'' said Davis, ''our conservation and generation effort
will
help us minimize any disruptions this summer.''

One of the new plants was scheduled to begin operating in August but instead
will come on line Wednesday. Edison International's Sunrise plant near
Bakersfield will supply 320 megawatts. A megawatt can provide enough power for
750 to 1,000 households.

In addition to the Edison facility, Calpine will open its 500-megawatt
Sutter
plant near Yuba City on July 2 and its 559-megawatt Los Medanos plant near
Pittsburg 10 days later. Both plants are expected to open according to
schedule.

''In the next 17 days we will put more power on line than California did in
the last 12 years,'' Davis said.

During the past decade, the governor said, the state added less than 1,000
megawatts with a number of small power plants, despite population growth and
increased power demand from the high-tech industry.

The fast-track modernization of a 450-megawatt Huntington Beach plant is
expected by late August. The plant was shut down about five years ago.

By September, Davis said, the addition of eight to 10 small plants that
operate during peak-load periods, as well as increased power from a variety of
other small generators, will raise the total of new power coming this summer
to
4,000 megawatts.

As further protection against blackouts, state power buyers revealed last
week that in recent months they have been able to send some surplus
electricity
to a Canadian utility, BC Hydro, which will return the power in July and
August.

Despite efforts to increase the state's energy supply this summer, more
ultimately will be needed. California has been importing about 20 percent of
its
power in recent years. Even though about a dozen power plants are approved or
under construction, Davis does not expect supply to match demand until late
2003. Until then, the state will need surplus electricity generation to make
the
deregulated market work properly, experts say.

Davis has said in the past that California should add 20,000 megawatts of
power generation in the years ahead. A new state Power Authority has been
created that could construct or buy power plants if the private sector does
not
build a surplus of electricity generation.

Also, state officials suggest the trend among Californians to conserve
electricity may grow.

The state is spending $850 million on conservation programs, including
funding for energy-efficient equipment and an advertising campaign. The
program
gives refunds to customers who dramatically reduce their electricity
consumption
this summer.

State officials also expect electricity use to be reduced by ''sticker
shock'' from rate increases beginning this month for Edison and Pacific Gas
and
Electric customers. Ratepayers are exempt from the increase if they use 130
percent or less of the baseline level of electricity, a minimal amount that
varies with regional climate zones.

A proposal to increase rates for San Diego Gas & Electric customers is
pending before the state Public Utilities Commission.

In addition to announcing the new plants, Davis yesterday reiterated his
demand that California deserves $8.9 billion in refunds from overcharges by
power companies. That issue will be the subject of mediation sessions that
begin
today in Washington.

When the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed regional price limits
last week, the regulators asked an administrative law judge to recommend
possible refunds by generators for overcharging.

Davis said the California negotiating team will be led by Michael Kahn,
chairman of the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
electricity
grid.

Davis said Kahn's team will present information supporting California's
claim
of overcharging. The administrative law judge, Curtis Wagner Jr., suggested
last
week that California may be owed a smaller amount, $2 billion to $2.5 billion.

The governor sent Wagner a brief letter replying to the judge's request for
a
list of issues that should be considered in the conference.

''Our list is short,'' Davis said in the letter. ''The conference must
address the need to have FERC order power sellers to refund the estimated $8.9
billion they have overcharged the people of the State of California.''

While that session is taking place, Davis today plans to meet in Sacramento
with President Bush's two new appointees to the five-member FERC, Pat Wood III
of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania.

Davis said that when he met with the president last month, Bush agreed to
send Wood to California to investigate natural gas prices, which are several
times higher in California than in New York.

''We agreed that there is no explanation for the disparity of prices between
California and New York when it comes to natural gas,'' Davis said. ''We
agreed
that was wrong.''

The governor also said he will meet this morning with three former employees
of Duke Energy's Chula Vista power plant who have accused the company of
altering the plant's output to boost power prices.

The employees last week told a state Senate committee that they were ordered
to reduce power during peak-load periods and throw away good replacement
parts,
which sometimes delayed maintenance.

''There may be another side to the story,'' Davis said. ''But these three
employees worked 20 years, had no reason to mislead the state Senate, and they
testified under oath.''

Duke denied wrongdoing and said power was reduced at the request of the
agency that runs the power grid, the Independent System Operator.

A Davis spokesman said yesterday that he did not know if the former
employees
could qualify for a reward. In April, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer
announced a whistle-blower reward for information on price-gouging by power
generators.

Lockyer said the reward would be based on a percentage of what the state
recovers as a result of the information. He said the reward could be worth $50
million or more.

Power Regulators to Determine State Refunds;
Energy: Generators and California officials will work together for 15 days to
solve the huge mathematical problem.

BYLINE: MEGAN GARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

Starting today, federal power regulators will begin trying to solve one of
the riddles of the energy crisis: How much of a refund will California get?

One thing seems clear: The reduction will be a lot more than the
$125-million
refund ordered to date, in all likelihood soaring to more than $1 billion.

Over the next 15 days--the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is mandating
no weekends off--warring representatives from power companies and the state of
California will sit at the same table in a government conference room while a
FERC task force wrestles the question to the ground.

The task is to determine the price that power would have cost if FERC's
decision to impose soft caps had been made not last week, but last fall.

It is a daunting mathematical problem, factoring in hourly charges during
the
last eight months. To come up with a total, federal regulators, state
electricity officials and power generators must determine what the highest
price
for a megawatt should have been under the soft price caps now in effect. Then
they have to figure out which companies--if any--were charging more.

Under the recent FERC ruling, the price of electricity during any given hour
cannot exceed the actual cost of generating the least efficient--or most
expensive--power coming into the grid.

Curtis L. Wagner, the 72-year-old chief judge for FERC who is overseeing
negotiations on California's overcharges, said of this morning's events: "It
will be a zoo."

Wagner, who headed into the weekend with three inches of documents to sort
through, explained that Gov. Gray Davis wants $9 billion knocked off the
amount
the power generators charged California. "I don't really think it's that
high,"
said Wagner, predicting the refund will be more than $1 billion but probably
far
from $9 billion.

"We have folks trying to do some adding now and some work on what the number
should be," he said.

Wagner said the money at stake will be the most he has worked on in his
nearly three-decade career at the agency.

Until recently, the likelihood of massive refunds seemed nil. Although
California lawmakers--led by Davis--had demanded relief for costs that ran as
high as 10 times or more than the rates a year ago, FERC officials had not
agreed.

And their minds seemed set. When FERC first proposed remedies for the
California price increases late last year, commissioners said: "Refunds may be
an inferior remedy from a market perspective and not the fundamental solution
to
any problems occurring in California markets."

To date, FERC has ordered $125 million in refunds for alleged overcharges in
January and February.

But with the recent appointment of two new commissioners by President
Bush--Republicans Patrick H. Wood III of Texas and Nora M. Brownell of
Pennsylvania--FERC's position softened, leading to the price mitigation
ordered
last week.

Now FERC is taking a closer look at the prices already charged.

California lawmakers have pegged overcharges at nearly $9 billion since the
California market went haywire last summer--a number that comes from a study
done by Cal-ISO, the operator of California's electricity grid. Cal-ISO
officials acknowledged last week that the study might have significant flaws.

Among companies that may be required to reduce their bills are energy giants
Enron Corp., Mirant Corp., Duke Energy Corp., Williams Cos. and Reliant Energy
Inc.--all of which are expected to have representatives at the negotiations.
The
companies have hotly disputed the amount of overcharges alleged by Davis and
other California lawmakers and point out that they have yet to be paid for the
vast majority of electricity sold in the state in recent months.

Today, Wagner said he plans to make opening statements to the media. After
that, he said he hasn't determined how much of the wangling will be done
behind
closed doors. If the parties don't come to an agreement in 15 days, Wagner
will
have seven days to make a recommendation on refunds to FERC's five
commissioners.

It is a process that may be repeated down the road if Sen. Barbara Boxer
(D-Calif.) and other California politicians get their way. Boxer has
introduced
legislation that would give FERC retroactive power to order refunds--all the
way
back to July 2000, when San Diego first faced huge spikes in electricity
costs.

In the Dark, Trying to See Light at End of Crisis

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

It's dusk in the Capitol office of state Sen. Debra Bowen. Actually, it's
midafternoon. But she has the lights off to save electricity and not much sun
is
coming through a shaded window.

Her thermostat is set at 76 degrees, but it feels warmer because outside
it's
100 and she's up on the fourth floor.

There's a bright red, oversized cover framing a shiny white light switch by
the door. You can't miss it leaving the room. "That's for the people who have
trouble turning off lights," she says.

Bowen, 45, a Marina del Rey Democrat and environmental lawyer, represents
the
good side of term limits. Conscientious and cutting-edge. She replaced a
termed-out, octogenarian senator, Ralph Dills, first elected to the
Legislature
in the Great Depression.

Since coming to the Assembly in 1992, Bowen has focused on environmental
protection, foster children and high-tech--most recently trying,
unsuccessfully,
to guard the privacy of Internet consumers.

But now, like the Legislature itself, she's bogged down with an
all-consuming
issue that won't go away. The senator has been thrust into the middle of a
tangled energy mess she and other lawmakers unwittingly helped create with
their
lemming-like votes five years ago.

This time, however, Bowen is a major player as head of the Senate energy
committee.

Something must be going right, I note. We haven't had any of those rolling
blackouts everybody had predicted for June.

"My biggest concern," she replies, sitting in the twilight, "is that we're
being fooled right now because of the early snowmelt. We've got more power
than
we need."

Hydroelectric power being generated by the Sierra runoff, she explains, is
being sent to British Columbia. BC is using the California power and keeping
its
own water stored behind dams. Later in summer, as this state runs dry, BC will
generate hydro and send it to us.

Thus every kilowatt California saves today can be banked in Canada and later
withdrawn during tough times.

"I don't want people to get the idea that just because we haven't had Stage
2s or blackouts we shouldn't be concerned," Bowen says. "We're still going to
be
short power this summer. . . .

"But how do you expect Jane Citizen to figure all this out?"

Especially when Joe and Janice Legislator are having such a difficult time.

There is one vexing problem still facing the Legislature on energy. It has
passed bills promoting conservation, expediting power plant construction,
authorizing the state to sign long-term contracts for wholesale electricity,
creating a state power authority and approving bond sales to finance it all.
What's left is how--and whether--to save Southern Cal Edison from bankruptcy.

The Legislature faces an Aug. 15 deadline to approve a memo of understanding
between Gov. Gray Davis and Edison. After that, the MOU presumably goes poof
and
Edison collapses.

But the Legislature has a cocky way of ignoring and testing deadlines. Right
now there must be 100 ideas about how to handle Edison. Decision-making is
diffused. Bowen's energy committee, for example, is just one of three that is
holding Senate hearings on the Edison bailout.

"There's not much consensus," she acknowledges.

The governor's proposed Edison rescue involves state purchase of the
utility's transmission lines for about $2.8 billion. Democrats seem ambivalent
and Republicans are opposed. Long ago, the MOU was diagnosed as DOA.

Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco)--the most powerful
legislator--thinks the MOU is a giveaway to Edison.

In the Assembly, Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) has been pushing a
unique alternative he believes could also work for PG&E, now struggling in
Bankruptcy Court. Under his plan, only the "core" residential and small
business
users would be served by private utilities. Electricity would be generated by
the utilities themselves and regulated by the Public Utilities Commission.
Like
the good old days before disastrous deregulation.

The "noncore" big power users who wanted deregulation in the first place
would buy electricity directly from the generators and marketers, presumably
at
a savings. "They're the ones who brought this on us," Hertzberg says.

But, he adds, "there's a billion moving parts" and they're not fitting well.
For one, there may not be enough power to buy directly now that the state has
cornered so much in long-term contracts.

Bowen is one of the better ones. But not even she is sure what the
Legislature's next step should be. "We don't have a lot of room to move," she
says.

Nor a lot of time. If Edison goes bankrupt, it truly will be a dark day in
the Capitol.

HEADLINE: Demand Had Minor Role in Power Crisis;
Electricity: Consumption has been predictable, and rose less quickly than in
other Western states. But supply grew hardly at all, and reserves melted away.

BYLINE: ROBIN FIELDS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

California has been depicted as a power addict whose growing habit led
inexorably to the crisis that has roiled the state since May 2000.

Yet the state's electricity yen is the wrong target for blame--the least
volatile and least decisive piece of a larger puzzle, an analysis of
consumption
patterns shows.

California consumption has been as regular as a heartbeat in the last
decade,
sloping upward gently with a blip each summer. In the last year, demand's
predictability made it the lone calm spot within a hailstorm of dizzying price
peaks and supply lurches.

Moreover, California's power consumption increased far less than that of its
Western neighbors, on whose excess supply it had come to depend.

"Yes, demand grew in California, but what people who have that discussion
ignore is that demand in the rest of the West grew even faster," said Severin
Borenstein, director of the UC Energy Institute in Berkeley. "We're all part
of
the same grid."

Within the complex, sometimes murky power picture, demand was a problem
hiding in plain sight.

Starting in 1998, energy agencies began to warn that its slow swell, coupled
with stagnant supply, had left California with wafer-thin power reserves. In
retrospect, these agencies say, deregulation left them powerless to prevent
the
impending collision between supply and demand.

When they hit head-on last summer, the amount of power used day to day by
Californians often had no relationship to the periods when the state
experienced
blackouts or the highest wholesale prices, analysts said.

In the last 10 years, California's power consumption has moved subtly, never
advancing more than 3.7% a year and, even at its height, lagging behind such
other measures as job growth and economic output.

In the early 1990s, recession savaged heavy-duty power users, ranging from
manufacturers to agricultural interests to the aerospace industry. The
industrial sector's usage actually declined from 1990 to 1995.

Overall, consumption inched up so slowly in the decade's first half--just
1.3%--that demand was of little concern as policymakers assembled the
mechanisms
of deregulation, current and former industry officials say.

The system's reserve cushion--the extra supply available at peak times--was
estimated in 1993 at a robust 12% to 14.5%, without a single electron imported
from beyond California's borders. With pressure off, utilities shifted
resources
out of programs promoting conservation and redistributing peak-hour
consumption.
Instead, they focused on new technologies that had little immediate payoff.

"There was less emphasis on demand management," said Barbara Barkovitch, an
Oakland-based consultant who served on the California Independent System
Operator's board from its formation in 1998 until last June. "There was
nothing
nefarious about it, but people always assume the future will be like the
present."

As the economy rebounded, consumption growth averaged about 3% a year. That
slight escalation--which fell within the expectations of forecasters at the
California Energy Commission--took on out-sized significance because it
occurred
as supply stagnated.

"The problem was not one of demand in isolation, but that our demand kept
growing steadily, supply did not grow much at all, and the gap just shrank
progressively," said Ahmad Faruqui, the Palo Alto-based Electric Power
Research
Institute's area manager for retail and power markets.

Regionally, the expansion was uneven, weighted toward the fast-developing
San
Diego area and Northern California's tech corridor. Consumption in San Diego
Gas
& Electric's service area rose more than 17% from 1995 to 2000 and, for the
decade, increased almost twice as much as in the state overall.

The commercial sector's usage grew twice as fast in the decade's last five
years as it had in its first half as the economic mix shifted toward services
and offices loaded up on energy-eating technology.

The heady affluence of the late '90s also inflated residential consumption.

Consumers splurged on bigger houses, pools and spas, more appliances and
up-to-the-minute gadgetry, said Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area
Economic Forum. Fixed retail prices meant consumers had little incentive to
rein
themselves in, analysts said.

"We decided we were not going to have a process for adjustment on the demand
side," Borenstein said. "We relied entirely on the supply side and that turned
out to be a huge mistake."

Still, even as consumption grew, businesses became more efficient. Measured
per capita, California's consumption remained modest compared to that of less
efficient, more weather-intensive states.

But gradually and quietly, the system's reserve margin shrank to 4% by 1998,
a third or less than they had been at their fattest. Even that depended
heavily
on seasonal help from the other states that share California's grid, help they
were increasingly less able to give.

Electricity consumption in Arizona, Colorado and Utah grew at about twice
California's rate from 1988 to 1998. It expanded three times as fast in
Nevada.
In these states, too, supply did not keep up.

The collapse that started in May 2000 could have begun a year earlier if not
for cool weather and plentiful rain, yielding cascades of Pacific Northwest
hydroelectric power.

At least six state, regional and federal energy agencies issued reports from
late 1998 to early 2000 warning that California's reserve margin had
shriveled,
that help from other Western states might decrease, and that the state was one
hot summer away from disaster.

"The Arizona-New Mexico-Southern Nevada and the California-Mexico areas of
[the Western transmission grid] may not have adequate resources to
accommodate a
widespread severe heat wave or a higher-than-normal forced outage rate for
generation," wrote the North American Electric Reliability Council in its June
1999 summer assessment. "Those areas are experiencing a continuing trend of
peak
demand growth exceeding the addition of new generation facilities."

But in the deregulated system, regulators no longer had a decisive hand in
balancing supply and demand. Officials at the California Energy Commission say
even analyzing the situation became harder as utilities became less methodical
in submitting their consumption data.

"Things got sloppier," said Michael Jaske, the commission's chief forecaster
since 1980. "The utilities started letting that stuff slide, poorer data was
coming in to us, and our management wasn't going after them the same way."

Marketplace incentives were supposed to replace government control, but new
supply did not materialize even though rising demand had created a clear-cut
opportunity.

Private generators say the system's uncertainties, plus California's
environmental fervor and slow regulatory process, prevented the market from
working. Borenstein's assessment is blunt: "The reason that no one built power
plants was that no one thought you could make money at it."

Ultimately, the flurry of studies predicting an oncoming crisis circulated
among regulators and power industry insiders, but prompted little urgency when
it came to curtailing demand. The Davis administration focused on supply
instead, taking steps to expedite the approval process for power plants, Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio said.

"Hindsight is always 20-20," he said. "We weren't having blackouts in '99,
so
it didn't pop up on anyone's radar."

Summer 2000 took care of that, hitting like a sonic boom.

Hot weather caused consumption to jump almost 4% year-over-year, double the
decade-long average. Peak demand from May through August was consistently
about
10% higher than in summer 1999, averaging an extra 3,200 megawatts per
day--enough to power more than 3 million homes.

On Aug. 16, the day with the year's highest peak, Cal-ISO's so-called
spinning reserve--the amount of capacity that can be brought on line within 10
minutes--was 1.2%.

The causal link between heightened usage and other pressure signals, from
higher spot-market prices to staged emergencies, seemed clear.

Or was it? Peak demand still fluctuated within a narrow range only
marginally
above long-standing forecasts. The so-called superpeak--the moment of highest
usage on summer's most brutal day--was lower than in uneventful 1999.

Moreover, after summer's heat ebbed, California's consumption tapered.
Still,
the power crisis' other symptoms raged on.

In November and December, wholesale power prices soared, California paid far
more for natural gas than the rest of the nation, and the first rolling
blackouts hit. Yet peak demand traced an almost identical line as it had the
year before, averaging a few megawatts less.

Peak demand was down again from January to April when rolling blackouts
returned, averaging about 1,600 megawatts less than in the same stretch of
2000,
which passed without a single emergency.

State officials were quick to blame suppliers, but many industry analysts
point to the region-wide supply-demand equation.

These forces may continue to dominate, they acknowledge, even though
Californians have cut back on consumption faster and more this year than state
officials had dared to hope.

In May, peak demand dropped 10.4% below its 2000 level and consumption fell
11%, marking the fifth straight month of reductions.



Electricity Demand

Electricity use in California has shown no dramatic shifts over the last
several years, increasing at an average of about 2% a year. In the last year,
its predictability has stood in stark contrast to the gyrations of supply and
wholesale prices. Total consumption of electricity in the state, in thousands
of
gigawatt-hours:

HEADLINE: Pending Power Plants in California Face Some Problems

BYLINE: By Steve Johnson

BODY:


SAN JOSE, Calif.--Although California's summer energy outlook seems to be
brightening, state leaders still are counting on new power plants to boost
competition and lower electricity prices in years to come.

They may end up disappointed.

Even with 42 new power plants in the works before the California Energy
Commission as of early last week, the state can't be sure of how much power
they
will produce or what prices they will charge, experts say. That could prove
troublesome, since 70 percent of the power the state plans to buy through
long-term contracts is supposed to come from these new plants.

Nor is there any guarantee of the price these plants might charge for the
rest of their power on the spot market, despite last Monday's order by federal
regulators to generally limit spot prices across the West.

Like much of what has happened since the state passed deregulation, the
future appears cloudy. Here's why:

-- Critics say the price caps ordered Monday by the Federal Energy
Regulatory
Commission contain loopholes that could allow California's electricity costs
to
soar on days when it is desperate for power. And when the Mercury News asked
12
of the companies involved in the recently approved or pending power plants if
they could promise that their spot market prices would be cheaper than what
California has been paying recently, none could.

-- Of the 25 mostly private entities involved in these new power plant
projects, only six are generators new to the state, and most of their plants
are
relatively small. That may slow the development of a more competitive
electricity market, which state officials say is needed to lower prices.

-- More than a third of the electricity to be produced by these new
operations would be controlled by firms accused in recent lawsuits or
governmental actions of questionable pricing and, in some cases, outright
gouging. State officials claim that some of these companies, among other
things,
have shut down their plants when electricity demand was high to artificially
crimp supplies and inflate prices.

-- Some experts doubt that all of the proposed plants will get built.
Several
power companies acknowledged that the intense criticism of them by California
officials and uncertainties over the economic viability of owning plants here
could cause them to delay or even abandon their projects. Others suspect these
firms eventually may cancel some of the plants they have proposed, to keep
power
in short supply and prices high.

"I'm concerned," said California Public Utilities Commissioner Carl Wood,
when asked about the makeup of the firms proposing the new plants. "It's the
same cartel. We will have more generation, but we will have the same players
owning and controlling it."

Such comments irk power suppliers, who have repeatedly denied breaking any
laws or regulations governing the sale of wholesale electricity. Many of these
entrepreneurs find it particularly galling that the very state officials
accusing them of price gouging are begging them to build plants in
California.

Few politicians have been as vehement in their denunciation of electricity
suppliers as Gov. Gray Davis. Yet he is among those relying heavily on the new
power plants these companies are developing to help pull California out of its
energy crisis.

"Eventually when supply and demand come back into something approaching
balance, there will be genuine price competition," Davis said in December. He
repeated the point earlier this month, proclaiming that "by the fall of 2003,
we
will have more power than we need. That will solve the long-term problem."

Davis isn't alone. Although power costs have fallen in recent weeks and
federal officials may impose tougher price controls on electricity, the
assumption that more plants is the key to solving California's troubles is
taken
as gospel by many state and federal officials.

It seems logical enough. More power presumably would not only ease the
threat
of blackouts, but relieve California of the need to pay exorbitant prices on
days when electricity is in short supply.

But calculating how much more power the state will wind up with, based on
how
many plants are on the drawing board, is risky, say some state regulators and
consumer advocates.

"I have no confidence at the moment that a majority of those new plants will
ever materialize," because power companies are likely to maintain an
electricity
shortage to keep prices high, said Michael Shames, of the Utility Consumers
Action Network. "Why would they want to change what they've got? They've got a
sweet deal."

Another reason plants might not get built is politics. Several firms with
projects in the works claimed that threats by state officials to seize their
plants or impose a windfall profits tax on their sales had made it harder to
obtain financing.

"Every time these politicians start spouting off to improve their own
political careers, they don't realize the damage they're doing," said Gary
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum.

Just this month, Mirant Corp. of Atlanta received state permission to build
a
530 megawatt plant in Contra Costa County -- enough to supply power to about
400,000 homes -- and it has applied to build a similarly-sized generator in
San
Francisco. But its spokesman Chuck Griffin said both projects are on hold,
until
Mirant feels more comfortable about the state's political and economic
climate.

"We have to be able to determine that it's going to be a viable investment,"
he said.

Even if all 42 plants are built, many of the companies proposing them were
skittish about promising cheaper prices. They said it depends on such things
as
the future cost of natural gas, which many of their plants use for fuel.

One firm California is counting on is Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which
already commands a modest fleet of small plants in the state and is developing
nearly one fourth of the 42 new plants.

Although Calpine has earned huge profits in recent months, it has a
relatively good reputation among consumer advocates and state investigators
who
have reviewed its confidential power sales data. Moreover, Calpine's name is
conspicuously absent from recent lawsuits and federal legal filings that have
either accused other firms of gouging or questioned the reasonableness of
their
prices.

Much of the power to be generated from Calpine's new plants will be sold in
long-term contracts to the state, according to company spokesman Bill
Highlander. But like other suppliers, he was vague about what it would charge
for the rest.

"It kind of depends on a whole number of factors," Highlander said,
including
how much people conserve and how much power California can continue importing
from other states. Since no one can predict such things today, he added,
"that's
what makes it so difficult."

If anyone should be concerned about the price of power it's the folks at
PG&E
Corp., who have blamed high electricity costs for forcing their utility --
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. -- into bankruptcy. But even they wouldn't
speculate
about how much they would charge for the power from their 1,048 megawatt plant
in Kern County, which is to be built by their unregulated affiliate, PG&E
National Energy Group. PG&E's energy trading arm is among the suppliers
accused
of questionable pricing practices, although PG&E officials have denied any
wrongdoing.

By the time the Kern County plant is done in two years, "if we have a
situation where we are seeing a lot more generation come on line in the state,
economic law should dictate that prices will come down," said PG&E Corp.
spokesman Greg Pruett. But that's not for certain, he said, adding, "we've all
gone to school about how topsy-turvy the market could become."

Like every other generator, PG&E doesn't plan to spend a lot of money
building a plant just to wind up giving away its electricity. "Obviously,"
Pruett said, "everyone who invests in these is doing so to earn a profit."

$9 billion showdown over power;

State delegation seeking refunds

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writers

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill, Christian Berthelsen

BODY:
A critical showdown in California's energy crisis starts this morning, as
state
officials meet with energy companies to demand $9 billion in refunds.

A 15-day settlement conference, ordered as part of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission's decision last week to put price controls on wholesale
electricity prices, will bring together the parties that have been squabbling
for the past year.

"We are going to Washington with one goal, and that is to bring back $9
billion," Gov. Gray Davis told reporters yesterday. "The fact is that people
have taken advantage of the market, gamed the system and ripped people off."

But Davis' crusade may be dampened by challenges to the study the state
used
to arrive at the $9 billion figure and by a FERC mediator's prediction that
California will walk away with less than it is demanding.

The Democratic governor's figure is based on an update of a March study by
the California Independent System Operator, which manages the sate's power
grid.
Some energy experts argue the study is flawed, but the ISO stood firm behind
its
methodology yesterday.

Curtis L. Wagner Jr., the FERC administrative law judge who will oversee
the
meeting, said in an interview with The Chronicle yesterday that he was
optimistic a settlement would be reached.

Wagner said the $9 billion "seems a little high. And the generators'
numbers
seem low. We'll probably come out somewhere in between."

The veteran mediator, who spent yesterday reviewing spreadsheets submitted
by the parties, said he will look at applying last week's commission price
control order back to October.

"I think we should put the refund issue to rest," Wagner said. "I'm sure we
can agree on a structure that is fair to everybody." Enron Corp, Reliant
Energy
Inc., Duke Energy Corp., Williams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Mirant Corp. are among
the companies facing allegations of illegally overcharging California. The
companies say the high prices were a result of the high costs of natural gas
used to generate power.

"There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone," said
Mark Stultz, a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association, which
represent the generators.

But Davis insisted that the state will recover the full amount it is
asking.

"Under the law, FERC has no discretion," he said. "It is mandated to refund
excessive charges, if prices were found to be unjust and unreasonable, which
they were."

The governor, however, acknowledged that some of the money he is demanding
may be owed by municipal utilities that do not fall under FERC's jurisdiction.

Davis adviser Nancy McFadden said municipal utilities such as Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power and BC Hydro that sold electricity to the state
have been invited to join the talks as well.

"We need the FERC to lay the basis to seek refunds from private generators,
and use that as a basis to seek refunds from public generators," she said.

California could face an obstacle in its case for the full repayment it
seeks. Under FERC rules, overcharges can only be authorized after a formal
investigation is ordered, which in this case started on Oct. 2, 2000. If
Wagner
sticks to that time frame, it eliminates the summer 2000 months when prices
first began to spike.

"There is no question we can order refund from that (October) date
forward,"
Wagner said. "Legally, there may be some question before that date."

But Wagner said a FERC regulations may not necessarily rule out broader
refunds. "That's the great thing about a settlement -- you can do anything,"
he
said.

If no settlement is reached in 15 days, Wagner will forward his
recommendations to the full commission for its approval. California will then
have the option of pursuing the matter further in court.

California's delegation will be led by Michael Kahn, a San Francisco lawyer
who chairs the ISO.

Davis also meets today in Sacramento with new FERC Commissioners Patrick
Wood and Nora Brownell to discuss the refunds and the high cost of natural gas
in the state.

Wood, who is expected to be named chairman of the commission in the fall,
has expressed his support for finding solutions to California's power
woes.E-mail the reporters at lgledhill@sfchronicle.com and

HEADLINE: BECHTEL HOLDS ITS OWN;

Despite economic downturn, S.F. construction giant's revenues remain steady

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Todd Wallack

BODY:
The economy is skidding. Tech firms are shutting plants and reining in
expansion
plans. And two major engineering and construction firms, Stone & Webster and
Washington Group (formerly Morrison Knudsen) sought bankruptcy protection
during
the past 13 months.

So, it would come as no surprise to hear that the world's largest
engineering and construction firm, San Francisco's Bechtel Group, is getting
pinched by the downturn.

Only it isn't.

Despite the slowdown in the economy and in some areas of construction,
Bechtel and many rivals are still busy upgrading cellular networks, building
railroads and airports, and completing new power plants.

"Our guys are working 80 to 100 hours a week completing deals," said John
Siegel, vice president of marketing and strategy for Bechtel's power plant
construction division. "You walk around at 9 p.m. and everyone is still here."

Overall, Bechtel's sales dipped 5 percent last year to $14.3 billion, but
that's still up 13 percent from 1999 and a healthy 74 percent from 1996. The
company said operating margins improved last year. And employment jumped by a
quarter during the past five years to 41,000 worldwide, including 1,300 in San
Francisco. Both employment and sales are holding firm so far this year. (The
privately held firm doesn't release earnings figures.)

Bechtel isn't alone. Shares in Fluor, the second-largest engineering and
construction firm, and Jacobs Engineering Group nearly doubled in value during
the past 12 months. And some analysts are bullish on the future.

"We could be on the front end of a multiyear up-cycle," Merrill Lynch
analyst Fritz von Carp predicts.

CONTRARY CYCLES

Although the engineering and construction industry has long been vulnerable
to sharp downturns, von Carp said the cycles often differ from the rest of the
U.S. economy.

For instance, high energy prices usually spell bad news for most domestic
businesses. But an energy shortage could help spur a boom in new power plants,
refineries and pipelines -- lifting the petroleum sector out of a decade-old
funk. That has long been a major business for firms such as Bechtel.

In addition, von Carp points out that government agencies typically garner
a
large share of transportation revenue from gasoline taxes -- which aren't as
sensitive to downturns as income taxes and capital gains. California and other
states have also increasingly walled off those funds, so politicians can't
raid
the transportation war chests to pay other bills when budgets are tight.

Government agencies and big businesses also tend to initiate major projects
when times are good. But because the projects often take years to start and
complete, they often wind up ramping up after the economy has already slid
into
recession. "It is really a late cycle," von Carp said.

This isn't to say that Bechtel's business is humming across the board.

Bechtel Executive Vice President Jude Laspa said sales remain lackluster in
its mining and chemical division. (And despite von Carp's predictions of an
upswing in the petroleum industry, Laspa said sales haven't picked up so far.)

"We have some very robust businesses, and some that are in a cyclical
downturn," Laspa said.

TIGHT MARGINS

Engineering and construction companies also have to be content with lower
profit margins than those in many other industries. Like its rivals, Bechtel
typically pockets about 3 to 5 percent of revenues after taxes, Laspa said.
Operating margins are closer to 7 to 9 percent. (By contrast, anything under
20
percent is considered anemic in the newspaper industry.)

"This is a low-margin business," von Carp said.

Industry players are also increasingly taking on more risk, bidding on
fixed-price contracts to compete. In the past, many firms charged by the hour
and profits soared when projects became mired in delays. Now that companies
are
getting only a lump sum for a development, major setbacks in a project or two
could sink a firm.

Stone & Webster of Boston, for instance, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection last year, largely because of delays in building a gas-fired power
plant in Tiverton, R.I. Shaw Group later acquired most of the firm's assets.

Meanwhile, Washington Group of Boise, Idaho, foundered after it acquired
Raytheon's Engineers and Constructors unit, igniting a nasty court battle.
Washington accused Raytheon of concealing problems with several of the
projects
and demanded compensation; Raytheon blamed Washington for mismanaging the
projects and insisted it owed nothing.

Although Bechtel doesn't let outsiders review its books, analysts say they
believe the firm has largely avoided such problems and is financially solid.
Bechtel executives point out that the company is 50 percent larger than its
next-biggest competitor.

"Bechtel is considered in the industry to be the pre-eminent engineering
and
construction company," von Carp said. "It is a very good competitor with a
strong franchise in many markets."

ON TOP IN TELECOM

Bechtel has also enjoyed some luck lately.

For instance, some telecommunications equipment firms are doing so poorly
that one analyst compared it to a "nuclear winter." Dozens of data service
providers, such as NorthPoint Communications in Emeryville, have shut down.
Others have severely reined in their expansion plans.

But Bechtel's revenues are up 20 to 25 percent this year. George Conniff,
president of Bechtel's telecommunications and industrial business unit, said
his
firm mainly serves financially solid firms, such as AT&T Wireless, which are
still going ahead with plans to add 8,000 new towers, despite the slowdown. He
also said the unit has picked up some consulting business abandoned by
equipment
firms trying to narrow their focus to weather the downturn.

"We're having a great year," Conniff said. "When the river is muddy, the
fish start to bite."

But no part of the business is doing as well as Bechtel Power.

A POWERHOUSE IN ENERGY

"The power business is doing spectacular," von Carp said. "It is the
strongest part of the market now, bar none."

Siegel said the company has 22 plants under construction worldwide -- up
from about nine four years ago -- and many more in the pipeline, particularly
in
the United States. Siegel said the unit's revenue rose 15 to 20 percent last
year and is on pace to match that this year. He said the firm could probably
land even more business if it had the ability to pursue and handle more
projects.

Through another unit, Bechtel is also investing in power plants under
development in Hayward, Pittsburg and San Jose. The company struck a deal with
San Jose's Calpine in 1998 to spend $1 billion building several plants in the
Bay Area. Under the deal, the companies will jointly own the plants and split
the profits down the middle. Because of the strong demand for electricity in
California, Bechtel spokesman Jeff Leichtman said it will probably wind up
spending at least $500 million more than originally announced.

Bechtel doesn't own any existing plants in the United States, so it isn't
among those accused of gouging consumers in the recent energy crisis. But
that's
partly an accident of fate.

The firm's investment arm teamed with PG&E in the late '80s to start
building plants. But in 1996, PG&E offered to buy out Bechtel for most of the
U.S. operations; Bechtel sold the rest of its U.S. stakes shortly thereafter.

But Bechtel kept the shares in its overseas plants and bought out PG&E a
year later. Bechtel now operates the foreign plants through a division called
Intergen. It also owns more than half of Nexant, an energy consulting firm
based
in San Francisco.

Now, at a time when many Bay Area firms are being hurt by the energy
crisis,
Bechtel stands to cash in.

And Laspa said word is already leaking out. He said the firm is getting
inundated by resumes. "Potential employees know where the business is strong,"
he said.

HEADLINE: Price cap perils . . . and peripatetics

BYLINE: Donald Lambro; THE WASHINGTON TIMES

BODY:

Republican Whip Tom DeLay couldn't believe what he was hearing at a House
Republican leadership meeting last week after the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission voted to put into place stricter controls on Western electricity
prices.

Almost all of the Republican leaders around the table, who were opposed to
price caps, were happy with FERC's decision because it pulled the political
rug
out from under the Democrats. "The mood around the table was positive. FERC
had robbed the Democrats of a big issue - that we were doing nothing to
control
higher energy prices for consumers," said a Republican House leadership
official
who attended the meeting.

The independent regulatory agency's decision did what President Bush and
Republican leaders had publicly fought but were privately encouraging FERC to
do. While Republican leaders do not believe the price controls will alleviate
California's energy shortage, they were delighted by its immediate political
result. It pricked the price-cap balloon that had been rapidly growing on
Capitol Hill. Price-control Democrats, among them Sen. Dianne Feinstein of
California, have withdrawn their price-cap bills while they wait to see if the
agency's action will work.

The administration, which said for months that price controls would only
exacerbate California's energy problems, was nevertheless happy to see the
Democratic offensive collapse. Under advice from political strategist Karl
Rove, Mr. Bush embraced FERC's action, maintaining that it did not impose
price
controls, although everyone knows that is exactly what it did.

Mr. DeLay was not buying the party line, and said so. While he did not
directly criticize the White House's acquiescence - or its behind-the-scenes
lobbying for FERC's action - he put out a strong statement reminding his party
that price controls cannot and will not work.

"Let's be clear," he said. "In every place they've been tried,
big-government price controls have failed to achieve the results their
supporters promised. They failed when Republicans used them. And they failed
when Democratic presidents used them. All government price controls can offer
is the specter of longer and more frequent blackouts."

"The people of California are suffering today because the demand for
electricity exceeds the available supply. Until that fundamental imbalance is
resolved, their problems will continue," he said.

Mr. Bush argued that FERC's order "was not talking about firm price
controls. . . . They're talking about a mechanism to mitigate any severe
price
spike that may occur, which is completely different from price controls."

To which Wall Street economist and columnist Larry Kudlow replied, "Huh?
You
can't be just a little bit pregnant. It's an administration endorsement of
the
FERC ruling. Maybe a soft endorsement, but an endorsement nonetheless."

Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham's support for FERC's price-control action,
reported in my last column, sounded as if it were "right out of the old East
Bloc planning handbook before the Berlin Wall came down," Mr. Kudlow said in
his
column.

Despite Mr. Bush's embrace of what the White House considers
"regulation-lite," there is widespread unanimity across the political spectrum
that energy price controls will fail.

Listen to what economist Robert Litan of the liberal Brookings Institution
said about them: "Ninety-five percent of economists would say that price
controls are always dumb or that that there should be a very strong
presumption
against price controls. They lead to artificial scarcity and then perpetuate
it."

Richard Nixon imposed price controls on oil in the 1970s to lower gas prices
at the pump, with disastrous results.

The artificially low prices did not reduce consumption, they encouraged it.
They did not lead to more production and supply, they led to less. The price
ceilings "removed incentives for producers to increase supply through less
