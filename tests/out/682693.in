eProcurement

Last week, Global Strategic Sourcing announced an agreement with SkyTel Communications to provide special discount incentives on pagers and Blackberry handheld devices.  These items and service plans are available in the iBuyit eProcurement catalog.  This update focuses on using eProcurement to order these devices.

Locating SkyTel/Blackberry Items in the eProcurement Catalog
Pagers and Accompanying Service Plans:
*  Corporate eProcurement users should go to the catalog under Office Supplies.  Then enter Skytel pagers as the Quick Search text.
Tip: All users must select a service plan in addition to the pager.
Handheld Devices:
*  Corporate eProcurement users should go to the catalog under IT Hardware.  Then enter Blackberry as the Quick Search text.
Tip:  No need to select a separate service plan.  A service plan is combined in the catalog with each handheld device.

Information Required When Ordering SkyTel Items
Pagers and Handheld Devices:  The user's EID and name are required for all SkyTel items.  After adding the item(s) to the Shopping Cart, the requester must click the Line Item Details icon (magnifying glass) and enter the user's EID and name under the Purchase Order Text tab.  The order cannot be processed without this information. This will ensure that the ongoing monthly service plan charges are assigned correctly to the user's cost center.
Tip:  If you wish to swap out a pager for a handheld device, make sure to include your existing pager phone number in the PO Text.
Did you know?:  If EID is unknown, user should go to eHRonline to view their EID.
