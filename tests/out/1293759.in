Yesterday SoCal filed the attached Advice Letter No. 2837-A to implement revised operating procedures under Rule 30 of their tariff.  Basically this will formalize the October announcement to discontinue the Windowing process calculations effective November 1, 2001.  Instead SoCal will utilize the Maximum Operating Capacity at each receipt point as the capacity limit.  Lynn attended the referenced October meeting and subsequently distributed the handouts which are also part of the attachment, however if anyone needs additional copies of  them please let me know. SoCal views this filing as an interim step towards approval of the GIR/Unbundling proceeding which will provide for a system of firm tradable intrastate transmission rights.  I'll continue to monitor the proceeding and will advise of any further actions taken by SoCal or their customers.  gh
