I am pleased to send you the Mid-September 2001 web-based e-mail "Alert"
prepared by Baker & McKenzie's Global Labour, Employment & Employee Benefits
Practice Group ("GLEEB"). The Alert's purpose is to provide our clients and
friends with timely updates in a short "user friendly" fashion with
hyperlinks to articles with more detailed information on employment law
developments from around the world. The Alert is organized into six sections
- Global, Asia Pacific, Europe, Africa/Middle East, South America, and North
America. The Alert consists of short, one-paragraph "blurbs," organized by
country and region. You can quickly scan the Alert for items of particular
interest, and then click on the hyperlinks provided for each blurb for
additional information.

If you would like to be removed from my mailing list for the Baker &
McKenzie Global Employment Law Alert, please type "REMOVE" in the subject
line in a return email to me and I will take you off my email list.

Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions.

in providing privacy protections and disclosures. See " Privacy Foundation
