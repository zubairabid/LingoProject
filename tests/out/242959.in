I'm forwarding ECT Canada's top 15 counterparties. We will use this list with
the exception of J. Aaron, BP Amoco, PG&E, Morgan Stanley and Bank of
Montreal as our target list for the USD/CAD products. Please ensure that a
GTC is drawn up to allow EOL trading of these currency products. I would like
to have the legal work done by March 6 in order to meet Gary's deadline.
David: I talked to Goldman today. They have developed a mechanism to feed
live rates from their website into Excel. They will be here in 2 weeks to do
a demo.
