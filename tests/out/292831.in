Dave:

As you and I discussed, Jake and I are focusing on quickly contacting the key U.S. banks in the FX space to assess their interest in posting foreign exchange products on EnronOnline, similar to your earlier recent work with several Canadian banks.  The attached list describes the key US-based FX prospects we'll be contacting during the next several days.

We also will be contacting other financial institutions regarding other products, such as interest rate swaps, corporate bond trading, and other ideas.  However, I wanted to quickly get the FX groups of these banks up to speed in order to parallel the progress on the Canadian banks.

Please let me know if you have comments or questions.

Thanks,

Mike
