Since no one in your group could locate these guys either, I suggest that you have this type of information in RAC for every authorized signatory and their back-ups. This information needs to be available and communicated to all folks that are responsible for DASH signatures. If there is ever another situation where people are not available at any given time to sign a DASH, I want RAC to have a back-up plan in place. I'm holding RAC responsible for ensuring this process works. Once this DASH process has been fully vetted-including adding Whalley and Frevert, and the back-up plan in place- I want to have your folks working with EES and our Deal Management leads in a room to review the process and ensure everyone understands it.
