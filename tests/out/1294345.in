Dear Corporate Partner,

It's time for another J.Crew corporate event! (and just in time for
your holiday shopping.) From November 14th-18th, 2001, you and the
members of your company are invited to take 20% off everything in our
stores and online at jcrew.com. You missed our last event? Or you love
all our great new styles for yourself and everyone on your gift-giving
list? Here's your opportunity to get them: in our stores and at jcrew.com,
you'll find the season's best...and by clicking below, you'll find
that extra little incentive, too.

To find your invitation, please visit the following URL, that you
should forward to your colleagues.

Here's the fine print: To receive the 20% discount, your employees can
simply print the email/invite (please remember that you must have it in
order to receive the discount) and present it to the cashier at any of
our stores. Or, if they prefer to receive their discount online at
jcrew.com, they can simply enter the word "CORP1101" in the "redeem
coupon" box on the first checkout page. Please note that this discount
does not apply to online clearance items, or in our catalog.

Thank you so much for acting as the corporate contact for this event.
We hope that you and your colleagues will take advantage of this
invitation. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me
directly, either by email (garbarin@jcrew.com) or at (212) 209-8301.

Best regards,

Stephanie Garbarini
