ENW EBS IT -  Weekly Status Report  (as of 10/26/01)


Executive Summary :

EnFiber:   Real Estate Book requirements gathering and documentation is 100% complete; obtained all approvals; development is 25% complete.  User acceptance testing for Scheduling Phase 1 is 85% complete; the implementation date has been changed to 10/26 per user's request.  Waiting for final signoff from Jim Terrell. Successfully implemented FACT Release 1.2 on 10/15.  Completed development of IP and Local Loop options for Valuation and began QA testing.

PPCS/TRPS:
TRP demo by Dorado is well accepted by Enron audience. The prototype is able to fix the biggest problem in the current EBS bandwidth trading process -- not able to show the actual hardware inventory of network elements in order to make accurate port striping and cross connect. Through their auto hardware discovery device driver, switch inventory will be presented clearly to the users in a nice graphical layout, so provisioners don't have to spend huge amount of time to maintain various IT systems to gather the knowledge of bandwidth capacity allocation.  TRPS will gather information for both TDM and IP.
Settlements (Saber):  Users are approximately 50% complete with User Acceptance Testing.  Users were successful in posting first invoices to SAP with no errors.  A demo of the GUI for the Flash to Actuals reconciliation process is scheduled for Monday, Oct. 29.  Production Implementation will be mid-to-late November,  a couple weeks ahead of original schedule.
Remedy:  Started discussions for release 2.0 of the EBS Change Management application.   Changes to include schedule maintenance notices and test & turnup.  These changes does not require mandatory approval. Added automatic reporting functionality to the EBS Trouble Ticketing system.  Continued web development on the MSN document routing and approval system.   Functionalities completed include submitting new request, approvals and comments.
Livelink thespotlight: is currently providing storage for 24606 documents. Currently work is in progress to incorporate Engineering and Operations documents into the system, as well as migrate the system into the Corp domain. Below is a more detailed description of this week's activities and next week's deliverables.
EBS Application Infrastructure:  Provide oversight and project management activities of the EBS application infrastructure with ENW.

EBS Database Technologies:   Provide on-going production and development database support for both external and internal EBS database systems.

Utopia: The proof of concept was completed Sept. 21st. A demo has now been given to Rick Paiste, Inja Chun, Rick Fehl, Paul Racicot and Sue Klinke, all reactions were favorable. The next steps will be to refine the presentation and re-present to upper management for further approval. Al Nahas will be demoed the product next week. We have identified issues with several of the dBs and this would require additional work to correct these data problems between the systems, this will not be an insignificant task.

Voice Minutes Trading:  USTeleNet has agreed to accept Enron routing data via an automated exchange (XML format) as opposed to the current labor-intensive process..  This will require USTeleNet to develop an interface to their TMS system.  We are also working with Nortel to interface with their Nortel switch via software (i.e. API).  Nortel has a proprietary DMS 250/300 operating system which requires manual input every time a route is changed;  we will continue to investigate the feasibility of interfacing internally-developed software to improve efficiencies & accuracies.  Many suppliers' rates have been downloaded to our environment for purpose of finding least-cost supplier's rates for our traders and creation of rate sheets for confirmation.  New Product Management and Supplier Rate Management modules have been developed and are now being tested by users.  Trader Ratesheet development should be completed & available for testing within the week.     We have scheduled 11/8 & 11/9 for the 4tel / Telesciences software demo.
Deal Prospects / Contact Tracking:  Reviewed options including existing solutions such as EnGAGE, Siebel (off-the-shelf) and an internally developed web-based tool.  Goal is to provide a simple, cost-effective tool that can be used by commercial teams (starting with Mid-Market, DRAM, Minutes ) to track prospects & contacts.
Enron  kicked off an enterprise-wide CRM initiative with the goal of recommending a CRM strategy (including Sales Force Automation) to senior Enron management by October 25.   EBS will only be participating in the assessment / evaluation stage.
Media Services / Strata:  Developed a Tactical Deal Capture product ; in process of completing Sales Invoice functionality for Tactical Settlements, including the ability to generate Sales Invoices on the basis of Physical Spots, Survey-Based GRPs, Overnight-Based GRPs, or PreBill (prior to actual spot airing).  Tactical Deal + Settlements are integrated, using Strata core data coupled with Tactical Deal data.   Continued systematic daily processing of Nielsen Overnight TV & Cable Ratings data (nearly 100,000 lines/day), along with systematic aggregation of Quarter Hour data for each TV program.   Created Buy Statistics & Market Statistics UI against existing Strata data.
EBS Contracts (tactical): Continued development of v5.2.  This release includes enhancements to add attributes for Minutes contracts.  The scheduled release date is 11/06.
EBS Contracts (strategic): Completed updating project plans and will provide to business next week.  Completed database modeling for tasks and reminders.  Began development of client-side (browser) validation for commercial contracts.
EBS Facilities:  Continued development of v3.3.  This release will include the ability to query key systems for their dependency on Facilities and automation of the short description.
Global Counterparty/Common Codes:  Corrected problems with wire information and address roles that were identified during Saber/Globals testing.

Project Name: PPCS/TRPS

Accomplishment - this week
Implement a new project plan to expedite the development effort of removing Xconnect from PPCS.
Connectivity between Pleasanton switch lab and Enron Ardmore/Greenspoint is rebuilt. Lucent 2.5 G test switch now is reachable for acceptance test.
Identify a Lucent 10 G test switch in Portland for acceptance test.
Identify a Lucent 4608 switch can be used for acceptance test. Since the switch is also in production. Extreme caution will be measured for port assignment. Additional coordination with Global Network Management group is required..
Dorado provides TRP prototype demo for provisioning, capacity management, TOC, NOC, GNM and IT. The demo goes very well and receives high remarks from attendants.
Furnish additional requirement to Dorado for TRP development.
All switches are reachable from PPCS in the whole week.
Test contracts running on Portland lab do not collect PM successfully. Investigation is under way. (Eric Liu)
Implement a code check in/out process in a joint development environment without direct network connectivity

Deliverables Scheduled for next week
Finish development to remove xconnect and disconnect from PPCS.
Coordinate with network engineering, network security, provisioning groups and NOC to determine when PPCS network security setting will be upgraded again.
Prepare db migration and production freeze.
Enron continues to furnish up to date business requirement of PPCS replacement product to Dorado.
Coordinate with GNM to identify available port assignment in the San Jose production switch for acceptant test.
Dorado deliver Red Cell API documents to Enron.

Key Date
Dorado delivers TRP prototype 1.0 date is 10-31-2001
Ardmore server goes into production date is 11-19-2001

Issue
Need to work with GNM to reset network security for PPCS before 1.1.2 goes into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to make sure current PPCS 1.0 contract will not send out disconnect commands after the network security setting is upgraded and before 1.1.2 goes into production. (Eric Liu)
Need to implement and communicate the new operation procedure to filed engineer and provisioning. So physical cross connect from SNMS will occur before PPCS PM collection time and physical disconnect from SNMS will occur after PPCS stops collecting PM. (David Workman)
Follow up with Terry Hoop's to find out whether the Luent 2.5 G test switch will be available in Shepherd. (Eric Liu)
Dorado needs to provide a complete set of final source code of PPCS 1.1.2 to Enron. (Dorado)
PPCS access level has been downgraded to prevent cross and disconnect commands sent to the switches. Because of the change, PPCS stop collecting PM data for newly entered contracts 'cause PM initialization requires the same level of access right as cross & disconnect. So security level for PPCS needs to be upgraded before George Babaz's team can continue to enter missing contracts to the system. But the timing is very tricky otherwise there maybe a possibility some existing contracts on version 1.0 will be terminated by PPCS. (Eric Liu)
Dorado needs to start deliver TRP related documents to Enron. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to package PPCS 1.1.2 delivery CDs with all the fix. (Dorado)
Installation documents from Dorado needs to be further flushed out. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to produce timeline and cost estimate for new requirement. (Dorado)
Dorado needs to provide TRP architecture. (Dorado)
Sylvix manager installation (Dorado and Rick Paiste)
Hardware support for outages needs to defined (David Wicks)
Final versions of 1.1.2 documents need to be updated in spotlight document management system (Eric Liu)

Project Name: Utopia

Accomplishment - DB
ECOMS has completed their view in Development and Production. Nothing more is needed of them at this time.
ENFIBER has completed their view in Development and Production. Nothing more is needed of them at this time.
IP ALLOC - A flat file is taken from Dennis Boylan (contains IP address ECOMS number) and put the data into an Oracle table in Utopia... The data will be static, but should be sufficient for the proof of concept.
DEAL LAUNCH has now received their required for supplying the SLA information that is required for the central dB
PPCS has to wait for the completion of their Oracle conversion top be able to supply their view in Development, this will be available sometime next week.
IPN PROD some analysis still needs to be done to get the IPN PROD details into the UTOPIA schema
FACILITIES has completed their view in Development (but it pulls in data from Production). Nothing more is needed of them at this time
dB has now been created and tested on robin.enron.com

Accomplishment - Application
