As you've noted, already approved RTO's are not of an optimally efficient size...Barton's draft is a thinly veiled retrenchment primarily aimed at protecting Southern. The worst part about this is that it ties FERC's hands...they can't do their jobs.....no ability to apply their expertise. Has Barton done a cost-benefit analysis to support 40,000 MW limit? to support current RTO sizes and configurations?
