If this program is implemented for all customers, including DA customers, and
our DA customers get interrupted, we will find ourselves with more energy
than load during the high price periods.  However, I understand that our
customers have business concerns and expect us to represent their interests.
Although we could recommend a pay for curtailment program, this would raise:
1) parity issues between small and large customers that are curtailed; 2)
recovery concerns by the utilities; 3) administrative implementation issues;
and 4) rate increase issues for ratepayers to fund such a program.
