The following is an excerpt from a FERC order issued on Friday:

"Ridgewood Power LLC (Ridgewood) filed comments suggesting that the  shortage
of supply could be remedied in part by relaxing the operating  efficiency and
other regulatory requirements pertaining to Qualifying Facilities  (QFs).
Ridgewood states that the total power production capacity of QFs in
California is approximately 9,000 MWs, of which, between 4,000 and 5,500 MW
are  from qualifying cogeneration facilities (Cogeneration QFs) and the
remainder  from small power production facilities (Small Power QFs).
Ridgewood states  that the Cogeneration segment of the industry is
underutilized because of  operating efficiency and other QF requirements.
With a limited  waiver or other equivalent relief, Ridgewood states that
these underutilized  resources could help relieve current shortages during
both peak and off-peak  periods. Ridgewood estimates that as much as 1,000
MWs would be  immediately available by allowing QFs to sell to the purchasing
utility or into  the competitive market their "above-baseline" output for a
limited time  period. Ridgewood suggests that any such sale would be made
at  market-based rates and would not be subject to the operating and
efficiency  standards.........Section 292.205(c) of the Commission's
regulations  provides that the Commission may waive any of its operating and
efficiency  standards "upon a showing that the facility will produce
significant energy  savings". However, the Commission has exercised its
waiver authority  in a number of cases based on factors such as the limited
durations of the  requested waiver, whether further waivers would be
necessary, whether the  request was intended to remedy specific problems
associated with an innovative  technology, and whether granting waiver would
fulfill PURPA's goals.  We find that many of these same factors are present
here. Consistent with  the goals of PURPA, we find that granting such waiver
in this circumstance will  provide for increased efficiency in the use of the
Cogeneration facilities and  improved reliability of electric service through
increasing the availability of  needed capacity. Therefore, we will grant
temporary waiver of the  operating and efficiency standards to Cogeneration
QFs for sales into  California, effective as of the date of this order. We
will terminate the  waiver effective January 1, 2001."

Let me know if you want the entire order.
