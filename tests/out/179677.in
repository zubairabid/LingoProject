Hi Everybody!

You may see a new individual running around the office.  Please do not turn
him over to building security, he is not the Bessemer Trust thief.
Dave Perrino is a new employee both in our office and with Enron.  He is
Corp/Gov. Affairs and works for Steve Walton.  He will be working on
RTO West, Desert Star Development, WSCC (general 'stuff'), and some national
deregulation.  Please stop by and welcome him to our office.

Cheers,
April Hrach
Administrative Coordinator
Phone: 415-782-7825

P.S.- On a separate note:  The Wall Street Journal sent a survey to Enron,
and to show their appreciation they enclosed a crisp one dollar bill.
Unselfishly, I decided to buy a lottery ticket for the office.  I
am so sorry to say we did not win Wednesday night's jackpot.  On a completely
separate note, I will be taking 6 months off of work to travel
extensively around the world.  : - )

Double Cheers,
April
