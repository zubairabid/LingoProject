Please set up the following people with "trader" status under Transwestern
Pipeline Company.  We will be using Enron On Line to trade pipeline
capacity.  Kevin Hyatt (administrator), Michelle Lokay, Lorraine Lindberg,
Jeff Fawcett, and TK Lohman will all need this access.  My network user ID is
"mlokay" and each trader will respond with their own user ID.  Thanks.
