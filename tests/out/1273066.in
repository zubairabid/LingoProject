IN THE MONEY: Enron - From Energy Trader To Spinmeister

A Dow Jones Newswires Column

(This column was originally published Wednesday.)

NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- With the value of its stock continuing to plummet, Enron Corp. (ENE) tried to put on a good face Wednesday by issuing a press release touting, among other things, increased liquidity.
The problem is that most of the so-called news was three days old, recycled from the company's latest quarterly filing.
And investors weren't fooled by the release. Although the stock of the embattled Houston energy trader regained some ground immediately after the release, climbing to $5.35 a share from $4.60, it quickly gave up most of its gains. One hour after the release, Enron stock was back trading at $4.98 a share, down more than 28% on the day.
"They had to say something, but really didn't have any new news. It's quite incredible," said a Wall Street analyst covering Enron.
Amid mounting fears that Enron's credit woes could thwart its plan to merge with rival Dynegy Inc. (DYN), a merger that many see as the only way for Enron to avoid possible bankruptcy, Enron began its press release by announcing that "it has closed on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines..."
Great news, given the way Enron has been burning through cash. Except that investors who took time to read Enron's filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday already knew that "on November 19, 2001, Enron closed a $450 million new secured line of credit, which will mature in the fourth quarter of 2002." Readers of the company's 10-Q also knew that the $450 million credit was secured by the assets of Enron's Northern Natural Gas Co.
Meanwhile, the real news everyone was waiting for, an announcement about whether a $690 million loan due next Tuesday had been extended, has yet to be finalized.
Enron said in its release that it expected that an extension to mid-December would be formalized soon.
Separately, people familiar with the matter said J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. continue to work with Enron to extend the maturity of the syndicated loan, which contains a clause that, unbeknownst to many, was triggered by Enron's ratings downgrade to "BBB-" by Standard & Poor's Corp. earlier this month. The clause stipulated that Enron would have to repay the $690 million note on November 27 if it didn't post collateral.
Those people said that the syndicated loan, which is built inside a structured vehicle used to finance minority interests in power and energy sectors around the world, would likely be extended to the middle of 2002 when other bank loans to Enron come due. About $1.75 billion of Enron's $3.5 billion in syndicated bank loans come due in May 2002 and will likely need to be restructured.
About $250 million of the assets securing the $690 million loan are in the process of being sold and will be used to pay down the loan, reducing the outstanding portion of the loan that will need to be restructured, according to the people familiar with the terms.
Meanwhile, Dynegy also tried to rally, although somewhat halfheartedly, investors around its plan to acquire Enron's stock. Dynegy said it was encouraged by reports that Enron closed on its remaining $450 million credit facility and news of the extension of the $690 million loan. Under the terms of the acquisition, Enron holders would receive 0.2685 Dynegy share for each Enron share.
Investors, however, remain more circumspect, unmoved by the whopping 104% risk premium currently attached to the merger. (That's how much investors buying Enron shares would make if the deal was closing Wednesday.)
Aside from continued worries about how much bad news may still come, analysts and traders appear particularly concerned with Enron's liquidity, or lack thereof, going forward.
"We're having a hard time believing that this new credit infusion (from the banks), even with the $1.5 billion from Dynegy, will provide enough liquidity for Enron," one risk arbitrageur at a New York hedge fund said.
As part of the merger agreement between Dynegy and Enron, Chevron Texaco, which owns 26% of Dynegy, already injected $1.5 billion into Enron. Another $1 billion is expected upon closing of the deal.

USA: Houston economy seen weathering major layoffs.
By Ellen Chang

11/23/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.

HOUSTON, Nov 23 (Reuters) - Houston's economy, buffered by a broad and diverse tax base, should be able to weather thousands of layoffs from some of the city's major corporations, including energy powerhouse Enron Corp., economists and analysts said.
Financially ailing Enron Corp. , which has 21,000 employees worldwide and is in talks to be bought by Houston-based rival Dynegy Inc. , is the third major employer in the city to announce severe financial problems in recent months. Analysts expect layoffs if the merger occurs.
Continental announced a layoff of 3,000 employees after the Sept. 11 attacks and Hewlett-Packard Co.'s plan to buy Compaq Computer Corp. will, if finalized, result in 15,000 layoffs at the two companies. Compaq also announced 8,000 layoffs worldwide in July.
"It's fair to say that the potential layoffs at Enron and the layoffs at Continental, taken alone, are negative factors, although probably small in the grand scope of the Houston economy," said Phil Scheps, director of Houston's finance and administration department.
Since last month when Enron became a target of a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into financial dealings with partnerships, the energy giant's market share has steadily eroded.
While neither Enron nor Dynegy have given any indication of the number of layoffs that could hit Houston, Barton Smith, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston, said the layoffs "will be spread out over a long period of time and will not be excessive."
Robin Kapiloff, an analyst at Moody's Investors Service, said the city's efforts to diversify its economy over the past decade will protect its revenue collections, even as some of the city's biggest employers suffer. "We're watching to see where things go now," she said.
Alex Fraser, a director at Standard & Poor's, said the ratings agency isn't concerned about Houston's credit position at this point. "While Enron is certainly a large player and prominent corporation, we're unclear on what the impact would be."
While the fourth largest city in the country experienced a bit of a slowdown since the Sept. 11 attacks, Houston has outperformed the rest of the nation.
With a tax base of $87.3 billion in 2001, Houston is also buffered by the Texas Medical Center, the city's largest employer. Next year the city's tax base is estimated to grow to $95 billion.
Still, the national recession, energy price weakness in general, and the initial loss of consumer confidence related to the attacks has caused the city to reduce its estimate of sales tax growth to 1.5 percent from 5 percent. That revised estimate equals a $13 million reduction in the city's $1.4 billion budget.
But the city's property tax revenue has not been affected. Only a small change in property tax collections is expected in 2002 because valuations are based on Jan. 1 data and for most of 2001, real estate growth was very large, Scheps said.
While recent economic indicators appear positive, and consumer confidence has quickly rebounded, a better read on the strength of Houston's tax revenue collections will be available in February when the city receives data for the December holiday season, Scheps said.

Meeting in Singapore to discuss Enron's arbitration proceedings against Indian state

NEW DELHI, India (AP) - A panel of arbitrators will meet in Singapore on Saturday to discuss legal action by Enron Corp. against the western Indian state of Maharashtra, an Enron official said.
The Houston-based company has a 65 percent stake in the Dabhol Power Project in western India, and is locked in a dispute with the Maharashtra State Electricity Board over unpaid electricity charges.
The Singapore meeting is likely to be followed by arbitration in a London court, Dow Jones Newswires reported, quoting an unidentified Enron official on Friday.
The company suspended operation of the power plant in May and now plans to withdraw from India.
Enron has invested about dlrs 1 billion in equity of the 2,184 megawatt of power project, the largest ever foreign investment in India.
Enron sold electricity produced from naphtha to its sole customer, the government-owned power utility in Maharashtra, which found the costs too high.
The company also served notice to the federal government for not honoring a contract that required the government it to cover the Maharashtra state power utility's unpaid dues.
Earlier this year, Enron's chairman Kenneth Lay wrote to Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee threatening to sue the government for up to dlrs 5 billion if it did not resolve the dispute.
Dabhol Power Co. initiated arbitration against the state government for not honoring guarantees on power bills due for December 2000 and January, this year.
The panel, which has been appointed by the Dabhol Power Company and the Maharashtra state government, includes an independent observer.

Enron SEC filing contained information Dynegy was unaware of - report

NEW YORK (AFX) - Monday's SEC filing by Enron's Corp contained information that proposed buyer Dynegy Inc had not known about, the Wall Street Journal quoted a person familiar with the merger plans as saying.
Dynegy representatives plan to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence on Enron, the source said, without specifying what the new information was.
In the filing, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of dollars of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than 2 bln usd in loans by the end of the year.
Dynegy announced Wednesday that it is working to accelerate regulatory approvals required to complete the acquisition in accordance with the previously announced agreement.
The Journal quoted analysts as saying Dynegy is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the deal.
It also cited Fitch director Ralph Pellecchia as saying that, without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible".

Dynegy's Decision to Buy Enron Hits Crossroads Amid Rising Financial Woes

11/23/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron (ENE) shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said.
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy (DYN) shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enron.
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was.
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy.
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price.
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share.

Enron casts pall on analysts: 'Everyone had a buy on the stock' all the way down

For thousands of people burned by Enron Corp.'s spectacular implosion, it must have been tough to feel thankful yesterday.
Over the past month, the Houston-based company has admitted its earnings reports going back four years are useless, written down billions in worthless investments, and fired its chief financial officer in a failed bid to shore up its plunging stock.
The slide in Enron's stock (ENE/NYSE) has already wiped out US$67-billion in shareholder wealth. Now it may lose its last lifeline, a US$7.93-billion takeover offer from Dynegy Inc.
Enron's fall is proving to be more than just a cautionary tale about sketchy accounting. The case is raising serious questions about the responsibility of analysts who strongly recommended a stock that many now admit they never really understood.
"The public isn't going to trust stock analysts for awhile," said Scott Preston, a San Francisco-based analyst with Research Capital Corp. who does not cover Enron. "Every analyst had a buy on the stock. And it's not like there was only one little issue there. It's a mess and big brokerages were coming out as it was on the way down saying put this thing in your Grandmother's [RRSP]."
But Wall Street's embarrassment pales next to the pain of shareholders, including Enron employees whose pensions were loaded with the stock.
"I have lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything," Roy Rinard, a long-time Enron staffer, said this week as he announced that employees have banded together for a class-action lawsuit against the company.
Several analysts have acknowledged that Enron's financial statements were routinely incomprehensible. But with brokerages vying for the millions of dollars in equity and bond underwriting business Enron provided every year, many analysts chose to focus on the company's growth, and failed to ask tough questions about its books.
Critics say the red flags were waving long ago.
The first clear sign of trouble came Aug. 14, when Jeffrey Skilling quit the CEO job he took over just seven months earlier, citing personal reasons. Former chief executive Kenneth Lay reclaimed the job. "Our business is strong and our growth prospects have never been better," Mr. Lay said at the time.
In fact, cracks were already appearing in the business. Enron's plan to start trading capacity on fibre optic networks was a costly failure, and the company was locked in a prolonged dispute with the Indian government over energy purchases in the region.
In October, Enron surprised investors by reporting its first quarterly loss in more than four years, due in large part to the writedown of US$1-billion in bad investments. Within a week, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission started investigating Enron's finances.
The company soon admitted major accounting errors dating back to 1997. Its profits had been overstated by US$586-million, or 20%. The company revealed that some of the investments it had written off were limited partnerships headed by CFO Andrew Fastow -- a serious breach of good corporate governance. Mr. Fastow was fired, but it didn't stop Enron's descent.
The pain may be far from over.
Facing a year of regulatory hearings to approve the merger, and a rapidly devaluing asset in Enron, many fear Dynegy will walk away from the deal. If that happens, Enron may be doomed.
The stock closed Wednesday at US$5.01, down 93% this year. Dynegy closed at US$39.76, valuing the Enron offer at US$10.67 a share. The fact that Enron's stock is trading so far below the offer price is a sure sign that investors doubt it will proceed, at least not at the current offer price.
All this has left investors wondering how so many could have been so wrong, about so much. And how can so many continue to endorse the stock?
Of the 18 analysts that cover the stock, 10 still rate it a "buy." Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleisher removed Enron from his recommended list this week, but only after his firm was excluded from the banking syndicate arranging the Dynegy deal.
Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, dropped Enron from "buy" to "sell" this week, citing its long history of spotty disclosure, and often evasive answers to questions. She acknowledged to clients that her downgrade is "too little, too late" for many.

Enron looking for US$1.5B boost to balance sheet: Expects cash from buyout firms, private equity investors

NEW YORK - Officials working to shore up Enron Corp.'s balance sheet said yesterday the struggling energy trader hoped to receive capital injections of more than US$1.5-billion as early as next week.
Enron is in talks about investments of US$250-million with JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup and is also hoping to raise at least US$1-billion from private equity investors.
People close to Enron declined to comment on which buyout firms might wish to invest in Enron, but the Blackstone Group, which was reported to be talking to the company before Dynegy Inc. made its US$9-billion rescue bid, is understood not to be talking to Enron any longer.
Members of the 20-strong bank lending group, led by JP Morgan Chase and Citigroup, are being asked to defer the maturities of their upcoming debt until after completion of the merger.
The move comes as reports from Goldman Sachs & Co. and Fitch, the credit rating agency, raised questions about the company's cash flow and its medium-term viability.
David Fleischer, a Goldman Sachs analyst, argued that cash balances were inadequate to meet US$2.8-billion of debt obligations falling due before the end of the year. People close to Enron say that nearly US$1-billion of that debt has already been restructured.
The Fitch report said that if the Dynegy deal was not completed Enron would struggle to meet US$9-billion of obligations, due before the end of next year.
People close to Enron insisted Dynegy remained committed to the merger and played down talk of renegotiation.
Dynegy would shortly issue a statement reasserting its commitment to the deal, they predicted.
But bankers acknowledged the fate of the Dynegy deal was largely irrelevant in terms of the company's immediate liquidity problems.
The company has raised about US$7-billion in cash, enough to cover its operating costs since a US$1.2-billion writedown of shareholder equity plunged it into crisis on Oct. 16.
However, the company's cash flow is being squeezed. The computer screens in front of energy traders at Enron's London headquarters still glow, even if they are doing much less business following the U.S. group's financial woes.
The Belgravia offices house Europe's biggest electricity trader, which accounts for about a fifth of all European power contracts, worth roughly (ps)70-billion ($158-billion) last year in British, Nordic and other European markets.
Fears over Enron's credit rating have prompted a sharp fall in its European electricity trading. Nonetheless, some companies that had previously withdrawn from buying and selling power with Enron have resumed trading with it in the short-term market.
Few want to risk trading further than a week or two ahead, however, given continuing doubts over the company's finances.

Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endangered their retirement funds. The lawsuit, filed in Houston under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, alleges that Enron encouraged the employees to invest more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit was filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker, Steve Lacey. Enron shares have plunged more than 90 per cent over the past several months after an accounting controversy that eventually caused it to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating more than $580-million (U.S.) of reported income.

Dynegy's Bid for Enron Appears Less Appealing --- Merger Deal Loses Luster as Shares Tumble --- Acquisition Target Faces Numerous Earnings Problems

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multi-billion-dollar deal.
The pressure is coming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas in the U.S. In the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion (1.1 billion euros) write-off of assets, restated downward the past several years of earnings and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity. The problems owe largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships run by some of its own executives now under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. In documents filed with the SEC on Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.
On the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Enron shares were down 28% at $5.01 each, after having dropped some 23% on Tuesday. There was no trading Thursday. More than 115 million shares changed hands Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also fell, traders said.
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's shares, which were also among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Dynegy shares were at $39.76 each on Wednesday, down $1.94.
Dynegy Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement" though it continued doing due diligence review on Enron. Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough.
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To consummate the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 of its shares for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price.
However, from a price point of view, the deal is looking ever less attractive to Dynegy.
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 a share, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price.
Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price.
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts is also turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron executives have predicted that the merger, which is supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said that because of Enron's financial problems a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said a "likely scenario" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply lower to about 0.15 Dynegy shares for each Enron share.
Such a move wouldn't be without precedent. According to a person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of Enron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was above $80 a share.
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover the significant business that has been lost" in its energy trading operations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," wrote Mr. Fleischer.
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to significantly renegotiate the terms, Enron might be pushed into bankruptcy. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron request for bankruptcy protection from creditors "is highly possible," said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one notch above noninvestment grade, or "junk" status. But Fitch also said that Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls" in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contributing to liquidity pressures.
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which has a specialty in bankruptcy and corporate restructuring. One energy trader said Wednesday that some colleagues had even started a betting pool about the timing of a possible Enron bankruptcy filing. But he quickly added that he had no knowledge that the company has contemplated such a step.
Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spokeswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the merger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said that his company had alternatives to the Dynegy deal, but he has declined to identify them.

Enron Europe carries on trading.

The screens in front of energy traders at Enron's London headquarters are still glowing, even if they are doing much less business following the US group's financial woes.
The Belgravia offices house Europe's biggest electricity trader, which accounts for about a fifth of all European power contracts, worth roughly GBP70bn ($99bn) last year in UK, Nordic and other European markets.
Fears over Enron's credit rating have prompted a sharp fall in its European electricity trading. Nonetheless, some companies which had previously withdrawn from buying and selling power with Enron have resumed trading with it in the short-term market.
Few want to risk trading further than a week or two ahead, however, given continuing doubts over the company's finances. Whether Enron can survive depends on the commitment of Dynegy, the rival US energy group, to its $9bn rescue takeover announced two weeks ago.
John Sherriff, president and chief executive of Enron Europe, was anxious on Thursday to show that it was still "business as usual" for his energy traders.
He estimates they are transacting about 70 per cent of the number of contracts they would normally expect, but only about 40 per cent by volume. Rival traders believe volumes may have fallen much further.
Contracts ranging from a day ahead to many years hence are used as a hedge to protect generators and retailers from risks of sudden price changes.
As financial instruments they are traded many times over. As a result, the total value of the transactions is much higher than the cost of the actual electricity delivered. However, the transactions play an increasingly important role in oiling competitive electricity markets.
Rival European power companies and traders are anxious that Enron should not fail.
Brian Senior, director of trading and asset management at Innogy, the UK arm of the demerged National Power, said recent transactions had shown there was sufficient liquidity in European markets to cope if Enron disappeared.
Traders were more concerned that Enron might not be able to honour existing long-term contracts. "This could have a domino effect, putting pressure on other companies," said Mr Senior.
US power companies failed in similar circumstances after the Ohio-based Federal Energy defaulted on power contracts in 1998, he said.
Martin Stanley, president of European energy trading for TXU, another large US energy group, said: "We are watching the situation carefully and would want to do nothing to add to Enron's problems by making unhelpful comments about their current position."
Mr Sherriff said: "Counter-parties are generally being very supportive."
Innogy said it had resumed limited trading with the US group but was "watching the situation carefully". TXU said: "We are still trading with Enron in the short-term market but less than we were."
The Nordic market is one of the most active for power trading. US groups such as Enron, TXU and Dynegy have helped to expand the UK market, while Enron has a strong base in Germany.

Enron Faces Suits by 401(k) Plan Participants
By Theo Francis and Ellen Schultz
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

Enron Corp., the embattled Houston energy and trading company, has been sued by members of its employee-retirement plan, which has suffered losses because of Enron's plummeting stock price.
Two separate lawsuits, filed in federal court in Houston, allege Enron misled participants in its 401(k) retirement plan about the risks of investing in the company's shares and note that the company forced the employees to remain invested in its stock even as the shares fell. Amid growing disclosures of financial problems in recent weeks, the company "locked down" the retirement plan from Oct. 17 to Nov. 19 to make administrative changes, which prevented employees from selling Enron shares as the share price collapsed.
Enron, which recently agreed to be acquired by Dynegy Inc., Houston, because of mounting financial problems, has seen its stock price fall to $5.01 on Wednesday from a peak of nearly $90 a share last year. The decline has been costly to participants in Enron's retirement plan because more than 60% of the 401(k) assets were invested in Enron shares at the end of last year, according to one of the suits.
The first suit was filed Nov. 13 on behalf of plan participants by Campbell Harrison & Wright LLP, a Houston law firm, and the second was filed Tuesday by Seattle-based Hagens Berman LLP. Both seek class-action certification.
Enron said its corporate policy is not to comment on pending lawsuits. A spokeswoman also said the company's 401(k) plan offers participants 18 investment choices, one of which is company stock.
The company's stock has fallen amid mounting losses and disclosures that it had extensive off-balance-sheet dealings with a web of partnerships headed by former company officials. The Securities and Exchange Commission has launched a formal investigation into the company's accounting, and Enron has said it will restate years of financial information.
The suits against Enron are the latest of a series of suits filed against companies over losses in the company-stock portion of their 401(k) plans. The suits allege the plan trustees breached their fiduciary duties by continuing to offer company stock, even after they became aware of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. All the suits are pending.
As with most of these companies, Enron matches employee contributions to the 401(k) with shares of Enron stock, and also offers Enron stock as an investment choice, in addition to a variety of mutual funds. About $1.3 billion of the plan's $2.1 billion in assets was invested in Enron shares at the end of 2000, according to the suit filed by Campbell Harrison.
Pamela Tittle, a participant in the 401(k) plan who worked in the finance department and a named plaintiff in the Enron suit filed by Campbell Harrison & Wright, had roughly 2,000 shares of Enron stock in her retirement account and has suffered losses of about $140,000 as a result of the stock's decline. The suit alleges that the trustees of the Enron 401(k) plan violated their fiduciary duties by not informing plan participants that the company stock was in peril.
The suit filed by Hagens Berman, also alleges that the company failed to warn participants about risks of remaining invested in Enron stock. In addition, it accuses Enron of systematically misrepresenting its financial results since 1998 in connection with the partnerships under investigation by the SEC.
Roy E. Rinard, a lineman for Enron in Oregon who is a named plaintiff in the suit filed by Hagens Berman, has seen the value of his retirement plan fall to $70,000 from $470,000, largely as a result of the decline in Enron's stock. "I feel like I have been betrayed," Mr. Rinard said in press release issued by his lawyers. "I lost my savings, my plans for the future, everything."
Under federal pension law, companies are allowed to offer their own stock in retirement plans, and are allowed to force employees to hold onto the stock. Enron doesn't let employees diversify out of shares they receive as matching contributions to the 401(k) plan until age 50.
However, plan trustees are supposed to operate the plan in the best interests of the participants, which includes choosing prudent investments. Generally, to prove that the plan's administrators breached their fiduciary duties, employees must show that the trustees knew the stock was a bad investment. This presents a high hurdle, so it is not surprising that prior lawsuits over losses in company stock in 401(k) plans have generally come in the wake of allegations of accounting irregularities.
Lynn Sarko, one of Ms. Tittle's attorneys with Seattle's Keller Rohrback LLP, is also co-lead counsel in a similar lawsuit against Lucent Technologies Inc., Murray Hill, N.J. Another firm representing Ms. Tittle is Dalton Gotto Samson & Kilgard PLC, which is lead counsel in a similar suit against Ikon Office Solutions Inc., Malvern, Pa. The two law firms are representing Ms. Tittle with Campbell Harrison & Wright.
The suits against Lucent and Ikon, like the suit against Enron, allege that then-current plan trustees kept offering company stock in the plan despite knowing of serious business problems that would hurt the stock price. Representatives for Ikon and Lucent say their companies didn't require employees to invest in the company stock, and educated employees about the need for diversification.
The suit in which Mr. Rinard is plaintiff notes that on Oct. 17, a day after Enron announced the company was taking a nonrecurring charge totaling $1.01 billion in the third quarter, Enron "locked down" the 401(k) plan's assets, preventing participants from selling Enron shares. (A "lock-down" occurs when a retirement plan is transferred from one administrator to another, and generally lasts several weeks, during which time participants can't make changes in their investment choices).
The lock-down was lifted on Nov. 19. In the interim, on Nov. 8, Enron announced it would be forced to restate downward its reported financial results from 1997 through 2000. By the time the lock-down was lifted, as a result of all the negative news the shares had fallen to below $9 a share from $32.20 on Oct. 17, when the lockup started, Hagens Berman attorney Karl Barth said.
"They were locked into it right when Enron knew it was going to be announcing some really bad news," Mr. Barth said. "Mr. Rinard's looking at having no retirement savings now. It's a horrible thing to have to start over in your 50s."

Enron says sorry as shares keep falling.

Investors in Enron must be wondering when their luck will change. The company's shares were sent tumbling again this week after the company revealed that its credit crunch was worse than many investors thought. The news spurred talk that rival energy trader Dynegy may have to inject more cash under its plan to buy Enron - or could even walk away from the deal.
In a quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron said it must pay down a $690 million note by Nov. 27 because of the recent downgrade of its credit rating. Unless Enron repays the note or posts a letter of credit, the unidentified creditor can start liquidating Enron assets. These include CEG Rio, a gas distribution company in Brazil that Enron is already in the process of selling to pay down other debt.
At the market close on Tuesday, Enron shares stood at $6.99/share, about 39% below Dynegy's bid price of $11.60/share, and a fraction of the $90.75 peak reached in August 2000 when the company was in its asset-light pomp.
At least Enron is trying to say sorry - sort of. In a conference call with analysts and investors last week, chairman and chief executive Kenneth Lay indicated regret for the series of bad investments in non-core businesses that has nearly bankrupted the big energy trading company. "In hindsight, we made some very bad investments in some non-core businesses," Lay acknowledged. "I could not have ever contemplated the events we as a company and you as a stakeholder have faced over the last several weeks. This has resulted in a complete loss of investor confidence."
And, via the Dynegy deal, a complete loss of Enron independence, although even that is not cut and dried. If Enron fails to settle the $690 million debt repayment next week, its credit rating would likely be reduced to sub-investment or "junk" status. And if that happened, it would qualify as a "material adverse change," allowing Dynegy to pull out of the merger if it wanted to. Analysts doubt things will get this bad, still giving the deal a 70-90% chance of going through.

From Sunbeam to Enron, Andersen's Reputation Suffers
By FLOYD NORRIS

11/23/2001
The New York Times
Page 1, Column 2
c. 2001 New York Times Company

THIS has been the worst year ever for Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm that once deserved the title of conscience of the industry. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed civil fraud complaints against the Andersen partner who audited Sunbeam and against the firm itself in the Waste Management case.
Now Enron has repudiated the financial statements that were certified by Arthur Andersen, in the process shaving more than half a billion dollars from the company's reported profits in recent years.
All of which raises the question: Has Arthur Andersen become the black sheep of the accounting industry?
It is not an easy question to answer, and not everyone is willing to rush to judgment. ''If you want to attack Andersen for Enron, you need to know more than we know,'' Arthur Levitt, the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, said this week.
But if there is a thread connecting what is known about the three cases, it is materiality. In all three cases, Andersen auditors spotted bad accounting but were persuaded it was immaterial and therefore allowed it to go ahead.
Materiality is one of those flexible concepts that can get accountants into trouble. The idea is that it doesn't much matter if a few little things were gotten wrong. But they can add up.
At Enron, however, they did not add up to that much -- a total of $93 million over four years. The biggest restatement of Enron profits concerns a related party that Enron now says should have been consolidated. It is not clear if Andersen had the facts needed to make that decision at the time.
To those who treasure the role of auditors, the humiliation of Andersen is painful. Back in the 1950's, it was Leonard Spacek, Andersen's managing partner, who warned that ''the profession's existence is in peril'' because it was not showing enough independence. His public prodding was crucial in making the industry do a better job. Two decades ago, when the issue on the table was pension accounting, Andersen was the only major accounting firm to break with clients and push for good rules.
Now Andersen's backbone is open to question. It was evidence that senior people at Andersen repeatedly gave in to pressure from Waste Management that led the S.E.C. to bring that suit, which the firm chose to settle without admitting it had done anything wrong. The partner that the S.E.C. says looked the other way at Sunbeam is fighting the accusations, and Andersen says he acted properly.
Lynn Turner, who was chief accountant of the S.E.C. at the time and is now director of the Center for Quality Financial Reporting at Colorado State University, says what is happening to Andersen now is reminiscent of what happened to Coopers & Lybrand when he was a partner there and the firm had a series of highly publicized blown audits.
''We got bludgeoned to death in the press,'' he said. ''People did not even want to see us at their doorsteps. It was brutal, but we deserved it. We had gotten into this mentality in the firm of making business judgment calls.'' By that he meant that the firm paid too much attention to not offending clients and not enough to good accounting.
For Andersen to avoid that fate, its relatively new chief executive, Joseph Berardino, who declined to be interviewed for this column, will need to set a tone inside the firm making clear that he expects auditors to show the backbone that Mr. Spacek epitomized. And then he will have to convince the public of that.

Dynegy Deal To Buy Enron Hits Crossroads
By Rebecca Smith and John R. Emshwiller
Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal

(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

Even as it reiterated its intention to purchase Enron Corp., Dynegy Inc. is coming under increasing pressure to renegotiate or walk away from the multibillion-dollar deal.
The pressure is stemming from the continuing slide in the price of Enron shares and the mounting financial problems at the Houston energy-trading company, the nation's biggest marketer of electricity and natural gas. During the past month, Enron has taken a $1 billion write-off of assets, revised downward the earnings of the past several years and taken a $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity.
The problems have been due largely to dealings Enron had with private partnerships, run by some of its own executives, under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In an SEC filing Monday, Enron disclosed hundreds of millions of potential additional write-offs as well as the possibility that its weakening financial condition could force it to repay more than $2 billion in loans by the end of the year.
As of 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Enron shares fell $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01 each after having dropped 23% Tuesday. In excess of 115 million shares traded Wednesday, more than four times the volume of any other Big Board stock. Enron's bonds also again traded sharply lower, market observers said.
The turmoil spilled over to Dynegy's stock, which also was among the most actively traded on the New York Stock Exchange. As of 4 p.m. Wednesday, Dynegy shares fell $1.94 to $39.76 each.
On Wednesday, Dynegy issued a statement in which Chairman and Chief Executive Chuck Watson said his company was working "to accelerate the regulatory approvals required to complete the merger in accordance with the previously announced agreement" though it continued to perform "due diligence" on Enron.
Under the merger agreement, Dynegy has opportunities to renegotiate or walk away from the deal if Enron's financial and legal problems become severe enough. However, some observers said it can be difficult to invoke these so-called material adverse change clauses. They point to a decision earlier this year by a Delaware Chancery Court judge who forced Tyson Foods Inc. to complete a planned purchase of IBP Inc. even though Tyson, a Springdale, Ark., food-products company, had wanted to cancel the transaction because of a drop in IBP's earnings and accounting problems at an IBP unit.
Dynegy officials didn't return calls seeking comment. To complete the deal, two-thirds of Dynegy shareholders and a majority of Enron shareholders would have to give their approval. No dates for those votes have been set.
One person familiar with the merger plans said the SEC filing Monday by Enron contained information Dynegy hadn't known about. Dynegy representatives planned to work through the weekend evaluating the importance of this new information as part of the company's due diligence, this person said. It couldn't be determined what the new information was.
The merger agreement, announced Nov. 9, calls for Dynegy to exchange 0.2685 share for each of Enron's roughly 850 million fully diluted shares, giving the purchase a value of about $9 billion at Dynegy's current stock price. However, from a price standpoint, the deal is appearing less attractive to Dynegy.
On the day of the merger announcement, Enron shares were trading at about $8.63 each, or about 83% of the purchase price under the exchange ratio. As of Wednesday, Enron's market price was only about 47% of the merger-formula price. Such a sharp deterioration is unusual following a merger announcement, when the stock price of the company being acquired generally begins trading relatively close to the offering price.
Sentiment among Wall Street analysts also is turning against the merger. Initially, many analysts lauded the merger as a move that would rescue Enron and provide a major boost to Houston-based Dynegy. Dynegy and Enron officials have predicted that the merger, supposed to be completed late next year, would significantly and immediately increase Dynegy's earnings.
Now analysts are challenging that assumption. Ron Barone, managing director at UBS Warburg LLC, said he believes that because of Enron's financial problems, a combined company would actually have lower earnings next year than Dynegy would have by itself. Mr. Barone said he thinks a "likely scenario" is that the merger formula will be renegotiated sharply down to about 0.15 Dynegy share for each Enron share.
Such a ratcheting down wouldn't be without precedent in the deal. According to one person familiar with the merger negotiations, Dynegy reduced the exchange formula at least once prior to the Nov. 9 announcement because of Enron's rapidly sinking stock price, which at the beginning of this year was above $80 a share.
In perhaps the most significant sign of the turning tide on Wall Street, Goldman Sachs analyst David Fleischer lowered his ratings on Enron and Dynegy. A longtime Enron fan, Mr. Fleischer issued a report expressing doubts that the merger would help Dynegy's earnings and whether Enron could "recover the significant business that has been lost" in its giant energy-trading operations. "The Enron machine continues to sputter," Mr. Fleischer wrote.
Some observers say that if Dynegy walked away from the deal or tried to renegotiate the terms significantly, Enron might be pushed into a bankruptcy-law filing. Without the Dynegy acquisition and continued support from its bankers and customers, an Enron bankruptcy-court filing "is highly possible," said Ralph Pellecchia, a senior director at Fitch, a credit-ratings agency. On Wednesday, Fitch maintained its credit rating on Enron at just one notch above noninvestment-grade, or "junk," status. But Fitch also said it believed Enron's trading partners had made "significant cash collateral calls" in recent days that are "well in excess of previous expectations," contributing to "liquidity pressures."
Among the advisers Enron has hired during its current crisis is the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which specializes in bankruptcy and corporate-workout situations. Asked about a possible bankruptcy filing, an Enron spokeswoman said the company expects the Dynegy deal to go through and therefore doesn't expect to have to look at alternatives to the merger. Since the merger announcement, Enron Chairman Kenneth Lay has said his company had alternatives to the Dynegy deal but he has declined to identify them. Enron said it made some progress improving its financial position. The company said it reached a final agreement with units of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. and Citigroup Inc. on the remaining $450 million of a previously announced $1 billion in secured credit lines. Enron said lenders had agreed to extend repayment of an existing $690 million note to mid-December from next week. The spokeswoman said a restructuring of that obligation is expected to be completed next month so that repayment wouldn't be required this year.

Options Report
Premiums Stay High on Enron's Near Options, And `Doubling Up' Date Looms for Tax Losses
By Kopin Tan
Dow Jones Newswires

The Wall Street Journal

NEW YORK -- Volatility and premiums on Enron's near-month options remain extremely high. It is a sign that investors are willing to pay a rich price for option protection and expect the stock to be unsettled as the Houston company sorts through its credit and debt problems and seeks to calm frazzled investors.
Enron near-month defensive puts traded heavily in an otherwise quiet session Wednesday, as investors bought them to hedge. The December 5 puts traded more than 10,000 contracts and jumped 45 cents to $1.10 at the Chicago Board Options Exchange. The stock closed down $1.98, or 28%, to $5.01, as of 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.
Enron's calls traded actively as some investors sold them to generate income. Traders noted some call buying -- especially after Enron procured a three-week extension on a $690 million note -- as some hopeful investors bet on Enron pulling through its troubles and proceeding with its merger with Dynegy Inc. Enron's December 5 calls traded more than 14,500 contracts, compared with open interest of 710, as they fell $1.45 to $1.15 at the CBOE.
For investors who want to book a tax loss on beaten-down stocks, the "wash sale" rule can be a hurdle, because it essentially prevents taxpayers from selling stock or securities at a loss and then reacquiring "substantially identical" securities within a 30-day period before or after that loss. This poses a problem for those who want to book a loss yet own stocks whose prices now make them attractive "buy" candidates.
In addition, the Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that the wash-sale rule will disallow a loss if the investor sells an in-the-money put, because there is a strong likelihood that stock will be put to or acquired by the investor.
So investors typically get around the wash-sale rule by "doubling up": buying additional stock or options, waiting at least 31 days, and then selling the original stock to book the loss. Investors double up by buying calls, which locks a price to buy stock and achieves the same effect as buying additional stock.

INDIA PRESS: Enron May Sell Dabhol Stake For $500 Mln

11/22/2001
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE) may be forced to sell its stake in Dabhol Power Co. for around $500 million, half of the asking price of $1 billion, reports the Business Standard, quoting the New York Times.
According to the report, Tata Power Co. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) - the Indian bidders for Enron's 65% stake in the 2,184 megawatt Dhabol plant - were reportedly willing to pay only half of the asking price. If the lenders and prospective buyers adopt a take it-or-leave it posture, Enron may have little choice but to accept their offer and take a huge loss, the newspaper said.
Dabhol, located in the western Indian state of Maharashtra, is India's largest single foreign investment at $2.9 billion.

Lawsuit claims Enron led workers astray, hurt retirement funds%)

11/22/2001
Associated Press Newswires
Copyright 2001. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

HOUSTON (AP) - Two Enron Corp. workers are suing the company, claiming it endangered their retirement funds.
The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Houston under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, asserts that Enron encouraged the employees to invest more heavily in company stock just before the stock tanked. The lawsuit was filed by Portland, Ore., utility lineman Roy Rinard and co-worker, Steve Lacey.
Enron shares have plunged more than 90 percent over the past several months after the departure of the company's chief executive and an accounting controversy that eventually caused it to restate its earnings since 1997, eliminating more than $580 million of reported income.
Steve Berman, managing partner for the law firm of Hagens Berman in Seattle, said Enron touted the value of its stock and encouraged employees to put their entire portfolio into Enron stock.
Enron officials didn't emphasize the risk and instead painted the situation as positive, especially when the company's stock began to slide, said Berman, who is hoping to get the suit certified as a class-action case.
Berman wants to prove that the 401(k) plan executives failed
