I have NOT read any of the following material.  I wanted to forward the
attached information from Wildhorse on to everyone for an initial review
ASAP.  Based on my verbal conversations with Kent Harris (Wildhorse) just
now, we will probably need a meeting just to discuss their intent and
understand the variables affecting the proposal.  Also, as you will read
below, this is only a working draft; i.e. they still have to make additional
revisions.............

After an in-depth analysis, I will present various options for the group to
discuss and revise, if appropriate.

Thx.

P.S.  If I've left someone off the list above, please forward.  I will
caution that since we are officially involved in a sensitive (potentially
difficult) negotiation, it may be more effective to have a smaller audience
reviewing the proposal options to ensure there is no leakage of our leverage
or negotiating position.
