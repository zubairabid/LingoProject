I am unable to offer any ISS for an intra day nomination today or for tomorrow's gas day.  Operations is anticipating warm weather in Buffalo, (a balmy 65 degrees) so our LDC will be injecting at their maximum amount, as will the other firm shippers.

If you have small amounts, under 10,000 dth call me and I can let you know if we could squeeze it in somewhere.

As you all know, I tell you daily, IT is available.  Let's get strategic and use it.  Volumes over 100,000 dth can be moved North to South, or vice versa.

Now for a little Thursday inspiration.....a quote.....
"It is better to be looked over than overlooked."  - Mae West
I think that is applicable to men and women.
