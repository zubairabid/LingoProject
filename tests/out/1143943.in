Everyone -- especially Jerry!  The other day on the conference call it was mentioned that many transactions dealing with Enron stock had been canceled.  I made a transaction to buy Enron stock on the day it closed at $.61; when I went into the system on Fri. Hewitt showed that that transaction had been canceled; stock was at $.26; a sigh of relief for me.  I have been off line since Friday and upon coming back in I was curious about where my normal contributions went.  Imagine my surprise that my transaction had now taken place--I'm only happy that stock has risen.  It is not my habit to check this site very often--we can't live this way--when we see something posted on the system we need to be able to rely on that information!  Does this make sense?
Jerry:  I know that you said that the problem was in the manpower not the system when you spoke on the conference call the other day.  Instead of stating that the order had been canceled it would be much better to state that there was a delay in posting.  I'm assuming that my transaction took place at the closing price on the day I made the transaction--I believe that was Wed.-- I made the my change before 3pm -- I have not done the math on that but, if they did not cover the transaction until Friday and charged the same price, what happened to the float?
I know that you are very busy and hopefully I have covered what happened to me so that others can check their balances and protect their savings as they see fit.  I know that you agree this is something that should be reported and clarified.
Thanks in advance!
