Team,
I'm not sure what the latest discussions you've had since our last meeting, but I need to get this
concept outlined and in the hands of my customer.  They are making their decision any day now
and I believe this structure will add to the value of our Compression Service and reduce our
dependence on the minimum load factor.
I've attached a basic outline as I see it.  Please review or we will discuss at our 3:00 meeting today.
I would like to define or understand our (Enron's) wish list as well as a relative value at a minimum.
I need to get the specifics to my customer tomorrow since it's not going to happen today.
I ultimately need to have a price for the gas that ECS would be receiving ASAP.
Thanks,
mk
