The following information was provided by Cyndi Wulfson with the Outlook Migration Team.
Email Diskspace Usage Policy states that each user will be provided a Microsoft Exchange mailbox for use with Microsoft Outlook and that mailbox will be limited to a maximum storage limit of 100MB. It is important to note that the Global Messaging team had these mailbox capacity limits in Notes, however, they weren't strictly enforced. As we move to a new mail system, it is critical that all users of Email understand their responsibilities of proper Email usage, mail capacity policy enforcement and the resulting paradigm shift of how Enron utilizes eMail.
Enron has a legal retention policy that states that backup tapes of Email are kept a maximum of 8 days, items in folders older than 365 days are deleted/purged, and therefore eMail should be thought of as temporary storage. It is absolutely critical that as an Email user, we use Email as only the reception point and initiation point of mail and not as storage.
Ways of properly storing mail and mail contents are:
1.	Detach attachments to the home directory (H:\). This will decrease the overall size of one's mail file significantly. A user must be very diligent about this routine of receiving and detaching attachments to h:\.
2.	Deleting unneccessary Email from mailbox folders and mailbox system folders such as the Sent Mail folder. One would be surprised at how many times one attachment or large message is floating around in their mailbox as conversation threads.
3.	Review and follow the recommendations for conserving diskspace and customizing your Outlook mailbox for more efficient identification and viewing of mail sizes and conversation threads.
4.	Additional diskspace can be requested through the eRequest system: <http://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp>  This requires approval from the user's Vice-President or above and comes in 25 MB increments. Each 25 MB increment requires a separate eRequest and approval.
5.	Public Folders can be requested through the eRequest system: <http://itcapps.corp.enron.com/srrs/entry/srrs.asp>  Public Folders can be an additional place for shared group information, group calendars, or personal mail storage. The name Public Folders is misleading - they are essentially folders that reside on an Exchange server that can be viewed and used through Outlook. They can be given rights to a single user or many users. Public Folders still have the legal retention policy applied to them if they are used for mail storage, personal or shared.
