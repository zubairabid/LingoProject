Twenty-nine of you have said you want to play and I've got three or four
guys on the bubble that haven't received permission to play from their wives
or girlfriends.  Regardless, I reserved tee times for seven foursomes with
the first group going at 8:32 a.m. on Friday morning and the last at about
9:20 a.m. (eight minutes between each group).  I'm sure we can squeeze in
another group when the numbers round out.  I've put down an initial deposit
of $112 ($4 a head) that is only refundable for merchandise in the golf shop
or range balls (don't ask me why, but that's in the contract).  In addition,
I need checks from each of you for $48.00 by Aug. 1 (green fee, half a cart,
and $4 deposit).  Please send them to 3235 Cole Ave. #15, Dallas, 75204.  I
need to give the pro a final number and pull the trigger on the full deposit
(putting the remaining $44 per player on my credit card) by Aug. 3.  Your
check will reserve your spot and will enable me to get firm commitments from
everybody.  It will also enable me to round out the numbers and put you in
your foursomes.  Thanks; looking forward to it.
