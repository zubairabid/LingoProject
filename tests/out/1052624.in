Subject: It costs so little and means so much

As you are probably aware, if voting results in Florida stand as they
are now, George W. Bush will be our next President.
This will have catastrophic results in our vital -- no, indispensable

entertainment industry. Barbra Streisand, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon,
Whoopie Goldberg, Alec Baldwin -- among many others -- have sworn to leave
the country if George W. Bush is elected President.
And this is where YOU can help.  We need volunteers to help pack and
to
load moving vans.  We also need airfare for these irreplaceable national
treasures so they can relocate before they change their minds.
For the cost of a small SUV, you can sponsor one of these celebrities
and their unfortunate relocation.
You will know that your efforts are helping when you receive
postcards,
letters and pictures from your chosen "refugee" as they learn to become a
useful citizen in the Third World country of their choosing.
You will help, won't you?  It costs so little but it means so much.
