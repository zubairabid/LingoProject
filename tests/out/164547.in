WPTF is submitting a K-A filing.  It supports Hebert's proposal but added my
proposed language to start with $350 or $600 to encourage peakers.  The final
is attached.  Here is the Table of Contents for quick reading.  A technical
Appendix will provide lots of support for how the utilities behaved this past
summer.
A.  The Requirement to Sell Into and Buy from the PX 2
B.  The Underscheduling of Loads and Resources 4
C.  Governance of the PX and ISO 4
D.  Price Mitigation and the &Soft8 Cap 6
1.  Price Caps Are Generally Ineffective In Achieving Lower Average Energy
Prices 7
2.  Price Caps Deter Needed Investment in New California Generation 8
3.  The $150 Soft Cap Puts Power Marketers at Risk. 9
4.  How Can the $150/MWh &Soft8 Cap be Made More Palatable? 10
a. The Sunset Date Must Be Observed 11
b. The Soft Cap Should Begin at a Price Higher Than $150/MWh 11
c. The Soft Cap Should Be Escalated 12
E.  Refund Liability 12
F.  What Were The Real Causes of The Recent Price Increases? 14
1.  The Staff Report Identifies the Well Known Factors 14
2.  However, There Were Other Factors That Also Contributed Significantly to
the Higher                                          Prices Experienced in
California.
On refunds, WPTF is completely consistent with our filing. It argues:
facts do not support a claim for refunds with respect to Summer
2000 rates.
When a market clears at or below the soft cap, there should be no refund
liability for any seller unless that seller is shown to have manipulated the
market, abused market power, or colluded.
When suppliers bid and are paid at rates above the soft cap, the
definitions of marginal and opportunity costs must be clarified to recognize
how units are dispatched throughout a year, that a contribution to a
generator,s actual fixed costs must be incorporated into the equation for
marginal costs, that forward contracts contribute to the &marginal costs8 of
a sale, and that opportunity costs include broad market forces such as prices
in competing markets.
the ability to sell above marginal cost is not evidence of market power or
market abuse.
ensure that transactions above the soft cap are deemed closed and no longer
subject to refund within a reasonable time, such as one to two months.
the November 1 Order extends beyond the 15-month potential refund period
permitted by the Federal Power Act and should be shortened to conform with
the requirements of the Act.
The filing also has sections opposing load-differentiated price caps and a
return to cost-based rates.  WPTF asks FERC to clarify the election process
on the new Boards to ensure that governmental entities exert no more
political pressure.

D.  Cost Based Rates - - A Return to Regulatory Luddism
The original Luddites were bands of skilled textile workers who had been
laid-off after advances in technology replaced the need for them.  In
reaction to being laid-off, they burned mills, terrorized the owners and then
destroyed the steam and water-powered labor-saving devices that had cost them
their jobs.  The uprisings took place mainly in the center of the wool region
in England from 1811-16.  In other words, Luddites were casualties of the
English Industrial Revolution.
Ned Ludd was the movement,s mythical founder -- an apprentice who smashed his
shearing frame with a hammer.  These wooden frames were a new technology
which allowed heavy shears to be held in balance to trim a rough layer of
threads from woven cloth.  Although Ned didn,t break the machine to make a
political statement, he inadvertently became the first practitioner of
Luddism.  Thirty years later in pursuit of a naive back-to-basics theme,
Luddites organized and rioted against technological advances in the English
textile industry.  The Luddites rioted in rejection of technology that was
seen as threatening to their way of life and livelihood.
Now, in California, we have regulatory Luddites. The few parties who fall in
this old world camp once controlled the energy investments in California and
now fear the advent of competition, bemoan its reduction (or elimination) of
their previous regulatory overview and seek to smash restructuring as poor
Ned smashed his machinery.  Their arguments are reactionary, their political
tactics oppressive.
By 1816, the English government put down the Luddites with hangings and
transportation out of the region.  In the absence of such remedies today,
WPTF simply urges the Commission to hold true to its course.  and on ...
