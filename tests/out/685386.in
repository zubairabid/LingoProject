It seems that one trait of conservative thinking is to ignore sentiments
unless the first few words of their expression identifies them as similarly
conservative. It is a pity WSJ wasn't quoting Scott Simon when he was
exhorting college students to work for peace. I perceive a lot of
close-minded thinking disguised these days as being "beyond politics." Bill
O'Reilly's slogan "fair and balanced, as always" makes me gag. That the
Right has turned our national tragedy into an opportunity to gain political
ground, then deflects criticism as being inappropriately political, is the
height of hypocrisy, but is more and more becoming a touchstone for
conservatism in this country.
Yes, Simon normally espouses liberal views. But when people lose their
values, it doesn't therefore mean those values were bankrupt. David Horowitz
was a member of the Weather underground during the anti-Vietnam war
protests. Now he writes that the blood of American soldiers is on the hands
of peace activists, and articles like "The sick mind of Noam Chomsky."
People change. That's probably good. But the mere fact that someone can move
from peach activism to war mongering, though, doesn't necessarily imply
evolutionary thinking. (And reactionary zealots call talk-shows everyday,
lying that they used to be a "Clinton Democrat", or a "liberal", until this
or that terrible thing occurred recently that finally opened their eyes.)
I could not disagree more with Simon and anyone else who believes we are
doing the right thing to bomb Afghanistan, then demonizes any criticism as
showing support for terror. Sure, it makes me feel good that we might be
hurting those who committed the barbarism on September 11. I would support
this war 100% if I thought it would bring about greater justice in the
world, and greater security for America. Of course, yes, then it WOULD be
justified. To paint all those who suggest this war is a mistake as wanting
"to live in the kind of world that the terrorists who hit the World Trade
Center and Pentagon would make" and to equate what's happening now to the
1930s is infantile straw-manism.
Why did we invade Kuwait? Was it to preserve democracy? I don't think so.
Why are our troops still in Saudi Arabia? Is it to preserve justice and
freedom? I don't think so. What was the Great Game in Afghanistan? Why is it
being replayed? Is it to support the fair distribution of wealth? It doesn't
look like it to me.
There is too much going on here involving oil and economics, and too little
involving justice and democracy. And who can sincerely believe the best way
to prevent the further innocent loss of life is to bomb Afghanistan?
Wouldn't it be a lot better to cut off our $2 billion in aid to Israel until
they found a way to live peacefully in Palestine? I've studied the history.
I don't find Israel significantly more appealing than the Palestinians. What
right have we got to be so one-sided in our support in that conflict? Israel
chided us last week with appeasing the terrorists while we waited to launch
our counter-attack. I do not support bombing Afghanistan and continuing to
send money to Israel instead of INSISTING that conflict be resolved NOW.
We need to find the people responsible for the attacks, and either
hospitalize them in isolated padded cells or string them up by their private
parts. I'm no pacifist in that department. But we need even more to show
millions of poorly educated Muslims, Arabs, and others that we are a force
for good in the world. We need to reach out to our brothers and sisters all
over the third world and show them that America really believes in justice
and freedom and democracy. A billion souls live on a dollar a day. Another
billion live on two dollars a day. We, you and I, were fortunate to have
been born here and not there. But if the tables had been turned and we HAD
been born there, how would we want America, wealthy and wasteful beyond
comprehension, to act? Perhaps to lend a hand? There is a lot of evidence
that the World Bank and the IMF are not making things better for debtor
nations. Can we forgive ourselves for not helping? This question was
relevant on Sept. 10. It's relevant now. Yes, we were unjustly attacked by
madmen. They must be found and stopped. Do you really think bombing
Afghanistan is a very high priority if our goal is to make the world a safer
and better place for all people? I think that, like it or not, we are at a
stage where to make our own lives safer, more productive, and more
comfortable, we have to find a way to make the lives of all people safer,
more productive, and more comfortable.
We are not doing that. This war is not promoting that. What are we really
gaining by this war that we couldn't gain by holding back the bombs? And
what are we losing by dropping the bombs that we may have a terrible time
regaining?
