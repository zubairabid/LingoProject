Jeff,
I have just returned from U Penn recruiting and it was a very successful trip.  In response to Aziz Fakir's e-mail, he was interviewed by Christie Patrick and Chris Hilgert on 1st rounds and was passed onto 2nd rounds.  He was their top candidate.  However, during second rounds, interviewing with Jen Frazer and Sarah Mulholland, he was not passed onto SuperSaturday.  From talking to Jen and Sarah, he did not rank as high as other candidates did.
We interviewed 20 people for second rounds.  All of the candidates were top-notch and the competition was staunch.  We are bringing back 11 Analyst for Final Rounds in Houston.  I can provide you with the evaluations of Aziz and if you want to bring him down we can.
Jen also meet with Jonathan Tyburski and she feels that we should renew his offer.  I will let our office know and we will start the paperwork.
Please let me know your decision.
Thank you,
