Attached is an update of the packets that will end November, 2001.  Most of them require adjustments for rounding.  Please remind your shippers that any balances left in a packet will be cleared through their Park & Ride agreement, and they will incur a carry-over charge.

Thanks for your help.  Call if you have any questions.
