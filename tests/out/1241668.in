To EPLF and its sympathizers:   Unless the toaster is returned immediately, SADIST will commence an escalating series of  actions designed to bring all such terrorists to their knees.  We realize there may be some collateral damage, and for this we are truly sorry.  But we must end toaster terror forever.  Beginning at 0900 hours on 10 January 2002, SADIST will commence the following series of actions (each subsequent action will commence 2 hours after the preceeding sanction):
1. All deliveries of new business cards will be suspended
2. Napkins and paper towels will be removed from the kitchens
3. Post-it notes will be confiscated from all locations
4. Paper towels will be removed from all bathrooms
5. Toilet paper will be removed from all bathrooms ( Enron stock certificates will be issued for humanitarian reasons)

If the toaster still has not been returned, SADIST will be forced to remove all COFFEE FILTERS from the building, including the Energizer and Plaza Java.  Do not doubt our will to use this ultimate weapon, after all we are SADIST.
