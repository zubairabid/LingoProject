Are you wondering how to book your next vacation or time off request?  Well EXTRA (Exception Time Reporting Application) is now at your service!

Use the link below to connect in to our new vacation and time off database.  You can submit time off requests, approve time off for your subordinates and view reports on your remaining time off all in one place.

The system is easy to use... just pick the appropriate time off reason from the drop down menu; enter a start and end date (if only one day use the same date twice); for a 1/2 day indicate a.m. or p.m.; enter the total number of days off; and hit the submit button at the bottom.

Your approver will receive an e-mail asking for their approval.  All they have to do is right click on the e-mail message and hit the approve or reject button.  You will get a message back staying your request has been approved or rejected.

Please take a few moments to open the system (bookmark it for convenience) and verify your information and record any time off you've taken since January 1, 2002.   If you have any questions, please contact Tricia Henry.
