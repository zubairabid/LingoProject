Hello Sally,
I have been out of the office so I am sorry for the late reply.  I called NABA and they have filled all of their technical sessions for the conference.  However, when we participate next year we will make sure to get you slotted in a session early .  The four free conference passes includes Wes Colwell's group.  We can purchase additional conference passes if you would like to send more employees.
Thank you for you involvement.
