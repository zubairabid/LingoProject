Notice you weren't copied on this.  Paul, Paul & I have discussed and we're looking to see whether there is any further slack we can release, how much is set aside for a major case in the 2nd half of the year and when we start cutting muscle not fat.  Clearly we'll need to get Eric & Richard as our consumers to question this as their people are generally demanding more support from us, not less.  Before going to them, perhaps we can discuss this at our conference call on Monday ?
