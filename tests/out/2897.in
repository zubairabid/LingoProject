We've been waiting for this shoe to drop for a while.
Please read this notice (copied below and also attached); I will be contacting you next week for your thoughts on what Enron's position should be.
The very good news is the FERC is not asking the cap to be lowered; they are only asking to make it easier to raise it.
Regardless of our position, please be aware that this outcome of this case will likely be an increase in the probability that the cap could be raised above $91.87/MWh.
The earliest possible effective date of any change in methodology would probably be late November.

NOTICE OF TECHNICAL CONFERENCE CONCERNING
WEST-WIDE PRICE MITIGATION FOR THE WINTER SEASON
AND PROCEDURES FOR SEEKING PARTICIPATION
(October 12, 2001)
Take notice that the Commission is convening a technical conference to be held on Monday, October 29, 2001, at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, 888 First Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20426.  The Technical Conference will commence at 1:00 p.m. and will be open to all interested persons.   On June 19, 2001, the Commission prescribed price mitigation for California spot markets and markets throughout the West.   In that order, the Commission also invited interested parties to file with the Commission comments and proposals for the purpose of revisiting the mitigation methodology for future periods, if necessary.  This technical conference will address possible modifications to the current West-wide price mitigation methodology for the winter season.
As a starting point for discussions at the conference, and based on the comments that were filed, possible modifications to the current price mitigation methodology include the following:  (1) eliminate the 10 percent adder for sales into California; and (2) require the California Independent System Operator to not only recalculate the price for spot market transactions when there is a Stage 1 reserve deficiency, but also recalculate the price when the average of the three gas indices increase by 10 percent above the level last used for calculating the mitigated price (i.e., 66 cents based on the current average of $6.64/MMBtu).
Persons wishing to speak at the conference must submit a request to make a statement in the above-captioned dockets.  The request should be submitted by e-mail to David Boergers at david.boergers@ferc.fed.us (include Docket No. EL01-68-000 in the subject heading of the e-mail), and should be followed up, at the same time, with a letter to the Secretary of the Commission.
