Dear Fellow YPO'er:

YPO is such a dynamic organization because of the quality and enthusiasm of
its members.
As Membership Chairman, I feel a profound responsibility to add new members
to further
that result.  To accomplish that, the Membership Committee needs the
attention and input
of all current members.

First, be on the lookout for any new potential members.  If you identify a
potentail candidate,
please contact my office (713-966-2602 or jeff_hines@hines.com).  Second,
and vitally
important, is to receive your comments, positive or negative, on candidates
who are
proceeding through the membership process.  Attached is the bio for
potential member
Carin Marcy Barth.

The Membership Committee seeks input on these candidates for a two-week
period
following the dissemination of their bios.  Again, please refer any input
to my office.
A several word comment as a reply to this e-mail is fine.  This timely
information is
critical to the process.  Remember, we need positive feedback (as well as
negative).
Many times prospective candidates have told us they know a lot of people in
YPO,
so when we do not hear positively about them it is concerning.  All input
shared with
the Membership Committee is held in Forum confidentiality.  If you have
input that you
feel that you only want to share with me please let me know.  Input
received after this
two-week period does not help the process.  Speak now or forever....you
know the rest!

Thanks for your input.

Sincerely,

Jeff Hines
Membership Chairman
