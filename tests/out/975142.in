Not sure whether you've come across the attached article in the latest
Economist?!

<<Fading_Fads.pdf>>
If the stated survey claim is true (and BTW I don't agree with their
definition of "real options analysis"), the "message" doesn't seem to be
getting across.  I personally don't think that ROA is a fad.  However, as
Tim Luehrman has stated, we have a major "language" and "practical
application" issue.

I certainly encourage rectifying the "hopeless" message of this article by
proposing a "counter-point" article in The Economist.  In my view, ROA isn't
everything, however, it provides a powerful nucleus for the creation,
protection, and delivery of value (Navigant - thanks for your focal chart!).
We should also learn from the lessons of the other so-called "management
fads"!!
