One of the bidders on the RFP, Beachfire, will be making a presentation of
their product at our New York offices on Monday, April 23, at 4:00 p.m. I
have seen the product previously and I think it is impressive. I have
attached materials we have received from them.

The presentation is best seen in person, and I encourage you to come to our
offices. I have asked that a web connection be established so that Mark will
be able to view it from Houston. If other Board members are interested in
seeing it, please let me know. Anyone who wants to view the presentation via
the web will need to have special web conferencing software installed on
their computer (downloadable from the internet). Please have your assistant
contact Justin Itin ( jitin@isda.org <mailto:jitin@isda.org> ) who can get
you in touch with the Beachfire people who are arranging the presentation.
