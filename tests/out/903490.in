Mark,
We have been aware of this project for some time and have watched it with
interest.
Questar just (within the last month) bought the development rights fully from
Beta Energy.  They have drilled one salt test well and have extensively
tested the salt.  They HAVE NOT tested the disposal zones as yet and that is
a critical component.
They are planning on developing four caverns for a total of 14 Bcf working
gas. First caverns should be available in about 2 years.  At that time they
will abandon the three small reservoirs on their system and replace the
deliverability and services with the Yellow Creek Facility.
We have initiated conversations with them regarding providing base gas as
well as horsepower.
