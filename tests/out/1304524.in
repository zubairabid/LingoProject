Paul,
I just wanted to confirm that I understood our conversation.
We are limited to 150 MW short or long until some future date.
I understand that limit will be expanded as we gain more experience.
As an aside, I wanted to explain a little better why I felt, if not comfortable, at least not painfully uncomfortable carrying what would normally be considered a fairly large position.
1.  Off Peak is only 7 hours of exposure, meaning it is less than 1/2 the time length exposure.
2.  Off Peak PJM is historically much less volitile, than the peak period.
3.  My long position was at a fairly low price ($15)
4.  My main motivation was to get some transaction volume to get more players involved in the market.  Most of the potential counterparties I called were not used to having a market.  I had to explain how to use EOL limit orders to a number night shift counterparties.  I intentionally wanted to get them to make their first trade.  I was overzealous in my approach.
I intend to continue trying to drive volume, while taking reasonable positions, until the various players are more comfortable in the market, but will ensure I keep my exposure inside the 150 MW limit.
