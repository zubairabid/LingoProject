As a result of recent deregulation in states such as Pennsylvania and
California, many new companies are entering the retail energy market.  Today,
consumers in several states are able to choose their energy provider in much
the same way they choose their long-distance phone company.  A survey has
been commissioned by the research group to better understand which factors
are most important to consumers considering switching energy providers.

The survey consists of 28 question, and can be found on the following website:

If you, your spouse, or someone else in your family has time to take this
survey, we would appreciate your input.

consideration.
