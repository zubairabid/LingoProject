I'm not sure, but I think that Nevada may have a net metering law as well,
although the cut-off is probably less than 25 MW.  I think that a net
metering provision would be appropriate for a number of reasons, not all of
which are compelled by state renewable laws/policies. Many small wholesale
entities (at least in Utah and other east-side locations have modest
generators behind their meters and would be disadvantaged if there were no
net metering accommodations avilable.  Given the size of the generators
(generally much less than 25MW), they are not significant to the grid, but
are to their owners.
