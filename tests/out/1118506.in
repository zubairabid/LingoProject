Recently, EnronOnline has changed direction in regards to 3rd party access to EnronOnline and our technology.  We want to make sure that we are working closely with each of your desks to ensure that both of our interests are aligned.  Please be informed of two initiatives that we are working on.

Creating private label e-market places for other companies
- We are utilizing the technology that we've created for EnronOnline to create similar platforms for other companies (real time trading to inventory management).
3rd Party price posting on EnronOnline
-Essentially, we are selling licenses that allows 3rd parties to post their products onto EnronOnline.  We are targeting products that complement the current product 	set listed on EnronOnline (i.e. pipeline capacity).

Please pass this along to members of your group.  Any discussions involving our core commodities would require prior desk approval.  We are available to speak with any of your groups in more detail.  If you would like to discuss these initiatives, feel free to contact myself at 713-853-9673 or Brad Richter at 713-853-4893.

Thank You,

Dan Diamond
