Attached is a summary of several PG&E advice letters. 2057-E is protest
material, as it establishes all new rate schedules based on PG&E's
contention that the rate freeze has alreadyended. I will forward  that
advice letter to you in a separate email. Let's discuss what we want  to do
with regard to their filing. There is no date specified for  comments, but
assuming the usual 20 days, that means protests are due on  December 12.
