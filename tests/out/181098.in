I just got a call from Sandra Yamane at Marathon -- she just talked to their
client who was at the CEO meeting w/ Bush, Davis and Riordan.  Each
participant had two minutes to speak -- all focused on technology and energy
efficiency.  The media was allowed to come into the meeting at the end.
Craig Barrett emerged as the spokesman and he said the group unanimously was
opposed to price caps.  Davis said very little, and Riordan said nothing.
Davis' press conference is being televised right now on CNN.
