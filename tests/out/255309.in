Johnny, Steve and I think now would be a good time to inject a Standing Rock
type expansion since we may be narrowing the gap considerably.  Although it
would be important to provide Zaman feedback on their last offer before the
Task Force meeting on Friday, we would also like to discuss any offer in the
in the context of overall resolution of all of the issues.  Would you have
some time either before or after we meet with El Paso??
