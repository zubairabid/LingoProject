Thanks to all of you who responded.  I will briefly describe what we think
the play is based on the input provided.
Bob Hanson, Jennifer Rudolph and Roger Yang "scored" with providing the
information below.
Most likely the consultant will suggest converting accounts on AL-TOU,
AY-TOU, and AO-TOU to one of the following rate schedules: AV-1 AV-2, and
AV-3.  These are general service variable TOU rate schedules.  The purpose of
these rate schedules was to send the customer price signals to curtail during
times when the transmission system was constrained.  Like many of UDC
experimental programs, customers often did better on this rate schedule,
compared to their otherwise applicable rate schedule, even if they did not
follow the price signals.
That loop hole is being closed by SDG&E.  They have a draft decision from the
CPUC changing the distribution rate components associated with these rate
schedules, thus closing the loop hole.  Based on these changes, customers
should pay significantly more than their otherwise applicable rate schedule,
unless they follow the price signals.  If the customery follows the price
signals this program is like a curtailable program or RTP program.  The
customer would have to shut down load or use DG during high priced hours.
I expect we have not heard the last from these individuals.
Just for the record this is what we think the play is.  The consultant will
not share their strategy with the customer until after a contract is signed.
Normally the up-front consultant fee is between $8K - $15K and then a 50/50
sharing of the savings over 3 years.
SDG&E also charges a setup fee, which includes special equipment, of $4500 to
be on these AV rate schedules per account.
