Important Announcement . . .

George Wasaff is getting a haircut tomorrow at the Big E Caf!  His team has done a tremendous job and George is living up to his commitment to his team and JDRF and he will have all his hair shaved off as the center attraction for the Big E Caf.

Please spread the word and encourage everyone you know to attend.  We would love to have a huge crowd tomorrow to witness this amazing event.

In addition to watching George, everyone can get a great meal for just $5 and listen to the live band, Mango Punch.  We will also have a huge bake sale, sneaker sales, T-shirt sales, raffle tickets sales.  People will have an opportunity to sign up for the Walk and turn in their donations and walk forms.

Remember to wear your red Walk T-shirt and join us for all the activities.

Thanks.
