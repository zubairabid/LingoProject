Thank you all for being so patient with me while I am under Carla's wise
tutelage. Hopefully I'll be up to speed in the next few days, but if you
notice me doing anything insanely wrong, don't hesitate to yell.

One thing that has lagged slightly, but will be making a comeback tomorrow,
is the Deal Correction Report. Every afternoon I'll check up on discrepancies
noted by Houston and determine the source of the error. If the source of the
error is you, me, the broker, or the computer gods, it will be noted in the
error report and given to Risk Management to assist them in their daily
calculation.

Thanks again,
