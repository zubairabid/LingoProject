I will need to leave the office at 1:00.  Today the kid's school is have
their fall festival.  Because of the low number of parent volunteers, the
school just called to inform me that  all kids will be dismissed at 1:00 and
must be picked up or supervised by a parent at the festival.  I spoke with
the school principal and she will hold the boys in the gymnasium until I
arrive.
