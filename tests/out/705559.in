Inspected 3 filter cases down stream of Inlet separator at the SLX plant, all
were still clean and dry. Got a slug of liquid in the Inlet filter separator
at the SLX about 90 gallons. Did not get any further down stream, also took
sample of it. See attached for our sample results for this month. PG&E are
having problems with their phone lines so Sherwood labs could not fax their
results. Therefor I don't have their results on the spred sheet.I will send
them out as soon as I get them. Thanks,Randy
