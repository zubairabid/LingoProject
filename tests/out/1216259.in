On March 19th, the Foundation for Taxpayer & Consumer Rights published a
report in it's Bailout Watch newsletter (Special Report: The Manufactured
Energy Crisis) concluding that California's energy crisis has been
manufactured by "energy firms."  A copy of the report is attached and is also
available on the organization's website at www.consumerwatchdog.org.

Today, the Consumer Federation of America released a report (Behind the
Headlines of Electricity Restructuring: A Story of Green, Irresponsibility
