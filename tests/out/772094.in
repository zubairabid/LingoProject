Teams: Effective July 1, 2001
With the event of having to put a reason in TMS for timeline extensions and all reliability calls going to the HotTap Help Desk and being logged into Remedy, Customer Service Representatives will no longer be required to fill out the Waiver Log. Yes it is true, we can report on the timeline extensions from TMS,  Remedy will be used for the Reliability reporting so we can do away with another manual process.

Please make sure all reliability calls go through the HotTap Help Desk so they may be logged into Remedy by the Help Desk and used for reliability reporting!

Put as informative of statement in TMS as you can for timeline extensions, some have been a little brief. In your statement let us know if the timeline is extended due to TMS system problems, waiting for El Paso confirmations, Customers are experiencing problems in their system, Contracts group requested an extension for a new contract and so on. This will be our official documentation for timeline waivers in case of an audit.
If you need more examples please let me know and I will provide them to you.

If you have any questions please give me a call 37429
