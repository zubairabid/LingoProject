George,
Please see the attached list below which provides an update of Enron travelers affected by the crisis.  As you know our primary goal is to facilitate safe and timely travel.  Our agency partners continue answering requests 24 x 7 and scheduling flights/accommodations.  My staff and Travel Agency in the Park will work through the weekend until we get our travelers returned to their destinations safely.
Please contact me if you have any questions or require additional information.
