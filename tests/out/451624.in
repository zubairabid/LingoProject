Gov. Davis Plans To Enact Physics Regulations


LOS ANGELES (NAP) - Encouraged by the success of recent legislative efforts to
control the laws of supply and demand for electricity, Gov. Gray Davis
announced
today the introduction of new changes to the laws of physics.

"We've been suffering too long at the hands of pin-headed scientists and
engineers
who can't think outside the box," Gov. Davis said to an enthusiastic crowd
outside the
UC Berkeley campus.

Gov. Davis blasted opponents who called the plan to regulate basic physics
equations
"insane" and "impossible." Responded Gov. Davis, "Remember the so-called
economists who said that price controls lead to shortages.  Well, look who's
laughing now?!"

The new regulatory program is headed by Professor Eugene 'Skippy'Shepperson
of UC Berkeley, who has been dubbed the Paul Krugman of electrical
engineering.

"It's really quite astonishing. By fudging a couple coefficients and
rearranging Ohm's
law, and a couple other mandates, we can double the efficiency of our
existing power
plants with no environmental side effects. In fact, with no changes to the
infrastructure at all. It's a real win-win situation," Skippy claimed.

The regulatory program consists of legislating a decrease in the resistive
coefficient of copper and aluminum, commonly used in high tension wires.  "We
should be able to considerably cut down on transmission losses with the new
regulations. The computer models say that we shouldn't lose any electricity
at all," Skippy commented in a speech before Gov. Davis took the podium.

Keys to the program include several changes to the famous R=V/I equation,
so-called Ohm's Law. Details are still forthcoming, as Skippy's address was
cut short
when his frantic hand waving injured three bystanders.

"I can't believe we let physics get away with being unregulated for so many
years,"
declared Jeni Flowerpot of the California NIMBY Coalition. "We have some
serious gripes with chemistry and biology, as well. If we can tinker with
economics and physics, why the wait to get true pollution control and sexual
equality?" asked the CNIABEC representative.

The new regulatory program would set an interesting precedent in the state
that has
given birth to many innovative legislative efforts.  "If this program is
successful, we have plans to investigate the Second Law of Thermodynamics for
antitrust violations," Gov. Davis continued to rousing applause.

"Getting something for nothing is every Californian's right!"

Leading scientists in universities not located in California were skeptical,
however.
"I want some of what Skippy's been smoking," stated Professor Sara Powell of
Duke
University in North Carolina. "You can't change the laws of nature when you
don't
like the results. Physics isn't Calvinball."

Gov. Davis and his supporters were not swayed in their support for Skippy and
his
new ideas in the field of electrical engineering.

"If this program does fail, we'll have only the greedy out of state electric
companies to blame. Everybody knows that they rake in excessive profits when
they don't sell electricity," Gov. Davis replied.
