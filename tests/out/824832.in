I just wanted to give all of you an update to my previous message on the
replacement for Brian Heinrich in Financial Operations.  Jennifer Blay was
going to be his replacement; however, Jennifer has accepted a position in
Energy Operations working for Jeff Sorenson.  The newest addition to the
Financial Operations staff is Holly Heath who joins us from Bank United.  She
is located at EB-2419A and can be reached at Ext. 3-5843.  In addition, Sarah
Brown will transfer as Manager of the Consolidated Reporting Team from the
Gas and Transmission Assets Team in the Business Analysis and Reporting
organization.  Sarah is located at EB-2419B and can be reached at Ext. 3-3417.

Brian will be helping to transition Holly into her new responsibilities.  As
such, you will be receiving E-mails from Brian during the next week or so.
After that, Holly will begin to request information directly from you.

Please join me in welcoming both Holly and Sarah into their new roles.
Thanks for your patience during the next few weeks.  If you have any
questions, please do not hesitate to call me.
