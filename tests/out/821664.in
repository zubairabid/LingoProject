Thanks for your response.  Brian Dawson had them.
FYI...per Brian's question/suggestions I will be implementing a file check out policy procedure for our files that will help control their whereabouts.  Starting with the E-schedules and tax files there will be an additional hanging file folder inside the cabinet with sign out forms inside.  Everyone will be expected to govern themselves accordingly for file usage.  Thanks for your cooperation.
