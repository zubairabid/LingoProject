Please see Harry's note below.  I asked him to review the tariff for NIMO to validate their formula.  It appears similar to the formula NIMO is using and discussed with us; however, could you please review.  (especially the 75 heating degree days).

Dave and I have spoken with contacts at NIMO and have reduced the requirement to $3.6MM by removing a couple of counterparts which will come out of the pool Dec 1st.  MDQ was validated by the desk.  The real driver seems to be the requirement and the assumption of no gas delivery for 30 days by EES at the most extreme temperature.
