Attached is a list of all packets ending October 2001.  Most need adjustments because of rounding, however, there are some that need additional adjustments before month end.   Any balance left at the end of the month will be transferred to their Park & Ride contract.

These are the shippers that need special attention:

Aquila	#108027 and #108028
ENA	#106875 and #107822
NSP	#107664 (needs to up their injection to 4,331/day to be at zero at month end)
Occidental	#106850
Reliant	#107030
Tenaska #107947

Thanks for your help.
