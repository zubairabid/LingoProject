With all due respect "Judge" that is not the issue in this case.  Calling
911 because some chick tries to use a fake ID???  Does Chuy's call 911 every
time a minor tries to buy a drink?  Of course not.
By the way, I live in Austin and have eaten at Chuy's many times and can
testify first hand to the fact that I have seen many people drinking their
who were obviously not yet 21.  The manager of Chuy's took a stand on the
issue?  Jesus, give me a break!!
