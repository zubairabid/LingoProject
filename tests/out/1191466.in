Jane:
This responds to your questions relating to the gambling issues for weather
derivatives which we discussed last week.  This advice is based on discussions
with Naoaki Eguchi and Shinji Toyohara.  We have tried to provide a practical
response to all of the issues raised.  If you need further discussion on the
theoretical underpinnings, please let me know.
As background, the main advice to date on this issue has been our initial
advice
of January 14, 2000, a memorandum to John Viverito dated July 7, 2000 and an
email to John Viverito dated July 13, 2000.
Question 1: (Can/Should ToaRe and Enron Japan give a mutual representation
to the effect that they are each entering into the transaction "to hedge
weather
related risks arising in the ordinary course of [their] business".  If not,
can
the representation be deleted or amended?)
ToaRe has taken the position that it is a "risk
taker" in this transaction and that, accordingly, it cannot give the
representation because it is not hedging risk.  Similarly, Enron Japan does
currently have weather exposure in Japan and, accordingly, cannot be said to
be
hedging weather risk.
It follows, that the representation, as
currently drafted, does not fit the actual circumstances of either party and
needs to be modified or deleted.
Our recommendation would be to modify the
representation as follows:
(a) each party represents to the other that
it understands the transaction, it is entering into the transaction in the
ordinary course of its business and that it has a legitimate business purpose
for entering into the transaction;
(b) ToaRe represents to Enron Japan that it
has the power and authority to enter into the transaction under the Insurance
Business Law.
The modification to paragraph (a) removes the
word "hedge" which would have been problematic to both parties, but retains
the
basic concept that this is a  commercial transaction within the ordinary scope
of business of both parties.  We understand that Enron Japan's business
purposes
allow Enron Japan to engage in weather derivative transaction.  We also note
that the Financial Law Board (Paper on Derivatives Transactions and Gambling,
issued on November 29, 1999; the Financial Law Board is an unofficial
organisation of legal practitioners) has stated that a company that enters
into
derivative transactions as a business may be able to argue that it has a
legitimate business purpose in entering into the transactions - particularly
where the parties to the transaction are sophisticated and the transactions
are
conducted within reasonable parameters.  Based on these factors, we believe
that
Enron Japan should be able to give both representations.  However, Enron Japan
should note that the issue is not entirely clear under Japanese law and there
remains a remote possibility that a Japanese court might determine that Enron
Japan did not have a legitimate business purpose in entering into the
transaction.
The representation in paragraph (b) is based on
the provisions of the Insurance Business Law that enable insurance companies
(including Japanese reinsurance companies) to enter into certain types of
derivative transactions.  We understand that the FSA has provided informal
guidance to certain financial institutions to the effect that the provisions
allowing financial institutions to enter into financial derivatives are wide
enough to also allow financial institutions to enter into weather derivatives.
However, this is a matter that ToaRe would need to confirm with the FSA
directly, and we are not able to express a general view - all that is possible
is for Enron Japan to request the representation from Toa Re.
Please note that in cases where Enron Japan's
counterparty is a manufacturing company, the representation, as originally
drafted, should be given by the counterparty.
Question 2:  (Exposure for Enron Japan).
As discussed in our earlier advice, the issue of whether weather
derivatives constitute gambling under the Japanese Criminal Code is not clear,
and we are not able to provide a definite opinion on these issues.
There are two defenses to an allegation of gambling under the Criminal
Code:  "acts in accordance with law" and "legitimate business purpose".  In
principle, each counterparty must be able to show that one of the defenses
applies to it.  There is at least a suggestion in the Financial Law Board
paper
that if the "act in accordance with law" defense applies to one party, the
counterparty should also be able to rely on this defense.  However, this
argument does not have judicial support, and the more conservative position is
to ensure that each party meets one or more of the defenses.
In this case, looking at each defense in turn:
(a) ToaRe is a reinsurance company and will
be entitled to rely on the provisions of the Insurance Business Law to argue
that entering into a weather derivative transaction is an act in accordance
with
law, and thus does not constitute gambling; and
(b) it is arguable that, consistent with the
comments of the Financial Law Board discussed above,  both ToaRe and Enron
Japan
have a legitimate business purpose in entering into the transaction on the
basis
that:
* each party is carrying on a business of trading weather risk;
* each party is a sophisticated investor (as Enron Japan is a new company,
it would need to rely on the experience of Enron Japan traders previously
located offshore to show "sophistication"); and
* each party (at least in the case of Enron Japan) is conducting the
transaction in accordance with reasonable parameters.
Accordingly, assuming that ToaRe is able to give
the representations referred to above, and that these representations are
correct, both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b) appear to apply.  Thus, we do
not
believe that the risk for Enron Japan in entering into this transactions with
ToaRe will be any higher than would have been the case if Enron Japan had
entered into the transaction with a legitimate end user (for example an air
conditioning company).  We have previously characterised this risk as being
"relatively low".
It is conceivable that Enron Japan may, in the
future, enter into transactions with entities that are neither financial
institutions nor end users (for example, other traders like Enron itself would
fall into this category).  In such a case, Enron Japan will not be able to
rely
on the "act in accordance with law" argument, and will be obliged to rely only
on the "legitimate business purpose" argument based on the fact that the
counterparty is a trader of financial products.  In our view, the risk for
Enron
Japan in this scenario would increase, but could still be characterised as
being
"relatively low".  In this situation, Enron Japan and the counterparty would
give mutual representations to the effect of the representation set out in
paragraph (a) under Question 1 above.
Question 3: (Criminal Sanctions)
From a technical point of view, criminal
sanctions apply only to individuals, and not to companies.  In this case, the
criminal sanctions (if any) for gambling could potentially apply to the trader
that entered into the transaction.  The responsible managers may also have
criminal liability on the basis that they controlled the acts of the trader,
or
solicited the acts of the trader.
The penalties are:
Simple gambling  - up to Yen 500,000 fine
Habitual gambling - imprisonment up to 3 years;
Booking - imprisonment of between 3 months and 5
years.
Question 4: (Conducting the transactions using an Enron affiliate located
outside Japan)
As noted in section 5 of our July 7, 2000 memorandum, we consider that
the risk that the activity constituted gambling would be reduced if Enron were
to enter into weather transactions from offshore.
Embedded in the foregoing comments is the concept that the representations in
the GTC's need to vary depending on whether the counterparty is a financial
institution, another unregulated trader or an end user of weather derivatives.
The representations previously proposed were proposed on the basis that the
counterparty would be an end user. If appropriate, we would be happy to
provide
alternate forms of representations for your reference.
Please let us know if you have any questions.
