We plan to send the attached to about 100 of our CA customers tomorrow,
offering to extend the terms of their agreements at an indexed price.  Please
review asap and let me and Kevin know if you have any concerns.  I can be
reached over the weekend at 713 302 9089.

I have attached the letters for EES and EEMC customers, but they are
identical.  Thanks.  MDS
