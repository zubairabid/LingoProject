Just a reminder - timesheets need to be approved by 10:00 A.M. on Tuesday,
February 15.  This is necessary in order to meet the Payroll deadline of
exporting time to ETA (the Corporate payroll system), which is NOON on
Wednesday, February 16.  Any timesheets that are not approved by the 10:00
Tuesday deadline will automatically be approved by the Energy Operations
Timesheet Coordinator.

FYI - For the payroll period ending 1/31, there was only 1 timesheet
outstanding at the established deadline.  In the past, there have been as
many as 100 (which represents a little more than 25% of the Energy Operations
headcount).  Thanks for your help and support.  I know that the Assistants
all appreciate your help in meeting this deadline.

A lot of you may not be affected by Project Hurricane.  If you don't know
anything about it, then you probably aren't affected by it!  In any event, we
have set up 2 new E-work orders in the Org Database for Project Hurricane.
They are as follows:

E-HURR (should be used to capture all time spent on the ongoing support for
Project Hurricane)
E-HSET (should be used to capture all set-up costs)

Both of these work orders are set up and can be used for the 2/15 pay
period.  However, the following steps must be taken for your employees to use
the ATES system and code their time to these work orders:

MANAGERS - Identify employees within your RC that will need to charge time to
either or both of these work orders.  Please let your Assistants know who
these employees are.
ASSISTANTS - Based on the information you receive from your managers, you
must add 1 or both of the work orders to each employee's profile in the Org
Database so that they are able to charge time to the work order in ATES.
ASSISTANTS - For each Time Site you are responsible for, you must be sure to
add this information to ETA.  If you aren't sure how to handle this, please
contact Kim Perkins ASAP at x3-5304.

Thank you in advance for your cooperation in getting timesheets processed in
a timely manner.  Please be sure to share this information with your staff if
you haven't already done so.  If you have any questions on the timesheets or
the work orders, please contact me at x3-6343.
