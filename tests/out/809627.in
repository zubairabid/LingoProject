1. ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction
from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until
further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the
production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There
are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES
will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool
until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in
their pool beginning July 2000.

2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.


Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the
system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force
Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd
volume.
