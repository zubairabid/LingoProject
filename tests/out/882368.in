This really only takes 30 seconds.  See below.

I just did it!  It's fast and easy.  So no excuses for not getting soup
donated.  All of you have 1 minute to spare! People in New York and DC are
going to be having to hit foodbanks hard. There will be a need in NY for
the soup.  Below is an easy way to help....

Campbell's is donating a can of soup to area foodbanks just by clicking on
a football helmet at their website. Now, I know there are some pretty
diehard football fans out there.

Let's see which team gets the most support and help some hungry people,
too! It's quick, easy, and can be done once a day.  To date Steelers have
about 240,000 cans donated - Green Bay has over 254,000.

The Broncos only have 61,000.  Come of Fans, kick in your support.

Here is a hyper link to directly connect you to their website. Just click
on this web address:  http://www.chunky.com/click_for_cans.asp
then click on your favorite team's helmet and Campbell will donated a can
of soup.  That is it!  Please pass this to a friend or 2,3,4...
