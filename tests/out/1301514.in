"The Diary of Anne Frank"
(Newly Adapted by Wendy Kesselman)
Recommended for 5th grade up

On July 6, 1942, Anne Frank and her family were forced into hiding in a secret annex.  She took her most valuable possession with her - a small red and white plaid diary.  For over two years, Anne wrote about her life in hiding, the war and her hopes for the future.  This new adaptation retells the harrowing, true story of two families forced to hide from the world, three adolescents struggling to find their own identities with WWII raging around them and the courageous people who risked their lives to protect their very existence.

Anne's father was the only survivor of the Frank family from the concentration camps of WWII.  He edited her diary before her story was previously told.  This adaptation is Anne Franks' unedited diary.
