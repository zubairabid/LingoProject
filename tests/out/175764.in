All:
Please see attached materials from Steve Kean.  Ken Lay and Steve Kean met
yesterday with the Governor of California and his policy director to discuss
solutions to California's energy problems. The meeting was very
constructive.  Ken Lay and Steve offered some of Enron's proposed solutions
and the Governor discussed the options he's considering.  We've been asked to
provide--by Tuesday--feedback on his proposals.  The turn-around time is
tight, particularly in light of the holiday.  We'll need your feedback by COB
Monday.  If at all possible, if folks can group their feedback, comments and
suggestions and foward them along to me, that would be very helpful.  If
there is anyone else that you think ought to receive this information, please
forward along.  Thanks very much for you help.
