This thing's been floating around the web for a while.  Show's what's wrong
with good ol' California.  To wit:
We want federal water subsidies so we can kill the fish and grow rice and
grapefruit in the desert ("and we'll keep it all for us?").
Let's drive our freakin' gas-guzzlin' SUVs all over, but hey, who needs to
invest in roads; and somebody else come quick and clean up our air from all
those emissions.
And we're 49th in the nation for spending on education.  Great stuff.
Now, we've decided we want other state's with less sophisticated people (in
places like Nevada, Montana, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico) to build power
plants (and pollution) in their states to feed electricity, and dam their
rivers and kill their salmon so that we can heat our hot tubs and STILL pay 3
cents a kilowatt hour.
And oh, by the way, it's federal taxes and the military industrial complex
which has funded CA's weapons industry and communications industry.  As no
big fan of the military industrial comples, I'm just crying crocodile tears.
Generally the kind of self-righteous doo-doo that turns people off to what is
an otherwise great place to be.
Yours in tender diatribes,

PS Scott, I think that you're absolutely right:  drilling in the Arctic
Refuge in good for America....
