ALUMNI MESSAGE FROM:
MIKE CORTINA '95
I would like to gather the names,addresses, phone numbers and e-mail
addresses of all past-presidents so that we can possibly coordinate more
alumni support for the Delta Lambda chapter.  The idea is to have the
past-presidents contact only the Brothers from their respective graduating
class so as to not inundate anyone with too much work.  Any past-president
who is interested in helping with this project should e-mail me at
mcortina@zrfmlaw.com.  C, F & S  Mike Cortina, Past-President, Class of '95.
