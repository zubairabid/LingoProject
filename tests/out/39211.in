Jay,

If a deal is killed it poses a problem for us in Unify if there are any paths associated with the deal; therefore, we request the deals be zeroed out.  Call me if this is a problem.  Also, we would appreciate further details on why these deals are being killed.

In addition, I have copied Rita and Mark from Volume Management for their input.

Regards,

Tammy
