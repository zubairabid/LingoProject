Loren/Larry, we have been trying to locate a Marketer for Post Rock for some time now.  Post Rock is now our only hold-out that has not signed their extension agreement so that we could send them their Rate Case Refund invoices that are dated 9/1/1999 so becuase of that, all of those invoices are still sitting on our accounts receivable account plus they have not yet paid their Reservation invoices for
Nov. 2000 thru March 2001.  The Market Service Rep (Randy Janzen and Harry Woodson) was going to call them to today to find out why they hadn't paid their Reservation invoices but we may need help from Marketing to see if we can get this extension agreement signed.  Please let me know if you have talked with anyone at Post Rock and if you need anything from our group.

Thanks,

Raetta
