Attached please find a draft of a Govt Affairs Update that Tim Belden has
asked us to keep (Mary Hain has worked on it).  It will help the Desk and our
group keep up with what is going on.  I've asked Marcie Milner to try and
manage the report (but everyone needs to update their stuff).  We can talk
about this at our next meeting.  If you have comments on format, etc. please
let Marcie know.

PS Marcie , this has some changes that weren't on the last one.
