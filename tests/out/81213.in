After numerous complaints and consulting with past  commissioners.  I have decided that the best interest in the league is to  leave the waiver policy unchanged.  We will continue to operate by the same  rules as in years past.  All players CAN be claimed on a first come  first served basis, after waiver transactions complete on Friday at 9am in their  pre determined order.  Therefore, players WILL NOT be frozen until the  following weeks transaction period.  If there is a need for a rule change,  we can put it to vote next year.  Please attempt to make all transactions  via the web site in the future.  If you have difficulty, then email me with  your transaction.  All players that were dropped last week are now  available to be claimed on a first come, first served basis.

For those that are new or may have forgotten, there  is a $2 fee/transaction that will be due at the end of the season.  All  money from waiver transaction will go to the FFL Bowl  champion.

Sorry for all the confusion.

Kevin
