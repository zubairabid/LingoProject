As discussed during our recent demonstration of our new portfolio tracking system (PortRAC), we have completed a security system that will provide a "firewall" controlling access to each business unit's data.  Our intent is to open up the system to designated members of each business unit or others as approved by the COO or Managing Director of that group.

In order to complete the initial setup, we need to receive a listing of approved users for your business unit and their login Id's. If you prefer to delegate security approval authority to someone else on your staff, please let us know and we will establish procedures with them.

If additional demonstrations of PortRAC are necessary for your group, please let us know.

Thank you for your assistance.          Rick C.
