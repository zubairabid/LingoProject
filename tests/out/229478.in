Tax:
The Enron entity executing the FX transaction as principal is ENA.
However, note that for tax/legal the FX desk in London is run by Enron Europe
Finance & Trading Limited ("EEFT") as agent for ENA. Our position is that ENA
does not have a place of business in London. Therefore all the transactions
managed by the London FX desk are arranged by EEFT as agent for ENA.
Because of this there is a need to identify which FX desk arranged the
transaction and a possible solution to this is to have separate logins and
logoffs for each FX desk during their hours of responsibility. This would
enable transaction reports to be run which identify those transactions which
took place during the period for which each FX desk was responsible for
managing the FX positions.
