Just a note to let you know how the Focus Group meeting went last Friday....

There were approximately 10 employees and two HR facilitating the meeting and taking notes. All but two were from outside the P/L Group. As I understand it, the group I was in was one of several groups HR met with on Friday. The meeting lasted an hour.  The group was asked for their opinions and observations through a series of questions. Some of the questions were as follows.....I didn't take notes so the questions below may not be worded exactly as asked but are similar.....

What should happen to Enron's Management? Should any be retained or should the Enron start fresh with new management team. What about Board of Directors?

Enron had a set of values according to which it professed to operate....Which values should be retained and which discontinued?

What does Enron need to provide in order to retain its employees? What gauge should be used to evaluate improvement over the next 6 to 12 months?

Communication has been raised as an issue in other groups. What information and what is the best means to communicate to employees?

There was a lot of venting in the group. People were angry and wanted answers to their concerns. There were no answers offered by HR to any issues and/or concerns raised by the group. HR just took note of what was discussed.

HR did indicate that more meeting will be held in the future.
