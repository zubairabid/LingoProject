FW: Dr. Seuss (Don't delete)
Just do this!
My best friend just did this, this morning, wished for her

promotion and
just got a call and she got it.
The last time I sent this exact e-mail out, I got a new job and

now I'm
superstitious.

Start thinking something you really really want, because this

is
astounding... the person that sent
this to me said their wish came true 10 mins after they read

the mail so
I thought what the heck.

Make your wish when the count down is over.

MAKE A WISH

Send this to 10 people within the hour you read this.
If you do, your wish will come true.

If you don't, it will become the opposite.
