It is imperative that we have our books flat by 6:00 a.m..  This problem is
not going to go away.  We need to make sure that before we go home no matter
what shift you are working that these books are flat, NO EXCUSES.  Everyone
must contribute and be aware of keeping all the books flat.  Day shift should
have all their positions flat and if not flat, you need to leave the night
shift with proper information so that they can flatten out the position.
Night shift should run the scheduling activity report for each region and
make sure that every book is flat by 6:00 a.m.  AGAIN THERE ARE NO EXCUSES.
