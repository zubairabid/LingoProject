Brenda, for future transactions wherein swaps are involved, please see that
extra copies of executed swaps are made at closing so that copies may be
immediately distributed to the applicable confirmation desks.  Since this
aspect of the structured finance transactions include "trading" transactions,
the confirmation desks need the paperwork immediately for their reference and
audit trails and to avoid confusion with deal tickets etc.  Please forward
this memo to the other paralegals and attorneys in your group.  For your
reference, at this time the distribution of executed copies should be
provided as follows depending upon the nature of the swaps:
Laurel Adams:  Interest Rate Swaps
Larry Joe Hunter and Bob Bowen:  Gas Commodity Swaps
Derek Bailey:  Crude Oil Swaps
Melissa Murphy:  Power Swaps
Dianne Seib:  Canada Swaps
Swap Trading Attorney:  as applicable to the attorney who assisted
