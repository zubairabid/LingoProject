To prepare for the simulation test that will run this week, can you please make sure the necessary people in your group have the appropriate access to the UBS application to perform their job function.  For example, I know that the Reports application was used by most groups and that the risk groups also used the Bridge Monitor application.
Although we are not expecting any problems to arise, please let me know of any issues your group has logging onto the system.  Thank you for your help!
