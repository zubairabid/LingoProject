Tom -- Good point.  I am glad that you came to this conclusion.  The way the
contract is written now provides that MDEA can do term deals on their own
with third parties.  Our profit calcs are covered.  On the other hand, MDEA
does not have the ability to do hourly and daily type deals with third
parties.  We can talk about this aspect and I can give you the reasons for
doing it this way.  In referring to the way the contract is written, take
that comment with a grain of salt since we have not finished the contract,
and a lot of areas like this may need work by our side (commercial) so that
Kay can finish the doc.  Thanks -- David
