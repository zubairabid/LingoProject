Attached is a letter Marathon drafted to send to the top 100+ CA businesses
in our database giving them info on our "comprehensive solution."  Rather
than attach the solution document as is, I'd recommend a shorter, simplified
version, plus an overview page that answers "What does this do for:
customers?  the state?  utilities?  marketers/generators?"
Also, what is it we want these business leaders to do?  Do we want them to
write/call/weigh-in w/ their legislators and the governor?  Do we want them
to be signatories on a formal proposal?
Please let me know what you think.
Thanks.
