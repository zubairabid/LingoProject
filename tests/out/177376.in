Jeff,
In order for California to "shut its doors" it must open its
interconnections with the rest of the west and become a Texas-like electrical
island.  This they cannot do.  California has a substantial investment in
units located in Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.  The lights would go
out in California if they opened the ties.  In the 1970's there was a hue and
cry over loop flow, with California claiming that it was being injured by
others, particularly by the interior systems trading practices, however they
never considered opening the ties, because the benefits of interconnection
were so large that the "cost" of loop flow was far exceeded by the value of
regional trade, i.e., they are economically interdependent.
If such a foolish thing were done and California full "closed its doors" by
opening its ties, cost would go up in the Northwest, in California and all
the rest of the Western System.  There are "gains for trade" which accrue to
all parties from interconnection.  The trade is more complicated than just
summer/winter peaks (seasonal load diversity) there is also seasonal resource
diversity (Spring run off effects) and finally there opportunity to
capitalize on storage vs base load thermal operations.  I will address the
last point first to illustrate the complexity of the trading patterns.
The interior west (Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico) has large
amount of base load coal plants.  As load drops off in those areas, the
energy flows to the coast to back off peaking plants and to back off hydro.
The reduction of hydro production allows night time reservoir refill which
can be used to meet peak load in the Northwest and California.  This can be
seen in the attached file, which contains a set of plots for hourly flow on
the Pacific DC Intertie Jun97, Dec 97, Jun 98, Dec 98, Jun 99, Dec 99,
Jun00.  In these plots the clear day/night exchange of energy can be seen,
especially in the Jun00 plot when sales are being made to California in the
day and to the Northwest at night.  This day to night storage exchange
benefits lowers costs for everyone.
On top of this daily/weekly cycle, there is the seasonal shift in load
diversity you noted.  For the Northwest, its peak load occurs when energy
production is the lowest -- during the winter.  As a stand alone system, the
Pacific Northwest (i.e., the Columbia Drainage area) is energy constrained.
The hydro in that area does not produce enough energy to meet annual needs.
There is plenty of generating capacity to meet any peak, but not enough to
total water flow.  Energy imports from Wyoming and Montana (e.g. Colstrip and
Bridger) are required to allow the Pacific Northwest to meet its annual
energy requirement.  With these energy inputs from the coal fields, the
seasonal water budget can be arranged to get the most value out of the hydro
system, although fish, navigation, irrigation, etc. impose an increasing
number of constraints.  Energy imports from in the winter from the South help
to meet this energy balance during the winter so water can be reserved until
the snow pack is better know in early Spring.  Some of the sales to the
Northwest from California during the winter are a result of displacement from
Desert Southwest energy moving through California and then up the Interties
to the Northwest.
Finally, the Spring run off/fish flush when production on the river is at a
maximum and load in the Northwest is down.  The sale of these surpluses paid
for the Pacific Intertie lines and remain important to the entire system.
Much system maintenance of base load units has been historically been planned
to take advantage of this factor.  Again both California and the Northwest
benefit from this trade.
In all cases, the parties would be worse off if the ties were open and
everyone was on their own.  The Northwest may be capacity long, but it is
typically energy short, even in flush hydro years.  The winter energy imports
from the South hold Northwest costs down just as spring run off sales to the
South lower energy costs in California.  California cannot craft a solo
solution that ignores the rest of the West.  It is probably hard to decide
who would be worst off if California "closed its doors".  It is only clear
that total cost would rise in both California and the rest of the West from
which it divorced itself.
I hope this rambling response comes at the question you raise.
