Just to follow up on James's note of yesterday - my apologies for being out
The elimination of the requirement to 'grab' the FX and IR market environment
from Houston ( and consequently use European data ) can improve our ability
to kick the overnight batch processing off earlier in the evening. James and
I will be working with Brian Hudson to determine the timetable for effecting
this change
The revised batch start time would improve the opportunity to detect any
system failure and complete a rerun of the valuation process so as to deliver
completed results by the time the Risk Management team arrive at their desks
in the morning. System failures are the most significant problem we face in
delivering timely information to Houston. Consequently the probability of
meeting current reporting deadlines would be greatly improved given that we
will have full IT overnight support covering for any IT failure and curve
input validation processes on trade date.
Indeed given the successful completion of all overnight runs we are able to
deliver
Officialisation of all valuation systems and most spreadsheets ( David Hardy
is in final testing of the Eastern spreadsheet feed ) by the 10 AM deadline (
Houston 4 AM )
Flash p&l by the 1PM deadline ( Houston 7AM )
Completion of the final DPR to be submitted to Houston by the 5 PM deadline (
Houston 11AM )
James and I are currently finalising a document reviewing all possible
changes to business processes that could improve these times. This is in
addition to working with Commercial and IT to assess the possibility of
delivering significantly faster revaluation systems that could assist in
delivering a trade date control process.
I can confirm that there is significant work to do in this area, however, we
are dedicated to meeting the objectives of improved/more real time control.
Please feel free to call if the above requires any additional commentary.
Regards
