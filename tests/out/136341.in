Alliant Energy's WP&L Experiences Winter Power Supply "Close Call"

MADISON- Dec. 12, 2000- Wisconsin Power and Light Co. (WP&L), Alliant
Energy's Wisconsin utility subsidiary, experienced a power supply "close
call" Monday evening. The company appealed to customers for voluntary
conservation measures and exercised its interruptible customer contracts to
maintain system reliability.

"While we have heard regular reports of this type of situation occurring over
the past few days in California, this is the first time we have appealed to
customers for emergency conservation measures in the winter," says Bill
Harvey, president, Alliant Energy - WP&L. Harvey says the lack of electric
generation supply in Wisconsin coupled with limited transmission import
capabilities continues to put Wisconsin's power supply at risk. "There is
very little cushion available, which makes dealing with emergencies like we
had last night very challenging, and potentially very dangerous," says Harvey.

At approximately 7:00 p.m. last night, 300 megawatts of generation supply
went off-line at WP&L's South Fond du Lac plant due to a fuel intake problem.
The loss of this generation represented approximately 12.5% of WP&L's total
Wisconsin generation capacity. High electric demand within the state and a
constrained transmission system made obtaining replacement power virtually
impossible. WP&L declared a system emergency, exercised its interruptible
contracts and appealed to the public for voluntary conservation. The
emergency status resulted in freeing up transmission capacity. WP&L was then
able to bring on-line additional peaking capacity and obtain power from
outside the state. Customer conservation efforts also played an important
role in avoiding more serious power supply consequences.

"Thanks to our customers who conserved electricity last night and the hard
work from our power supply team overnight, we are back to normal this
morning," says Harvey. Harvey notes that winter power supply problems are
rare, but are potentially much more serious and difficult to manage than
summer problems. The circumstances surrounding last night's problems were
particularly challenging. "The snow storm caused many businesses to shut down
early, so we knew there was not going to be a great deal of power to be saved
by exercising our interruptible contracts," says Harvey. "We appreciate the
conservation efforts of our customers last night who turned off holiday
decorative lights, delayed laundry and running their dishwasher."

WP&L and other Wisconsin utilities keep a percentage of their total
generation, called spinning reserve, operating beyond what is required to
meet current demand to deal with potential emergencies. With the loss of the
300 megawatts of generation from the South Fond du Lac plant last night,
WP&L's spinning reserves dropped below safe levels, prompting the emergency
actions. "Issuing a public appeal and exercising our interruptible contracts,
while unusual, was a prudent and conservative course of action given the
weather conditions," says Harvey. The fuel intake problem at the South Fond
du Lac plant has been resolved and WP&L's system has returned to normal
operations today.

Over the last several days, the one transmission line connecting Wisconsin to
power supplies in the west has been operating a maximum capacity, providing
little or no ability to import additional power into the state. Local
opposition to additional natural gas-fired and wind powered generation has
delayed the construction of new in-state power sources. Harvey says the lack
of new infrastructure results in a very troubling situation.

"The consequences of rotating blackouts in the winter are very serious,
particularly with weather as harsh as we are currently experiencing," says
Harvey. "Last night presented yet another clear indication of why Wisconsin
needs to move forward, and do so quickly, to ensure the construction of
needed additional electric infrastructure."
