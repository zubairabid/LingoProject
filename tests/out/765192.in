to Rambo in Mansfield/South Dallas
My e-mail was in response to all the ones i've received lately.
Did i criticize the public displays ? i just said i didn't
understand them.  Whatever floats your boat, G.
I'd like to further emphasize one point.
On a INDIVIDUAL basis, Americans are the most compassionate and
good-hearted people i've personally come across  (much more than
the Europeans - i was there, i saw - and much, much more, i hate
to say, than us)  We are all refugees, and all of us have been
helped along the way, if not with $10,000 in cash (lol), but on a
personal level, by kind, compassionate people. The scale of blood
and money donations we are seeing now can never be approached
anywhere else in the world.  And not just in this extreme, tragic
case, this has always been true.  The Marshall Plan, earthquakes
in Turkey, floods in Bangladesh, etc... Americans have always been
there to help, if not in manpower, at least in cash donations. In
the immortal words of you-know-who, Americans are good people.
However, good people do not patriots make.
Where were the patriots when, after Pearl Harbor, the
resolution in Congress to enter WWII passed by ONE vote ? Were the
patriots, those people who lined up the streets of Washington and
claimed that F.D.R. was a warmonger, a traitor, and a Jew-lover ?
Were they patriots, those young men and women ("the flower of
America's youth") who insulted and spat at the Vietnam Veterans
who returned home ? Let us not argue the merits of the (illegal)
war in VN. But shouldn't patriots at the very least show support
for their troops ?
Were they patriots, those companies which, during the height of
the Iran hostage crisis, tried to deal with the enemy and make a
profit ? (Marc Rich was not an isolated case)
In the next few weeks, will people try to dump their stocks in
the hope of making a killing or cutting their losses ?  (Greyhound
stocks anyone ?)  Continenetal has already laid off 12,000 people,
couldn't they have waited, and don't you believe they wanted to
make the cuts all along but jumped on the opportunity ?
America at its heart is a nation of self-interest - money.
It goes to war in the name of that self-interest, not in the name
of IDEALS (the Gulf War was meant to defend and save the poor,
little Kuwaitis...rite...)  That self-interest makes America rich
and strong - and all the more power to them, we all want to be
rich and strong.  The question is, will its people die for it?
Hopefully, we'll never find out - no one wants a fukkin' war.
I just wonder (WONDER, not question, criticize, or judge) if the
same Joe Smith who is screaming for war rite now on CNN, in a few
months' time, after the grief and justifiable anger have died
down, will he be so willing then to drop everything and go to war,
HIMSELF, on the GROUND in Pakistan or Afghanistan.  Once more,
Buddha saves us, we'll never find out.
PS
I claim that if i win the $10,000,000 Lotto jackpot, i will
donate half of it to chairty. With my TRACK RECORD, would you
wonder my resolve ?  How dare you ?  Joe Smith does have a track
record too.
