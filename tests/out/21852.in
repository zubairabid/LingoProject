BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Metals Branding
Work to re-position MG as Enron Metals is well underway in the UK and will
shortly be underway at Enron Metals offices around the world.  Any member of
staff who has a question about branding or name changes should contact Fiona
Grant in Public Relations.

Croatia
The mid-term power sales agreement between Enron and Croatian utility HEP is

conference in Zagreb.  Enron is also participating in the annual Zagreb Trade
Fair this week.

Enron Broadband Ventures (EBV), the investment arm of Enron Broadband
Services, announced its first investment in Europe this week.  As part of a
consortium of venture capital funds, EBV is helping provide development
funding for Interxion, a Dutch Internet infrastructure provider.  Interxion
operates a growing number of carrier-neutral Internet exchanges (IECs) in
Europe and is planning to develop new centres in Madrid, Milan, Zurich,
Munich, Helsinki and at Hilversum in the Netherlands.  "This investment is
part of our strategy to invest in emerging communications and technology
companies where EBV can leverage EBS's knowledge and resources" explained
Andrew Marsden, European Head of Enron Broadband Ventures.


A TECHNOLOGY UPDATE FROM IT'S MARK PICKERING. . .

Sametime, a new communication tool, is coming to screens across Europe and,
in the future, throughout Enron's offices worldwide.   What is Sametime? It's
a simple tool that integrates with Lotus Notes to allow you to send and
receive text messages to/from Enron colleagues. Sametimeis not a replacement
for email or the phone, but rather it should complement both exiting
communication tools. This is a tool that will be of most value to people who
spend a lot of time at their PC, but who want to ask a question of someone,
conduct a simple conversation or send a message in real time, without having
to pick up the phone or compose an email message.
Sametimegives users instant messaging capabilities. The green square tells
you who is online and able to receive a message, while the red dot gives a
simple indication of people who may be away from their desk (see screen
sample below).
I use the system everyday and find it invaluable in communicating with my
team. It also comes into its own when communicating with people in other
offices, especially Houston (you can even use it on the road!). A nice
feature is that you can fire off a message to someone and know it will sit on
their screen until they read it.  Sametime'susefulness falls under the
+Network, effect, i.e. the more people online, the greater the benefit.
Sametime will be available on your desktop in the not too distant future, so
watch out for further details.  Looking forward to sametiming with you soon!

ENRON NIGHT AT THE RACES MAKES AN IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY

Last month the Enron Social Committee hosted an evening at the Greyhound
Races in Wimbledon.  The proceeds of the evening, combined with a 'matching'
donation from Enron, raised o1,600 for The Battersea Dogs' Home.  With the
charity spending an average o530 per dog that comes into the home, the money
was gratefully received by BDH.  Thanks to all who helped make a difference!

ENRON SECURITY

In the last couple of weeks items of property have been stolen from staff
members' desks. All
staff are reminded that it is their responsibility to secure all valuables at
the end of each working day
and that we operate a clear desk policy in Enron House.

During the last 48 hours security officers have removed 8 mobile phones, 6
Palm Pilots and two laptops
for safekeeping. All of these items were left unattended on desks.

40 minutes and an added charge of o8 for a French pedicure.  If you schedule
a manicure and pedicure together you will receive at 10% discount.  Payment
can be made by cheque or with cash.


QUIZ OF THE WEEK

A man asks his friend to guess the ages of his three nieces. The uncle gives
his friend a clue: the product of the nieces' ages is 2450.

Being a smart guy the friend concludes after some math work that he needs
some additional information.
He is told that the sum of the nieces' ages equals his house number.

After a while he once again asks for an additional clue. The uncle tells him
that all the nieces are younger than himself (the friend).

How old is the friend?
And in what house number does he live?

(with thanks to Gunvor Bay from the Oslo office for providing the Quiz of the
Week)


AND THE WINNER OF LAST WEEK'S QUIZ IS. . .

Congratulations to Adam Kodish for being last week's Riddle of the Day
winner.  The answer to the riddle was 'surname'!
