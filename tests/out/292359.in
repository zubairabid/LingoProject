Greg --

No word from C1 yet, which is strange.  I will give Mark Hoffman a call this week if I do not hear from Matt Graves soon.

I talked with Bill Popp of Sungard yesterday.  Bill is trying to gather up the appropriate Sungard folks for a meeting.  The bad news is that Sungard's going-in posture is for a royalities-only approach, much like everyone else has tried initially.  Obviously, this is preliminary, and we will have the opportunity to influence this.  Sungard is much more comfortable with their core business of processing transactions rather than that of selling front-end applications.  This bias makes them cautious in approaching the Offline opportunity.  Clearly, we need to get them in for a detailed demo -- their knowledge of Offline is still very sketchy.

We are dealing with the trading and risk systems group in Sungard.  We also have a corporate-level sponsor in Ron Lang.  I will ask Mark Palmer if he can get us more info on overall corporate structure.  Thanks.
