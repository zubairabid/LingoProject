I've clarified the language in 2(a).
Paul / Dan:
A summary of the alternatives related to the LNG winter cargo follows:
1. If we don't do anything and Cabot does not deliver:
a. We may save $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges, but will have exposure to spot fuel prices at a time when prices are expected to rise.
2. Write a letter to Cabot notifying them that we have an opportunity to secure a winter cargo now and have them confirm their commitment to a winter cargo delivery.
a. Should Cabot commit to a winter cargo we would be in the same position we are today with the exception that they no longer have the ability to cancel the winter cargo on short notice. If we later decline to receive the winter cargo we still pay the $4.7 million in demand charge and surcharge. We would decline to nominate a winter cargo from Cabot only if spot fuel prices are lower than the commodity charge and surcharge.
b. Should Cabot not commit to a delivery we are relieved of the obligation to pay the $4.7 million in demand charges and surcharges and can buy a spot cargo at an additional savings. The total potential benefit to EcoElectrica of the transaction can be close to $5 million at the current LNG prices (this scenario will be better if prices go down)..
Given where the LNG market is today we should proceed to send the letter to Cabot.
