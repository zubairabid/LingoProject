I obtained a copy of a letter sent to Gary Fuller from the Department of
Fish and Game on November 3, 2000. In the letter the Fish and Game agreed
EOTT has 41 Acres of conservation credits based on Arco Western Energy's
sale of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant and premises to Koch Oil
and Gas, and Koch's subsequent sale of the plant and premises to EOTT
ENERGY.
In the letter the following limitations and clarifications were listed:
Because the conservation credits may be used for mitigation of EOTT
impacts, or sold by EOTT to third parties for their own mitigation needs,
EOTT must affirm that it will conform to the Department's  standards for
sale of conservation credits as well as management of the credit lands.
These obligations are already implied by the chain of Koch's and then
EOTT's acquisitions  of the North Coles Levee fractionator plant. EOTT and
Department representatives will need to meet to discuss these details and
determine the most efficient means to implement these conditions.
Key provision of the obligations that attend using the conservation credits
include Department approval of third-party sales;  minimum endowment
requirements for all credit sales; management and monitoring of habitat
conditions; and additional mitigation for disturbance to dedicated habitat.
Habitat continuity and small animal movement between the North Coles
fractionator plant site and the remainder of Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve
must be provided in order to maintain viability of the habitat within
EOTT's holdings.
Although it appears we do have the credits for NCL, I do not know if Gary
ever met with the Fish and Game to discuss the details or means to
implement the conditions for use of the conservation credits. With the
project set to start we may have to purchase the 15.3 acres of credit from
Area.

Approval
(Document link: Kenny Maltby)
Kenny and Scott,
I agree with Ed's note concerning the need to move expeditiously in the
purchase of compensation acreage noted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service
(Service) in there approval letter.  This in indeed "good news" and EOTT
must move ahead to fulfill its obligation as per the MOU and Incidental
Take Permit.  By copy of this email, I am asking Larry Campbell to work
with both of you to assist in the proper fulfillment of EOTT's obligation
as promptly as possible.
It is also my understanding, from what research I have been able to do,
that EOTT does have approximately 14 to 15 acres of credit at the North
Coles Levee Preserve.  You should verify the exact credit number and
furnish the Service with such verification.  That is acreage EOTT will not
have to purchase in satisfying the obligation of the permit.
Keep me posted as you move forward on this issue.  John Shafer
