Murray -
Sorry for the delay.  We spent a lot of time this morning working with the
designer of the Gas solution.  We have a much better understanding of their
business case now, and of course the resultant IT solution.  This should
help us in attacking the Power issue.
Attached are the updated memo I sent yesterday, with a more detailed
description and an illustration of the data flow, and a new document with a
set of questions that we may use to steer our initial information gathering
sessions.  Please take a look at these and let me know if you have any
questions.
Annie and I will be meeting with Chris for more business case understanding
next week.  I look forward to this time, and will work with Randy Wilson to
post status to you by week-end.  Thanks.
