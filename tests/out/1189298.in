Enron/Reuters Working Group:

Attached is a revised version of the Terms & Conditions which incorporates
changes discussed today.  Please note the following:

Section 4.1:  In the interest of time, I took a shot at adding language here
regarding access to Reuters Content by Reuters competitors.  I am open to your
comments and suggestions on this language.

Section 5.1:  I have reviewed the Order Forms, and will agree to your proposal
to take out the language "solely for the purpose of accessing the Reuters
Content".

Section 14.2:  After considerable internal debate, we will take out subsection
(iv), provided that we can achieve some consensus on the remaining legal
issues.

Addendum, Section 1:  We understand that you are taking news in realtime via a
datafeed and have approved your redistribution of such news in real time.  I
also understand that your are taking market data via an API and that such data
is sent to you in delayed form via the API.  Therefore, Section 1 does not
apply
to Enron at this time.

The purpose of Section 1 is to cover a situation in which Enron were to
migrate
from the API to an actual datafeed product or take a market data datafeed in
addition to the API.  We have had clients in the past who desired to upgrade
their Internet site and take market data via a Reuters Datafeed in lieu of or
in
conjunction with the API.  In such event, the client simply completed a new
Order Form and we did not have to renegotiate the Terms & Conditions.  With
that
in mind, we would like to retain Section 1 in the Terms & Conditions.  I have
tried to insert additional wording to make clear it will not impact the deal
currently under negotiation.

Stanford Lin
