As some of you may know, I have been working with Lindon Chiu of the IT department to generate real time, hourly graphs for various California data (load, imports, temperature).  We now have the preliminary graphs, and they can be accessed at:

http://fundamentals.dev.corp.enron.com/main.asp (not the same link as the main fundamentals page)
(click on "Gas", "Testing", and then "Load and Temperature Charts")

These are the premilinary graphs which pull data from the Portland West Power database, so they will include only the data available in the Portland tables .  The finalized versions will actually scrape the various data straight from their original souces (Cal ISO website, Bonneville website), which will make them more reliable.

Please look at the graphs, and tell me what changes you would like, if any.  I will pass them along to Lindon before he starts work on the finalized graphs, which will eventually be included in the "Integrative Reporting System" for the entire floor.

Also, please forward to anyone else you think would be interested in these graphs.

As a reminder, the WSCC outages graphs can still be accessed at the main fundamentals webpage under "Gas", "Testing", "WSCC Outages".

Please e-mail me with any questions or concerns.  Thank you!
