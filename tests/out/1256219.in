ICE Continues to Attract and Consolidate Liquidity
Average daily trading activity up 30% in January
New daily records set for North American power and gas

Atlanta, GA (January 16, 2002) - IntercontinentalExchange (ICE), one of the
world's most liquid and fastest growing commodity marketplaces, announced
today that trading volumes continue to grow at a record pace with average
daily activity system-wide up 30% over a month ago.

ICE also again set new daily trading records with North American power
volume of more than 17 million MWhs (megawatt hours) on January 14th and
North American natural gas volume of more than 630 BCF (billion cubic feet)
traded on January 9th.

"These volumes indicate that the market remains healthy despite the loss of
a major player and that liquidity continues to be attracted to the ICE
platform," said Chuck Vice, COO of IntercontinentalExchange. "The ability
for ICE users to minimize exposure to any one firm by broadly distributing
business across a large and diverse group of counterparties, coupled with
our role as a neutral marketplace, is attracting incredible volume.  We
expect this trend to continue in February as we begin offering clearing
services via the global banking and brokerage community which owns and
operates the London Clearing House."

To date, month over month comparisons by market on ICE are as follows:

Market					MTD Jan.`02 Daily Average 	% Increase over Dec.`01
Daily Average
North American Power(megawatt hours)	12 million				51%
North American Gas(cubic feet)		415 billion				37%
European Gas(therms)				117 million				32%
Oil(equivalent barrels)				9 million 				10%
Precious Metals(equivalent gold oz)		600,000 				100%

ICE emissions and weather derivative markets continue to be active as well
with January volumes to date doubling those in December.

As an open-access, multi-lateral electronic marketplace,
IntercontinentalExchange has built a strong track record for offering
increased liquidity and transparency to OTC market participants.  Over 500
of the world's largest commodity trading firms are now ICE participants.
