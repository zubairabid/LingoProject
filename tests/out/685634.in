Greetings from the Pac Rim Club!

Weve been able to get a discount of $100 on the tour price from Executive
Tours, lowering the price of the Pac Rim tour to $2,085 for double occupancy
and $2,455 for single occupancy.  (This discount is dependent on having a
minimum of 10 participants on the trip.)  The new lower prices apply to new
sign-ups as well as to those currently registered for the trip.  In the
event the tour does not get a minimum of ten participants, anyone who
registers may request and will receive a full refund of their deposit.
Along with these new price cuts, the deadline for registration has been
extended to Friday, November 2nd.  If you are interested in participating in

This year's trip is going to be fantastic!!

Itinerary

Bangkok, Thailand offers incredible temples, outstanding cuisine, fantastic
shopping and the friendliest people youve ever met. Thailand is called the
Land of a Thousand Smiles for good reason.

Siem Reap (Angkor), Cambodia: The magnificent temples of Angkor have only
recently opened to tourism after years of civil war and unrest. Now is a
perfect time to visit these timeless wonders before they are marred by the
rapid growth in tourism.

Ho Chi Minh City (Saigon), Vietnam: This is the most vibrant and dynamic
country in Southeast Asia. Saigon is sophisticated, exciting and endlessly
fascinating, from its glorious French colonial architecture to its modern
club scene and nightlife.

Nha Trang, Vietnam: Endless white sand beaches, warm sunshine, tropical
breezes. Need we say more?

Singapore: We will only have one overnight in Singapore as a result of the
airline schedule. But what a great city to spend a night! Discover Little
India, Arab Street, pubs along Boat Quay or sample Malay cuisine at a hawker
stand.
