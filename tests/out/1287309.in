Susan,

We have asked for engineering support from EEOS to help us research power generation opportunities along our pipelines.  They require some type of work order to charge their time and expenses and we need the same to track development costs for our initiatives.  I was told that a "project definition account" can be set up in SAP that can accumulate these costs and tie them to our group's cost center.  Could you please set up two such accounts?  Here are the particulars so far:

Account 1.
Name:  ETS Distributed Generation Initiative
Amount:  Not to exceed $100,000 in 2001
Access:  Eric Gadd, Kevin Hyatt, John Millar, Susan Wadle, Roger Tietz, Harry Okabayashi, Gus Eghneim

Account 2:
Name:  Bakersfield Powergen
Amount:  Not to exceed $50,000 in 2001
Access:  Eric Gadd, Kevin Hyatt, John Millar, Susan Wadle, Gary Bush, Mike Nanny, Steve Kemper

Let me know if a more formal tasking letter is necessary to set these up.  Thanks for your help.

John
