Tana,
Regarding the proposed deal, the attached file describes the terms agreed
upon with Duke (similar structure than C. Puerto's swap, except that now
Enron sells & Duke buys). Duke's trader with whom I have been talking to is
Amy Statler, located in their BsAs office.
After reading the e-mail below sent by Erik Ludtke, from Duke, in which he
mentions "ISDA agreement, partially executed by ECT.", and later requests the
confirmation letter, I still have my doubts on what Confirmation Letter he's
talking about. I think he's referring to the receipt letter for the ISDA
document they sent and not the Confirm of this particular deal. Prior to this
Confirm, we would need an ECT trader to get on the phone with Duke and
execute the deal.
Let me know what you think and the outcome of your conversation with Roni
Cappadonna.
