To All
I have done a cursory review of the requirements of the agencies contacted, and 2 significant itmes leap out.
#1 New Mexico BLM Permitting - Cultural Resources
David Simmons - Archeologist - Farmington BLM office quoted " Navajo ROW costs usually approximately $1MM/mile". THIS COULD MAKE AN UNECONOMICAL PROJECT FROM DAY 1
#2 Longest permit times are 1 year, which means that with a tentative schedule as follows:
FERC Filing - Sept/01 to March 30/02
FERC Approval - April 1/02 - April 1/03 - 1 year
Construction - April 1/03 - Jan 1/04 - 9 mos
In order to start construction by April 1/03 to achieve an in service in early 2004, application for specific long lead permits will need to be made April 1/02. This will require significant field work and design details prior to April 1/02. I doubt we will be ready to commit to such an undertaking this early in the process.
I suggest after the ENSR fatal flaw analysis is complete, a very comprehensive review of all permits and their relation to the critical path is undertaken.
