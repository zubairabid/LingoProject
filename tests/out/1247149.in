As you are aware, there are  many families that have been affected by the recent layoffs at Enron.  I  along with two other ex-employees (Karen Cutler and Sue Nix) have been working  on a project which will provide assistance to ex-employees of Enron. We wanted  to do something to help our fellow employees and also provide a tool that others  could use to provide assistance to ex-Enron employees. This week, we've been  working with an attorney and a local bank. An account has been set up where  people can make contributions. All the money will be given back to ex-Enron  employees that need assistance with basic necessities, such as money for food,  rent/mortgage payments, and utilities. We've contacted the local media with the  information so that the community can be made aware of what we're doing. Our  ability to provide assistance will be based on the response we receive.  As  you can see, we're using our values from Enron to help others, and would  appreciate your assistance with communicating this information to the current  Enron employees.
Please send this information in a general announcement to the current Enron  employees so they can be aware of a way to help their fellow ex-employees.   If you need to speak with me or have any questions, I can be reached at  281-812-2466.
