The Master Agreement Structural Issues Working Group met as planned on 18th
June.  As you know, the purpose of the meeting was to try to finalise the
terms of the Cross-Agreement Bridge.

A few substantive comments were made in the meeting, so I am distributing a
slightly revised draft (marked up copy and clean copy) together with a
request for final comments by the close of business, London time, on Friday,
6th July.  Please send comments to me at jberry@isda-eur.org
<mailto:jberry@isda-eur.org>  and to Peter Werner at pwerner@isda-eur.org
<mailto:pwerner@isda-eur.org> .

The amendments to the draft reflect the view expressed in the meeting that,
where parties have specified Automatic Early Termination to apply in their
Master Agreement, parties should have the ability to provide that a Bridging
Event will occur immediately upon the deemed designation of an Early
Termination Date pursuant to the Automatic Early Termination provisions.  In
other words, if parties choose this option, and an Early Termination Date is
deemed to occur automatically under the ISDA Master Agreement, there would
be no opportunity to "disapply" the bridging provisions.  The bridging
provisions would also apply automatically.

It is likely that the Strategic Documentation Review Task Force will meet
soon to discuss the work products of the different groups of the Strategic
Documentation Review that have been looking at ISDA's Master Agreement.  At
that point, the efforts of this group will come under further scrutiny, so
please do take this opportunity to review the attached final draft!
