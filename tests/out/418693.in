While I was on vacation, trade nx9526 was entered into with this customer.  I
attempted to pull the confirmation in TAG but their was none.  Did we ever
confirm this trade?  If not, I would like to go ahead and confirm it using
the credit language prepared and adopted for trade nx3782.  Attached is the
worksheet that was provided for nx3782.

thanks
