Here are some thoughts on what our message may be.
Unclear how this is going to increase supply, decrease demand, and increase
customer choice.  Still doesn't make sense to us to have the state buy a
crumbling transmission network instead of school lunches.
We don't have enough details.  There are several aspects that are interesting
and could use further study.  Governor Davis needs to make the details public
as soon as possible so people can understand the full implications.  For
instance, what happens to DWR contracts?  Will they be assigned to SCE?  Will
customers have the right to choose going forward?
The recent events highlight the critical need to make sure that customers can
make their own energy decisions going forward.  We know that Government
doesn't know how to get this right.  The right answer is giving customers
more choices, not fewer.
Can't endorse it until we know if our bills are going to be paid in full.  If
the bills aren't paid in full, highly likely that we'll see involuntary
bankruptcy.
Too bad that this deal wasn't done earlier.  It could have saved alot of
money and pain.
Why do you need to include the transmission purchase in this deal?  May never
happen.  Make it easy - just deal with the under collection through
securitization and throught the EIX refund to SCE and get on with it.
