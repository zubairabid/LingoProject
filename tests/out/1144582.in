As requested, I am providing the list of counterparties with whom we are working on netting arrangements and the status.

Coastal States Trading-	Under progress to implement payment and default netting.  Enron revisions 			requested and awaiting Coastal feedback.  Expected to be non-controversial.  I 			have spoken with Brent Hendry and he is comfortable with proceeding 				on this basis and will also proceed with Master Netting Agreement.
ConAgra-	            Expected  to execute by end of the week. (Master Crude Oil P&S with CSA)
Conoco- 		Executed by both parties (only payment netting)
Crown Central-		Executed by Enron. Will be sent to Crown for completion of execution. (only 			payment netting requested in their draft)
Morgan Stanley- 	Executed by both parties. (only close-out netting)
Sunoco-		Executed by Enron. Will be sent to Sunoco for completion of execution. (only 			payment netting requested in their draft)
Valero-			Executed by Enron. Will be sent to Valero. (only payment netting requested in 			their draft)
Williams-		Under progress to implement payment netting for crude trading.  I have discussed 			this with Jeff Hodge and he is comfortable with proceeding on this basis, but will 			proceed with Master Netting Agreement.

Please let me know if you have any comments or questions.
