Hello Mark

We are migrating the revamped Clickpaper application to production and we would like to have some guidence of how to handle our obligations, if any, to Ariba the vendor who supplied the original software engine for Clickpaper.  As we are replacing all of the Ariba application with our the EOL application we no long rely on Ariba for the application.

Below are some questions we have regarding how we should proceed with notifying Ariba:

1)	We will stop displaying their logo and text in our alliances section on the site.  Do we need to notify them?
2) 	What communication should we send to Ariba regarding our descision to terminate service?
3) 	How much do we owe them based on Early Termination.

Plus any other action you think necessary.  Attached is our contract with Ariba.  Please call me if you have any questions at 5-2824.

Regards,

Robbie Pateder
