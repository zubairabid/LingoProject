I would like to add some questions to the ones Dave has raised below.
1.  Would it make a difference if we were transacting Metals in a separate
web site from EOL?   I would see this as EnronMetals (the new name for MG)
running there own site issuing their own products.  I think we would need
this because we would be unable have an EnronOnline entity issuing LME
contracts with a sleeving arrangement to EnronMetals/MG.  My understanding is
that only a registered entity can issue LME Contracts.
2.  If we had to go to the separate site to address this issue, how would we
handle the links to EOL?  I assume people on EnronMetals could not trade
other products (ngas) on EnronMetals site.  Could we have a click through?
Would they have to sign in again?
