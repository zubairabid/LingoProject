I received the margin letter this morning via Fax.  However, it is backdated to Nov 19th for my phone call with Richard Ott at NIMO.  We have 5 days to deliver (some flexibility to view it as 5 business days).  The margin call is for $4,283,512.  It is to cover NIMO for settlement and imbalance risk for EES participation in their "Supplier Select" program.
