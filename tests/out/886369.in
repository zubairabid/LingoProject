Hey y'all,

as most of you would probably know by now, I have chosen to leave Enron to
pursue other opportunities.  It's been a good time (4+ years) with great
experiences both in North/South America and in Europe.

I'd like to use this e-mail to thank everybody for their good work and
friendship.  In particular (in order of appearance): Dung Tran, Jon Doyle,
Dave Ramm, Natalie Halich, Roberto Silveira and Rick Waddell have been great
sources of learning and leadership.

'Other opportunities' means exactly that - not quite sure what the next
adventure will be, but it won't be boring!  I encourage you to reply with
your personal e-mail etc., so that we can keep in touch.

All the best,
Christian
