Wanted to give you brief update (see below from Chris Calger) on the current value of renewables/strategy within wholesale and retail businesses.  Both a West Desk and East Desk have been established.  I am continuing to work closely with Elliot and Richard.  On the retail side, we're putting together product descriptions for the originators to put before current and new customers.  On the wholesale side, we're working with generators to list their RECs on EOL.
