We have had recurring problems with Morgan's west power group(scheduling,
real time, anyone) being absolutely unreachable after 2 pm our time, for any
reason.

Geir had a number of their schedules have difficulty this weekend, and called
me in desperation for a way to reach them. I have spoken to Morgan's staff
numerous times about their unavailability, and those conversations seem to
have no impact.

Today it presents a problem because  one of their tags is denied, and there
is nobody there to fix them. They did not correct their tag, and I had to
intervene and create one on their behalf and deal with the control area at 5
pm.

Please keep these diffuculties in mind, and if you have any influence with
their trading staff, encourage them to beef up their staffing, especially on
real time.
