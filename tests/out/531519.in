KERN RIVER AMENDS 2002 EXPANSION; DISPUTE FLAIRS OVER DISPOSITION OF CAPACITY
AT WHEELER RIDGE
Kern River Gas Transmission (CP01-31) recently amended its 11/15/00
application for authority to construct and operate facilities (2002 Expansion
Project) to serve new and existing powerplants in California as of 5/1/02.
Because the 2002 Expansion now incorporates most of the facilities to be
installed for the short-term California Action Project (CP01-106), Kern River
needs only an additional 10,500 dth/d from Wyoming to California. The 10,500
dth/d plus 114,000 dth/d expiring on 5/1/02 for California Action shippers
will create 124,500 dth/d needed by all 2002 Expansion shippers. However, the
revised design includes the continuation of 21,000 dth/d of capacity - at the
Wheeler Ridge delivery point where Kern River interconnects with Southern
California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) - available to California Action shippers
through 5/1/03, at which time Kern River will incorporate the 21,000 dth/d
into its 2003 Expansion Project. In its April order certificating the
expedited California Action Project, FERC also directed Kern River to seek
explicit authority to reserve excess capacity for planned future expansions.
Kern River (RP01-411) complied with a tariff filing which triggered a protest
from the Firm Customers.  The Firm Customers 1 claim that Wheeler Ridge is
significantly constrained, and Kern River should not be able to reserve
capacity especially at that point until all existing firm shippers with
primary delivery point rights are reliably served.  In the most recent
development, on June 4, Kern River answered that &it is not responsible8 for
problems downstream of Wheeler Ridge.

California Action Project (CP01-106). FERC granted Kern River a certificate
on April 6 to provide up to 135,000 Mcf/d of limited-term, incremental
capacity from Wyoming to California as of July 1 to address the urgent need
for additional energy. In the order, the Commission recognized that upgrading
the meter station at Wheeler Ridge would create &some excess capacity8 and
that Kern River planned to reserve that capacity for its 2003 Expansion.
While the reservation of capacity was not precluded under its existing
tariff, Kern River told FERC that it would file for explicit authority to
reserve capacity under the current circumstances.  Noting that such capacity
would be available for interruptible and secondary firm deliveries between
the in-service dates of the California Action and the 2003 Expansion, the
Commission directedKern River to file a tariff provision within 30 days. In a
request for rehearing filed May 7, the Firm Customers challenged FERC,s
assumption that there will be &some excess capacity8 at Wheeler Ridge. They
cited evidence indicating that Wheeler Ridge is already constrained,
resulting in &significant8 scheduling cuts (e.g., firm nominations cut 50% in
May). They insisted that expansion shippers should not have primary point
access at Wheeler Ridge. In the alternative, expansion shippers should not
enjoy the same level of firm service as existing shippers. This line of
argument was challenged by Kern River and expansion shipper Mirant Americas
Energy Marketing LLC, who urged FERC to deny rehearing.

Capacity Reservation Proposal (RP01-411). On May 7, Kern River filed a
revised tariff sheet, the Firm Customers filed a protest, and Kern River
answered. While they support expansion of Kern River into California, the
Firm Customers fear that the proposed tariff language &is not sufficiently
conditioned toprevent Kern River from reserving (i.e., withholding) or
reselling capacity on an interim basis where there is no excess capacity to
reserve or resell.8 They are particularly concerned that Kern River may be
able to withhold capacity, and/or sell incremental capacity on an interim
basis, at Wheeler Ridge. The proposal &would permit Kern River to reserve
what it does not have (i.e., +excess capacity,) and to recapture what it has
already sold (i.e., primary firm capacity held by existing Firm Customers)
for sale to others.8 This violates the Commission's regulations and is
&contrary to every notion of due process, fairness, and the sanctity of
contracts,8 they said. As in their request for rehearing of the California
Action order, the Customers cited evidence of &significant8 scheduling cuts
at Wheeler Ridge. &Kern River should not be allowed to reserve (or sell)
capacity at the Wheeler Ridge point until there is excess primary delivery
point capacity at that point and sufficient downstream take-away capacity
such that existing firm shippers, scheduling nominations for primary points
are not cut,8 they said. Accordingly, they urged the Commission to reject the
tariff filing to the extent that it allows reservation or interim sale of
capacity at Wheeler Ridge; and to clarify that Kern River is not allowed to
withhold excess capacity at any point on its system &when there are shippers
that are willing to pay maximum tariff rates for such capacity under
long-term contracts.8  The Firm Customers failed to seek rehearing expressly
on FERC,s directive about Wheeler Ridge, shot back Kern River. The attempt to
get FERC &to disallow in this docket what the Commission recognized and
allowed in [CP01-106] is inappropriate,8 the company said.  In any case, the
&essence8 of their position was already set forth in the rehearing request.
As before, the Firm Customers &disregard the fact that Kern River is not
responsible for the market problems downstream of its Wheeler Ridge delivery
point,8 but only for &reliably meeting its commitment to provide firm
transportation deliveries8 to that point. It has reliably delivered all
quantities scheduled by SoCalGas for take-away and has the capacity to
deliver volumes up to the level of its firm contract obligations.  Moreover,
a prohibition on reservation of capacity at Wheeler Ridge would change the
facility design of the 2003 Expansion which, in turn, could delay a new
certificate filing beyond August 1 and the in-service date of the 2003
Expansion beyond 5/1/03. It could also could cause overbuilding of expansion
capacity and increase costs for both new and existing shippers.

Amended 2002 Expansion (CP01-31). In the original application filed 11/15/00,
Kern River proposed to provide up to 124,500 dth/d of new, firm, long-term
contract demand as of 5/1/02. The amendment, filed May 11, proposes to
install an additional unit at Kern River,s Muddy Creek Compressor Station in
Lincoln County, Wyoming; a new unit at its Daggett Compressor Station in San
Bernardino County, California; and an upgrade of its Opal Meter Station in
Lincoln County, Wyoming. These facilities will cost approximately $31.4
million. A pro rata share (124.5 dth/d out of 145.5 dth/d) of California
Action costs will be allocated to the 2002 Expansion. Kern River renewed its
request for a predetermination of rolled-in rate treatment for the 2002
Expansion since the billing determinants (124,500 dth/d) will reduce existing
rates by 6%-7%, offset in part by higher compressor fuel costs and electric
compressor costs.  To ensure recovery of actual costs from shippers flowing
gas through Daggett (excluding California Action shippers subject to a
separate, incremental fuel in-kind reimbursement obligation), Kern River
still sought FERC approval of a pro forma tariff provision establishing an
electric compressor fuel surcharge.  However, the initial surcharge now
proposed is $0.0099 per dth of gas flow through the station, based on updated
gas volumes and electricity costs. Kern River asked the Commission to act by
August so construction can begin at Muddy Creek by September 1, before the
onset of winter in Wyoming.
