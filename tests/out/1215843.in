FERC has noticed this EPSA/EPMI, etal. filing for comments due 4/27/01.  EPSA
will send out a list of suggested comments and feels that it would be better
for companies to each file their own comments.  We (working with Charles)
will handle the comments for Enron.  I don't anticipate that an RCR will be
needed.  Thanks.


EPSA, Enron, etal 12/15/00 request for
technical conference on seams issues
