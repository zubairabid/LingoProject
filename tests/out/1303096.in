We are planning to have the fantasy draft on Wednesday at 7:30 (or whenever Kris yells out "Let's Do This") at my apartment (Archstone Memorial Heights #2017).  The website is established and you can check it out and change your information (link at bottom).  Use this link to establish a username and id, then you can logon on from nfl.com and choosing fantasy.  Members have expressed an interest in learning their draft position before draft day, so we are planning on drawing for draft placement at 8:00 tonite at my apt. or at 10:00 tonite at the Marquee (depending on your response).  You do not need to be present, but are invited to either attend or participate via phone, internet.  Draft night will be BYOB, and when ya'll see the caliber team that I will be fielding, you will want to drink heavily.  The $50 league fee is due by the start of Week 3, penalizable with a loss untill it is paid.  To entice early payment, a 10% discount will be offered to anyone who pays on draft night.  Email or call me with any questions/concerns/advice about the league.
