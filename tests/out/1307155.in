as i previously reported, all of the other defendants settled with the plaintiff. significantly, their settlement included the dismissal of the most onerous (contract) counts (1 thru 4) against the enron defendants as well.   today we received a host of such notices from the court reflecting these developments.

in addition, the court ordered a settlement conference for December 12 at 1:30, and specifically ordered that all clients be present.  we accordingly need at this juncture to discuss your posture as to settlement.  we also need to know whether you think you should attend this conference, and if so, whether the date works for you.  (if not, i can attempt to have it rescheduled).  if you don't think you need to be there, i can try to have you hooked in by phone.  so let us know your thoughts.  even if your position is still not to offer anything, this conference should provide a terrific opportunity to set the stage for the judge about our confidence in the merits of our pending motions.

copies of the notices are on their way to all of you. please get back to me at your earliest convenience with your thoughts on settlement and the conference.
