Jeff Dasovich and I, along with several IEP members, met with Gov Davis'
staff today, including his Chief of Staff, his Staff Director and two policy
advisors on energy issues.  They made the following points:
The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity
issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).
The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but
they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls,
a big part of the problem is a "dysfunctional market" -- a thinly veiled
reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.
The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,
customers and generators) must "behave responsibly".
Everyone must "share the pain".
The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature
returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislative
proposals in the next couple of weeks.
While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the
attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was
fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.
The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of
new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments
about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmission
siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The
staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution but
remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money and
remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the state
(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with is
a "share the pain" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of the
deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the form
of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either
agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.
The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis
administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the
problem.
I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as
always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should
prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)
that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forward
(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps
them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already
articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale
around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the
political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.  Jeff will follow
up with one of the staff members in particular (Kari Dohn) and I would
suggest that Jeff and Sandi work together on putting the necessary political
rhetoric around the solutions we have proposed.
