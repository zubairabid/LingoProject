California's near-bankrupt utilities are demanding that higher electric rates
be a part of any deal to sell the state their power lines, The Chronicle has
learned.
A rate increase -- perhaps of more than 50 percent, according to earlier
industry estimates -- would certainly draw a firestorm of protest from
consumer groups and force Gov. Gray Davis to backtrack from earlier pledges
that rates would remain unchanged.
Nevertheless, sources close to negotiations on the deal said Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison are attempting to make higher
rates a condition for agreeing to a bailout scheme in which they would sell
the state their transmission systems and some land.
The sources said the talks hit a new snag this week when state officials
realized that fine print sought by the companies could require the Public
Utilities Commission to pass along all of the utilities' costs to ratepayers.
The sources said this would end a rate freeze that shields consumers from
runaway wholesale electricity prices.
The inclusion of potential rate increases in the talks reflects the growing
complexity of a deal originally intended by Davis to stabilize the finances
of PG&E and Edison so banks would resume loans to the cash-strapped
utilities.
The negotiations subsequently have expanded to involve a state purchase of
the utilities' transmission networks and acquisition of utility-owned land,
including spectacular coastal property near PG&E's Diablo Canyon nuclear
power plant.
Now they also have embraced further deregulation of California's
dysfunctional electricity market.
"Clearly, one of the terms being discussed is the regulatory environment,"
said Joseph Fichera, head of Saber Partners, a New York investment bank that
is advising Davis in the talks.
"The past situation has not worked well," he added. "The utilities want some
certainty about their future."
TENTATIVE DEAL WITH EDISON
To date, the governor has announced a tentative agreement with Edison for the
state to buy the utility's power lines for almost $3 billion. Discussions
with PG&E for a similar accord have dragged on for weeks.
An Edison official, asking that his name be withheld, acknowledged yesterday
that an end to the rate freeze is an expected result of the power- line sale.
"Once the details of the pact are complete, dominoes will fall," the official
said. "One of the dominoes is the rate freeze."
A PG&E spokesman declined to comment.
In fact, both Edison and PG&E have been aggressively seeking an end to the
rate freeze for months.
The two utilities have a lawsuit pending in federal court demanding that the
PUC immediately raise rates so the utilities can recover almost $13 billion
in debt accrued as a result of the freeze.
"They have been trying a lot of things to get the rate freeze ended in
various forms," said Carl Wood, who sits on the PUC. "Adding it to the
present talks is consistent with past behavior."
Wall Street has taken note that the negotiations no longer appear to be
making progress.
Paul Patterson, an energy industry analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston,
told clients on Monday that the discussions "may have lost some momentum in
recent days." He did not give a reason.
For his part, the governor sounded unusually cautious about the course of the
talks when asked late last week if a breakthrough was imminent.
SECRET STICKING POINTS
"We are going to take the transmission systems and the land that's deeded,
and we will work out an agreement," Davis said at an appearance in San Jose.
"But there are a number of sticking points in the talks with PG&E that I'm
not going to reveal."
One of those sticking points apparently is an insistence that the sale of
utility assets include a long-sought lifting of the rate freeze.
Sources said lawyers from both PG&E and Edison had inserted the related terms
into draft accords affecting each utility, and that the full impact of the
additions was not realized by state officials until this week.
One source said the language was just convoluted enough to slip beneath the
radar screen of state negotiators. But the upshot, once the words had been
parsed, was that the PUC effectively would lose control over power rates.
CREDITWORTHINESS ON THE TABLE
In Edison's case, the terms of the tentative deal include the governor asking
the PUC "to support the creditworthiness" of the utility.
"This would ensure that future investments in both utility distribution and
utility generation plants are provided fair returns of and on capital,
consistent with current authorized returns and capital structure provisions,"
it says.
Sources said the provision could be interpreted as a guarantee from the state
that Edison would be permitted to recoup all outstanding costs from
ratepayers.
"There may be some assumptions about this language that the rate freeze ends
if it is adopted," the Edison official said, adding that he saw no reason to
disagree with such assumptions.
But Fichera, Davis' adviser in the talks, insisted that nothing is set in
stone, and that the negotiations are proceeding without a hitch.
"This is a very complex transaction," he said. "God and the devil are in the
details."
