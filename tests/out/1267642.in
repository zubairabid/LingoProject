GOD IS UP TO SOMETHING -- (T.D. Jakes)
"When you are DOWN to nothing ... God is UP to
something"
Father, in the Name of Jesus, bless the one
reading this in a special
way. Open supernatural doors in their life today.
Save and set free!
Give them a double portion of your Spirit as we
take back everything
that the devil has stolen: Emotional Health,
Physical Health Finances,
Relationships, Children, Jobs, Homes,Marriages.
I cancel every plot, plan and scheme the enemy
has devised against
them, in
the MATCHLESS NAME OF JESUS.
And I declare:
NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST THEM WILL PROSPER.
I speak LIFE into every dead situation. And, I
thank you that nothing
is over until YOU say it's over! I speak
prophetically into their
lives and to their situations:
Their household is blessed;
Their health is blessed;
Their marriage is blessed;
Their finances are blessed;
Their jobs are blessed;
Their children are blessed;
Their grandchildren are blessed;
Their parents are blessed;
Their siblings are blessed;
Their ministries are blessed; and,
Their decisions are blessed.
Husbands are on the way;
Wives are on the way;
Mortgages are paid and canceled;
Their hearts desires are on the way;
according to YOUR perfect will and Plan for their
lives.
IN THE NAME OF JESUS! AMEN!
Pray this prayer back to the one who prayed it
for you, then
Send to EVERYBODY YOU KNOW. Within hours
countless people will have
prayed for you, and you will have caused a
multitude of people to pray
to God for other people.
"In our daily lives, we must see that it is not
happiness that
makes us grateful, but the gratefulness that
makes us happy."
