Barbara--

Very helpful and encouraging report.  Sounds like the Gov. and the Consumers Counsel are with us on RTOs.  Would they be willing to write their own letters, I assume separately, to the Ohio congressional delegation? There are several Ohio members on the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  Is the Consumers Counsel a Democrat (that would help since there are three Ohio Democrats on the committee -- Brown, Strickland and Sawyer?).  Even if he is a Republican, support from within the state would help a great deal.  Thanks.

John
