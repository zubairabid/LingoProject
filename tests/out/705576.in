As an update to many of you, I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA
Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action "may affect" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat "oddly."  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a "BA-like" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under "normal" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of "may affect" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our "BA-like"
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to "get inside their heads" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott
