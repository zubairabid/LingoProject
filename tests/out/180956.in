SDGE's Advice Letter filing confirms that the ABX143 rate freeze of 6.5 cents
does not apply to direct access.
In hearings on SDGE's potential rate increase for large customers:
SDGE has proposed to allocate all retained generation to small customers
(below 100 kw).  Large customers would be served  by DWR (or be direct
access).  It's apparent several parties have major problems with this.
It is interesting that SDGE has calculated the expected rate increase under
their plan as 2.86 cents.  If large customers are allocated a piece of
retained generation, the increase goes up to 2.99 cents.  In the latter case,
large customers retain a CTC (related to QF contracts and other long term
stranded costs) that they would lose in the former case.
Our involvement is to get an order 1) excluding DA from any rate increase
(the proposed 2.86 cents) 2) excluding DA from any surcharge related to
undercollection from the rate freeze (an amount that is not known at this
point) 3) prorating the surcharge related to undercollection if the customer
switches from DA to bundled service during the rate freeze period 4) ensuring
there is a return to market pricing once the rate freeze is over.
PUC decisions on these issues are expected June 28.  There is no discussion
of restricting movement between bundled service and DA.  On our issues noted
above,  #1, 2, 4 have high probability of success; # 3 is 50/50.
