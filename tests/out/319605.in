We have been getting questions about the ability of potential customers to
sell power onto the grid to EPMI.  Below is a brief outline of the FERC
licenses required.  Customers other than those listed below (including non-QF
industrial on site generators) need a power marketer license from FERC.  In
most cases, such customers do not need to file for EWG status (unless their
primary business is as a utility, like Enron).
In addition, both EPMI and EES filed at FERC for authorization to perform
certain power marketer license functions on behalf of industrial on-site
generation customers.  We expect the authorization within a month.  I'll let
you know when we receive it and what we can do for customers.
