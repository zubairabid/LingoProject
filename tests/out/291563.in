Roberto,
Below are some observations:
For the year 2000 (ignoring October), EcoElectrica sold power to PREPA for:
Capacity:	$0.037/kwh
Energy:		$0.026/kwh
Total:		$0.063/kwh
In 2001 Jan-April:
Capacity:	$0.049/kwh	increase of $0.012/kwh (+32.4%)
Energy:		$0.037/kwh	increase of $0.011/kwh (+42.3%)
Total:		$0.086/kwh
The increase in energy payment mirrors the increase in fuel cost for 2001 versus 2000. Cabot contract LNG Commodity Charge increased 50% from $2.32/MMBtu to $3.48/MMBtu in 2001.
However, the per unit increase in Capacity Payment is almost entirely due to PREPA dispatching Eco at a lower % of availability in 2001. Additionally, PREPA has been offered kwh's above a 76% dispatch for $5.80/MMBtu or $0.0435/kwh but has not purchased them. If PREPA were to dispatch Eco at 88%, I estimate that their total purchase cost of all kwh's purchased would be $0.074/kwh in 2001.
Also, it is not an Apples-to-Apples comparison when PREPA compares their cost of generation using fuel cost only to our cost of generation that includes return of investment capital as well as fuel cost.
Let me know if you want to discuss further.
