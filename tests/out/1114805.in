Hi Casey

We have latest curve points in the database for all Midwest regions. Tomorrow onwards, Traders can start marking their curves in Curve Manager System.

Note : For next two days Traders have to mark their curves in both the systems (Excel /Curve Manager).

If you have any questions, please call me at X57926.
