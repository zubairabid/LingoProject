Friends,

Here is this year's copy of the Bowl Bonanza. PLEASE DO NOT DISTRIBUTE THIS
ELECTRONICALLY TO ANYONE ELSE! If you get anyone in on this pool, YOU are
responsible for their money.

You can email me back YOUR picks, or make copies and FAX them to me at (713)
729-4427, or drop them by my office.  (You're going to need to call me at
(713) 721-3378 before you FAX them so I can get off line and receive your
fax. Evenings are best and it's never too late at night. (We rarely get to
bed before midnight). I need all money and picks back by MONDAY, DECEMBER
17TH!

Mail to:

Bill Rubinsky
5223 Dumfries
Houston, Texas 77096

If for some reason you can't open this, please reply back and I'll drop the
pick sheet in a mailnote or fax them to you.
