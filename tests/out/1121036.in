ACLI has received confirmation from the House leadership that both the
Senate and the House will be be closed and the offices will be tested for
anthrax.  Hastert and his aides said traces of anthrax have been found in
the Dirksen Senate Office Building's ventilation
system, as well as in the Dirksen Senate Office Building mail room where the
Daschle letter was processed. Senators met this morning with their sergeant
at arms and Senate physician about what to do, and a news conference has
been scheduled for noon.

ACLI will provide more details as they become available.
