The market received the announcement of Larry's retirement and Bill's
succession very calmly.   I talked to each of our analysts and elaborated a
bit on the news and answered their questions:
- Why is Larry leaving?  Was there any "hidden" reason?
-  What is Bill's background?
- Does this signal any change in strategy or direction from Enron?
- Do we anticipate any other change in the business as a result of this
management change?
Several said that "since this seems to not be a big change (in direction or
strategy), I'm not going to write anything on it".
The unit price did not reflect much change.   The units opened Monday (the
day of the news) at $29, blipped up some 3/16  just after the press release,
and then settled back to the opening price.   Tuesday opened strong, trended
up $.50 in heavy volume and then again settled to $29.   Wednesday's price
closed up 1/16, at $29.0625.
Daily volumes were:  Monday 27,400 units
Tuesday 50,200 units
Wednesday 20,800 units
We were hoping to communicate that this would be a fairly seamless transition
and continue NBP's history of solid, fairly conservative management, and it
appears that the market interpretted it exactly that way.
