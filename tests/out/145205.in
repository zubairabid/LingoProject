Gerald,
The first attachment is my changes to your letter, which are in bold.  We
also need to know what the NWPL interconnect meter number is, so that our
people can schedule the gas on NWPL from that meter to wherever/whatever they
want to do with the gas.  We/I also need to send Wildhorse something to
inform them of the  contact list - names and phone numbers, and let them know
where to send the transport invoice to.  Should this be in the same letter,
or a different one.... per my conversations with Becky at Wildhorse, they
need this information set up in their system before we nom.  I'll be here
this afternoon.  Please call.
