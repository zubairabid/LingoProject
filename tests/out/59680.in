A major bill for direct access at this time is SBXX 27.  This draft bill has language (Section 3 - part e) that would allow the CA DWR to get a fee from direct access customers who return to utility service to avoid imposing costs on other customers or the state. ESPs would have to pay the fee if they send their customers back to bundled utility service. The fee would be "equivalent to any unvoidable costs imposed on the department's portfolio attributable to the load" of the returning customer.  ESPs would be required to post a bond or demonstrate insurance coverage before they can serve customers. So far, this latter requirement only applies to ESPs who serve small customers, but I could envision this expanding to all ESPs.
