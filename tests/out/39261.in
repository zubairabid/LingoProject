Hey kids, Why don't we pool our resources and get " El Jefe " something nice?  Not like last year... I won't mention names (Donna).... when some individuals within the team didn't want to include the rest of us in their "reindeer games" for bosses day. Any suggestions? Round of golf, gift certificate??? I nominate Suzanne to collect the money. Any objections?
THANKS
