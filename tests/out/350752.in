Shelley--You could show Stan this list that is included in our talking points
for this week's FERC staff meeting:

Enron is very happy about Scott's investigation:  Scott Miller (who reports
to Dan Larcamp) was in charge of the recently issued helpful FERC Staff
Investigations in the Midwest and Southeast, which concluded generally that
vertically integrated utilities (even in RTOs) will continue to have
incentives to benefit their own generation and to keep competitors from using
the grid on a level playing field.  Therefore, Staff suggests that the
Commission consider eliminating the native load exemption and have all
transactions under the same tariff.

For the power markets to flourish with tighter spreads and more liquidity,
need Fully Functioning Independent RTO with:
1.  Real Time Balancing Market with Hourly Clearing Prices (ISO/RTO has
annual auction for bilateral contracts to serve ancillary services)
2.  Single Control Areas:  all market players have same scheduling rights
into real time (can float entire position against the balancing market )
&effectively8  parking and lending)
3.  Single Transmission Tariff:  load pays all transmission costs
4.  No native load or network service
5.  Zonal Market for Energy/Balancing:  Zones are established at electrically
significant constraints ) allows for creation of hubs
6.  Market based congestion management:  independently administered by a
separate ISO market function
7.  Day Ahead Market Function:  ISO load forecast creates demand curve;
generation offers create supply curve (hourly)
8.  Open Information to all Market Participants (outages, supply curve,
demand curve, interchange, etc.)
