Kyle and Greg this issue is still unresolved as well as a 6,000 variance on
contract 5098-695.   I have provided Stacey with the daily allocation from
PG&E Texas.   On Friday she told me she did have an answer yet, and she could
not give me a time frame of when she would be able to get to it.   She said
we have to understand their staff is short, and if anyone has any questions
to call her or Daren direct.  At this time I still do not have an answer, but
will let you know as soon as I do.
