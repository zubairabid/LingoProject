Mark, I wanted to get back to you on your questions and also give a little
more detail of the analysis.  As you know, we have issues in Canada about
taking cash collateral, which issues have been clearly identified and
communicated by Peter previously (see his e-mails of March 20, 2001).
However, as opposed to cash, it appears clear under our personal property
registration legislation that a certified cheque and a bank draft would fall
under the definition of "instruments".  Under such legislation, as Peter has
indicated below, a security interest in "instruments" can be perfected by
possession, thus eliminating the need to register the security interest at
the personal property registry, which requirement to register creates the
perfection and priority concerns we have with holding cash collateral.
Therefore, at first blush, it seems that a counterparty providing a certified
cheque or bank draft to us (in lieu of cash collateral or a letter of
credit), which certified cheque or bank draft would be held by us in the same
manner as we hold L/Cs, might solve our cash collateral concerns and make
another credit instrument available to us for use in Canada.
There are a few concerns, which I think are raised by your questions.  The
first is that, if we take the instrument and immediately convert it to cash
and place the cash in an account, we run into the exact same issues as we
have with taking cash collateral in the first place.  The personal property
security legislation specifically indicates that proceeds realized from
dealing with the original collateral need to be perfected in the same manner
as original collateral of the same kind (ie. where the proceeds from the bank
draft are cash, we need to then perfect our security interest in the cash as
if the original collateral was cash, meaning we have the exact same issues as
we currently have with perfecting a security interest in cash collateral).
Therefore, we would need to deal with the instrument (bank draft or certified
cheque) in the same manner as we deal with L/Cs.  That is, we would cash the
instrument in payment of outstanding accounts at the time that we become
entitled under the contract to apply our collateral against amounts owing to
us from the counterparty.  We would have to actually hold the certified
cheque or bank draft until such entitlement arose.
The requirement to hold the bank draft or certified cheque for a potentially
extended period of time raises another concern about how long such an
instrument can remain outstanding before it becomes "stale dated" and thus
undrawable.  In other words, it may well be that a bank will only allow such
instruments to be drawable if they are presented for payment within a
reasonable time of their issuance.  This is one point that would require
further research if we are going to consider utlizing such instruments as
collateral, since the answer could obviously make the use of such instruments
a solution for only very short term transactions, if at all.
The final point I would make is also raised by your second question below.
My understanding is that the law in Canada has been somewhat grey in the past
with respect to whether a person who issues a certified cheque (or the bank
on which the certified cheque is drawn) can stop payment on such a cheque
after it has been issued.  I believe that there may have been some recent
Ontario decisions indicating that a cheque, once certified, must be honoured
upon presentment and if the bank upon which the certified cheque is drawn
refuses to pay, it will be liable for the amount.  However, we would need to
look into this point further, as any risk that a certified cheque can be
withdrawn by the payor at any time after it has been issued obviously
eliminates the benefit of the collateral.  I do not believe that the same
concern exists for a bank draft, as I believe it represents a fully funded
obligation of the bank to pay, which is irrevocable.
If we wish to consider using such instruments as an alternate form of
collateral, I would suggest that we have such use vetted by outside counsel
and obtain an opinion as to the viability and risks associated with such
use.  Since Stikeman Elliott provided our opinion with respect to cash
collateral, I would suggest that we use them to provide the advice on these
points as well.  Please let me know if you would like me to instruct outside
counsel to proceed.
