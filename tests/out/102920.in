I can join you at 4:00.  Where will you meet?  I would like to ask Stacey White and Jeff Gossett to join us as well - they are the ones with very definite views on the best way to physically locate the risk teams.  Since they are responsible for their respective risk groups, I want them to make the decisions on physical locations that best help them deliver results.  Thanks.  --Sally
