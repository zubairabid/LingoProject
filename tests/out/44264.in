As a reminder to all market participants, a REP does not have to wait until
the recission period expires before it sends the switch request in to ERCOT.
In many scenarios, a customer may wish for a REP to expedite handling of
their request and the REP is willing to balance the risk of  customer
cancellation against a customer's desire to receive service in a hurry.
Although this is not the same "customer protection" period identified below,
it may help expedite some service requests.  Further the PUC would like to
remind market participants of the their obligations as highlighted in the
rule below.  The commission is receiving too many calls from customers who
have not been provided accurate information from their REP and/or from REPs
who merely blame another party for the delays.

Specifically, Substantive rule 25.474(i) states the following:

(i) Submission of customer's selection to the registration agent. A
REP may submit a customer's selection of the REP to the registration agent
prior to the expiration of the cancellation period prescribed by subsection
(h) of this section. Additionally, the REP shall submit the switch request
to the registration agent at the proper time so that the switch will be
processed on the date agreed to by the customer and as allowed by the tariff
of the transmission and distribution utility, municipally owned utility, or
electric cooperative. The customer shall be informed of the scheduled date
that the customer will begin receiving electric service from the REP, and of
any delays in meeting that date. Additionally, the REP must advise the
registration agent of any "special needs" customers and renew such
notification to the registration agent annually.
