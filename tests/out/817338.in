Hello All-

Attached above are the cover letter and proposed tariff sheets filed by Texas Eastern yesterday for a June 1 effective date.  The rate changes reflect under recoveries in their ASA account which tracks their cash-out mechanism and increased cost of system fuel.  The underrecovery in the ASA account has increased from $22,000 to over $22,000,000 over the period September 1--March 31.  Texas Eastern claims that this is largely a result of the gaming of their currently monthly cash-out (which will likely be changed to weekly in their 637 proceeding).  As a result, Texas Eastern is seeking a waiver of the annual filing period in order to begin collecting the underrecovery through a surcharge that would amount to as much as $.0354 from ELA-M3.  Texas Eastern proposes to begin recovery in June so as to extend the recovery period from 12 months (Dec-Nov) to 18 months (Jun-Nov), which will lower the level of the surcharge.

We'll review the filing to see if there are any grounds for protest / comment.  These types of dollars are usually "rubber-stamped" by FERC for pass-through but the filing to change the recovery time period may give us some grounds to protest the recovery.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional information.

Thanks,
Suzanne
