Imbalance update:  I spoke with Mike Bilberry and confirmed that this deal
really is Energy In/Energy Out.  We should not be impacted in any way by a
reallocation to correct PVR percentages or a C5 correction at the plant.
HPL/ENA should rereceive the same volume, Dth for Dth at the residue or at a
redelivery point such as Lobo/Agua.  I have left a message for my counterpart
at Duke and am requesting that they deliver to us, somewhere, an additional
20,125 Dth/Day for the month of December to balance us out.

Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.  I will advise
everyone upon their agreement to payback so that our respective positions
reflect the additional supply.
