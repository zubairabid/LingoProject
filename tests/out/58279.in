All,
I have included an outline of the move for this weekend, we will commence approx 2:00pm Friday when the power tading market closes. We need everyone (except the 24x7 groups & office of the chair) to be off the phones by 6:00pm. These times have been agreed with the department heads and we will be flexible where necessary upto 6:00pm
We will open the floors between 2:00pm & 5:00pm on Sunday, for the following groups to come in and test their systems and telephones, the users are being selected by the heads of departments and we have support staff on-hand to deal with problems and questions.
25 Gas traders / admins
25 Power traders / admins
10 Gas back office /admins
10 Power back office / admins
Office of the chair and admin staff
Business contingency and fall back positions will be in-place on Sunday
