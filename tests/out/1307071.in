I believe that SDI's lawyer may have been telling the truth when he said that
Enron was not brought in to the Cleveland settlement discussions, because SDI
and McDonald were doing a larger deal with Schultes.  We refused to join in
their deal in Los Angeles (because it left the Cleveland action alive.)  And,
during the last 45 days, McDonald and SDI have been dismissing claims against
Schultes all around the country.  Something larger does appear to be going on.
