I realize this is short notice, but I would really like for you all to attend
this meeting from 2:30 to 4:00 or 4:30 pm tomorrow at Bridgeline's offices.
Their people are trying to get up to speed on the systems and the business.
Most are accountants from Texaco, and there is a common theme - they think in
accounting deadlines, after the end of the month, and most do not have
experience with a trading business.  I assume they have experience with the
asset world.  I am sure they are very capable employees, but they have so
much on their plates, and we can help.  I realize that we lost some time
today with the system outage as well as it is the end of the month.  However,
we will never migrate our services to their infrastructure if we don't get
this moving.  So I would like to do a "chalk talk" tomorrow with them - very
simply, starting at ground zero.  We need to explain Sitara, CPR, TAGG and
ERMS as well as Unify and POPS.  The perspectives need to be very clear
also:  Marketing, Onsystem Pipeline and Offsystem business.

I know that Mike, Daren and Rita (I think) will be there.  Tommy Yanowski
will be there also.  If possible, I would like Mary, Pat and Lisa to join us
also.  Steve, we will not do an in-depth discussion of Risk as Jay came from
ENA, and they are not a mark-to-market company.   We will cover this more
from an accrual basis.  So I don't think your time would be best utilized,
but you are more than welcome if you want to attend.  Mary, I think your
background and system knowledge will be beneficial even though you have not
been involved in the Bridgeline transactions.  Pat, it would be helpful for
you to be there to provide any insight you might have, but I know it will be
tough for both you and Daren to be gone.  Exercise your judgement.

Please let me know ASAP if you can swing being there.  I know it is
difficult, and the room will be tight, but I appreciate any support you all
can provide.  I will be in and out myself.  Thanks in advance for your help.
