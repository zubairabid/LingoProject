Enron North America and Enron Canada are still providing IT and Back Office Services to several parties.  Beth has expressed some concerns about the estate's ability to be able to support  a production trading environment once a split of applications and hardware is made between NETCO and the estate.  Given this we need to make some decisions as to how to best handle these services agreements.  Here are some suggestions:

Peggy Hedstrom, in Calgary would like to assign the Enron Canada Master Services agreements to NETCO and continue to service those via that entity.

Bridgeline, which is a JV in which ENA owns a 40% interest, currently has no way that they can support themselves.  They are totally dependent on Enron for everything from email, internet, network services and office applications as well as trading, risk and back office applications.  If there are concerns about the estate's ability to support Bridgeline then it may be in Enron's best interest to assign this agreement to NETCO.

AEP/HPL is more of a stand alone operation.  They have their own infrastructure in place and currently provide for their own email and office support services.  They have also brought up with their own version of our SCADA system and are in the process of trying to bring up their own version of our Pipeline Operations system.  If we sell them our version of PGAS to support their measurement operations they will then try to tie these applications into their own Trade Blotter, Open Link Financials and Altra.  Their goal was to try and have all of this in place by sometime in June of this year.  Given all of the Commercial conflicts with AEP regarding the sale of HPL it may make the most sense to leave this agreement with the estate and suggest that AEP try to be stand alone ASAP.  That way if the estate defaults on the service agreement then they can at least manually rekey information from one system to another until they have put in their own integration between the applications listed above.

Please let me know if you have any comments or if it makes sense to put together a meeting to discuss the issues of Service Agreements.
