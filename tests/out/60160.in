Brad,

We may consider targeting a wide audience.  Since these turbines are not the technology of choice for many large corporate entities, our target audience may need to be somewhat more diverse.  Our only prerequisite for purchase is the ability to raise $31 MM (plus option fees).

I have two primary documents.  One is the spec sheet and a general scope.  The other is a turbine purchase agreement.

A counterparty can have two options:  One is to contact us to provide a bid.  There would be no price assurance or exclusivity in this case.  Their other choice is to accept our offer on a turbine option contract.  For $1 MM, they would have a 30 day call on the turbines, during which they would be permitted to conduct their due diligence.  The $1 MM buys them price assurance and an exclusivity period.

It may be a nuance, but our offer price is on the call not the actual turbine.  Is this consistent with EOL's format?
