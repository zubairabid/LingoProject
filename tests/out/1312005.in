OK Kerry  -- here is the high level summary

My net cuts for Global Services   -- across the DPR team, Global Counterparty, Contracts and OPM -- by Business unit

EGM  900,000
EIM   300,000
EA    100,000   -- less dpr service -- no global standards reporting etc
----------------------
$  1,300,000   total cut  -- pure salaries  -- not loaded with benefits or any overheads/bonus or anything

You will have to net off severance for about $400,000 worth of salary that is 8 employees  ($224k for 8 people at avg $28k per person)  the rest are contractors or positions that were budgeted for which we will not fill, or people who will be re-deployed into EES  I assume that HR gave you some average rate

Kerry will assume you will add the rest on to this


EES there is no net savings  -- for every single person that I am severing  -- we are re-deploying someone from EIM or EGM into the role.    But there will be severance costs for another 20 ($560k at avg $28k per person)     people who's salaries total about $ 900,000   --- this should be the same severance that was avoided in EIM or EGM -- as their people are moving over to fill these spots
