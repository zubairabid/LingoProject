Dear UT Team:

As you know, we conducted our intern interviews at UT last week.

We interviewed almost 50 candidates during round 1 (thanks to Chris Sherman,
Jim Cole, Hunter Shively, Dwight Fruge', Stan Dowell, Rick Carson, and Kim
Chick), and our round 2 interviewers (Rick Causey, Brent Price, Mark Lindsey,
and Mike Deville) have selected the following 11 candidates for a summer

offers to each of them and they should receive their offer letters by the end
of next week.

Thanks to each of our interviewers for their help and long hours!
