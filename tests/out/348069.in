Wed. we will be filing our protest (plus, many others will be filing
protests) that Entergy's filing is discriminatory and not the way to solve
transmission constraints issues.  Actually, Entergy proposes solving
constraint issues by not allowing parking at a generation only control area
and by eliminating netting--both items that we won last year at NERC against
TVA.  Entergy's filing is a proposal to solve "partial paths", which they
call "fictional" sinks/sources via elimination of the path.

Now MAIN and ComEd (specifically stating that it doesn't want us to sink at
the Enron soon-to-be control area in ComEd) have raised this issue.  We are
working on a response to ComEd and Dick may be going out to meet with them
too.

Finally, DUKE AND CINERGY both told me that while their marketing/traders
greatly want to protest Entergy's filing, their transmission side won't let
them.  So both are filing plain vanilla interventions.  We need to again be
looking for any NERC email blasters that go out from marketers of utilities
now and into the summer, similar to what SCEM (Southern's marketer) sent out
last year complaining about TLRs.  If you see any of these, let me know so we
can possibly send them to FERC staff because it is very difficult to get them
to take a public position.  PECO Energy is filing a good protest to Entergy.
