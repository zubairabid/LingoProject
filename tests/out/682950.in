Summary first, comments second.
Short read of SDGE proposal:
Plan establishes procurement and recovery strategy for SDGE as standard offer provider post Jan 1, 2003.  Procurement plan would be submitted annually for PUC approval with ongoing discussions to allow modifications to plan as needed.
Supply side of plan comes from URG (SONGS, QFs, PGE and other bilateral contracts - about 1/4 of total requirement), state resources (DWR and CPA), and market purchases (short and long term, fixed and variable, peaking) in that order.  -     SDGE takes no responsibility for administering state-owned resources.  Takes only what is needed and not obligated to take anyting more.  Long term products procured through RFPs.
-    Most details of portfolio kept confidential, except load forecast and RFP process.
Demand side of plan is load forecast, net of DA load.
-     DA load is identified through 90 day open enrollment period that starts 180 days before procurement plan is submitted.  Over 20 kW customers commit to 5 year departure.  Smaller customers commit to 1 year departure.
-    Departing customers pay exit fee for DWR and URG costs.  Premature returns pay re-entry fee and spot pricing.
-    Departures not official until PUC rules on the procurement plan.
Cost recovery through a PCAM (Procurement Cost Adjustment Mechanism).  Two components - energy (including ancillary services), and a balancing account adjustment component.
-    each component is adjusted monthly.
Other policy gems thrown out for discussion:
-    State must maintain strong procurement role; e.g. administer DWR contracts, consider combining generating assets under State portfolio management
-    PA-style auction of standard offer, with departing customers treated the same as DA.
Direction of comments (through AReM would seem fine):
Departure should not be limited to open enrollment periods.  During open enrollment, certain amount of load, at least amount that would be supplied by market purchases, should be designated as fee-less.  During other times, departure is permitted with appropriate exit fee.
Appropriate exit fee must be based on truly unavoidable costs and have not already been recovered through AB 1890 CTCs.
Re-entry fee should only be required if returning customer wants PCAM.  Otherwise, customer gets spot price and there is no fee.
5-yr and 1-yr commitment periods mean nothing and should be eliminated.  Returning customers get spot price or buy their way into PCAM.
Pricing data used for PCAM should not be confidential.  Customers should know their risk exposure when buying PCAM - what's the portfolio, term of contracts, pricing volatility, etc.  Otherwise customer is kept in dark, not knowing pay they are paying for.
Long term solution is auction or similar disposition of customers to market.  Solution is not for state to take over power plant management.
Sue - let's you and I talk first.  Is AReM going to comment?
