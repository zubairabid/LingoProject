Jim et al.:
I heard from Robert Michaels that Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE) may be
interested in sponsoring his study.
Wayne Brough at CSE plans to approach EPSA and others to gauge interest.  He
said that their president Paul Beckner is scheduled to meet with Steve Kean
in mid- September on this and other topics.
Wayne said there was some thinking to let Ken Malloy front the study but have
CSE write a grass roots version given their niche.  Malloy does not want to
fund raise for his part, however, so CSE might be responsible for both if it
gets done.
SO, everything is still in the planning stages.
