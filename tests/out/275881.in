Dear Managers,

Now would be an optimal time to assess the progress or lack of progress of your staff members as it relates to Mid-Year PRC.

I encourage you to do the following:

Ask you direct reports for their current 2001 goals along with a status report of their progress.
Ask your direct reports for a brief self evaluation of their contributions to date for PRC purposes
Sit down with your direct reports and talk to them about their areas of improvement that need to addressed and goals that need to be met that will impact the employee at Mid-Year PRC if they are not attained.

This will reduce the chance of miscommunication between you and your employee when you have to deliver difficult messages or where there may be disagreement about current performance levels.      As you already know by now, Frank and I always ask if the issues that are a part of the PRC have been addressed and documented in the recent past with the employee.     Please call us if we can be of any assistance with this process.
