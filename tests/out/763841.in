Well, I can't believe another year has passed, but it has.  Sunday, October 28th  is the Juvenile Diabetes Walk for a Cure! Again this year, I'm recruiting walkers for my team or simply asking for your support.  I know you hate to hear those pleading calls for more of your money, but I'm going to ask anyway - most of you know me well!  You see I have to.  As an insulin dependent diabetic myself, it is my obligation to do what I can to support every effort to find a cure for this disease which affects so many adults and children!  I know many of you see me deal with this disease everyday as I face it each time I put food in my mouth.  I follow my meals religiously with a shot of insulin along with several finger sticks a day to check my blood sugar.  It was only 4 years ago that I was diagnosed with diabetes, but your dollars are making a difference.  Within 2 years, they are expecting to be able to release insulin that can be inhaled which would eliminate the painful injections.
I know that you have been inundated with organizations seeking your support to fund their projects and this has been especially true this year, but I hope that you will consider JDF one of the few that you continue to support as I do.  Please consider joining my team or one of the many other Enron teams and help us find a cure for Diabetes!  An Enron JDF t-shirt will be given to each walker or sponsor who contributes $25.00 or more!  If $25.00 isn't in your budget, you can purchase a "JDF Shoe" for only $5.00 and it will be posted at the Big E Caf on October 26th.  As always, your contributions are matched by Enron!  Thanks for your support and I hope to see you on the 28th!
