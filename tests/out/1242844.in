On 2-19-02 , that afternoon we discovered by chance our pagers were not working.  Early the next morning (2-20-02 I called Unity Pager out of Hobbs to inform them of the situation. They told me that Frank Sosa was trying to clean up pagers that was not being used to get them off our bill.  And that all our pagers were ones they didn't know who they belong to. I faxed a copy of the teams names and their pager numbers, she then told me they would be turned back on that day. (2-20-02  The morning of 2-21-02 we tried our pagers and they still did not work.  I then called Unity pager, and told them that our pagers still did not work.  Heather (Unity employee) told me they see why they are not working and to give them 5 or 10 minutes and they would be on.  Three hours later still our pagers did not work. I called and talked to Heather again, when she informed me that they do not cover our area on the plan that we are on, and to change the plan and get our pagers working would have to get the OK from Frank Sosa.  And they are going to have a meeting with Frank on 2-22-02.  So until further notice you can not reach ANY San Juan Team member via pager till something is done to get them working, or we can get another paging company, our team has had alot of problems over the past year with our pagers.

I have called OCC to inform them also.
