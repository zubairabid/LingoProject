Great news!

Yesterday, Dana Jonusaitis, Section Director, sent me a message (see
attached) letting me know that the ABA Board of Governors has approved
the Section's request (also attached) to seek a grant of up to $25,000
from the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) to develop a
public service project. The subject areas for this year's grants will be
announced by the CEC in early 2002.  (Last year's grant subject areas
were marine protected areas and children's health and the environment).

Once the CEC announces the proposed subject areas, I will contact the
relevant Committee public service vice chair to enlist their aid in
putting together the grant proposal and the public service project.

For more information on the CEC and the grant process, please check out:

Happy holidays!
