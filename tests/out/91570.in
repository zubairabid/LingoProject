I've gone ahead and entered the counterparty name "Sierra Pacific Industries,
Inc." in Chris Foster's deal #573679, in the interest of moving it along
through the confirmation process. (The deal was done on 4/6 and flowed on
4/10.)
I spoke with Bob Ellery (Sierra) yesterday and he seemed fine with the name
we have in our system, although I'm sure he's not the final authority. Then I
spoke with the Confirms group today and they were ready to get the deal off
of their new deal report. So, since I haven't heard anything to the contrary,
I changed the deal from it's "new counterparty" status.
Please let me know if this presents a problem for any of you.
