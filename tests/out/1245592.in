In yesterday's group meeting, it was noted that a number of people have been notified by their existing parking garage that their parking rights will soon be terminated.  If you are in this predicament, and alternative arrangements have not yet been provided to you, please email me back with the details including your current garage name and expected date of parking termination.  I will use this information in an effort to find alternative arrangements.

I hope everyone found yesterday's update beneficial.  Until we get the "peanuts back on the airplanes" I would encourage you to bring issues to me such that we can attempt to get them resolved.

Thanks
