Hi Paul.  Thank you again for your support. I am going to revise and
check the info. with my notes and i will revert to you.
I am now 100% sure that we can complete this deal. Is unbelievable how
inefficient is the actual discharge operation in the three terminals in P.R.
Also, Empire Gas expressed that if they receive an incentive on top of
their actual economies they have no problem in using ProCaribe .
However, they do not want to depend on Enron for their supplies.
As agreed,  once we complete the material for the next meeting
with PDVSA we will discuss it with you and Greg.
Regards,
