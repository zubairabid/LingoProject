Bisti
Unit went down at 14:15 was thought to be a ESD but as it tuned out is was a BSD. After the team
member arrived it was determined that there was no fire. They began to work on and reset the fire eye
the team tried to start the unit to no avail. After trouble shooting and try to start the unit a couple of time
it was determined that the PLC programmer was bad. they then sent to Bloomfield for the new spare
After installing the new one and determining it was bad also. It was time to call Solar after talking to their
office and finding out that all their Reps are all in Wyoming, We talk to their specialist and they said we needed
a new PLC. We were back to square one by this time it is midnight and PLC are hard to find this late at night so
we called on a good friend  ( Northwest Pipeline ) they had one. We then got it to Bisti and installed it.
The Unit came right up, Just to have another BSD,  We were down again. After more testing,And the winding temps
being real hot the team thinks the motor has problems. So we will start testing it as so as possible and we get help
out there. We will keep you informed

Thanks Team San Juan
