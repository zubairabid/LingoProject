Dear POCCC Members:
Attached are the minutes from the August and September meetings of the
POCCC Condo Association.  I'll try to get these out to everyone on a
more timely basis in the future (or get Becky to do them!).  Almost
everything discussed  in the minutes has moved forward substantially
since the meetings, so if you have any specific concerns or questions,
you had better call somebody.  There is no set schedule for Association
meetings, but we'll have agendas sent out by e-mail at least a couple of
days before the meeting date.  We will very likely have a meeting in
October.
Several people have been asked by their insurance companies to provide
the compliance certificate to get windstorm coverage (Form WPI - 8).  I
have it and can fax it to you if you need it.  Let me know.
This last weekend was great.  Main Lodge is nearly done.  Great
countertops!  Big screen football on Saturday with Franklin and Aplin
and everyone they ever met.  Mass barbeque Saturday night.  Kim and Glen
Wind (with a handfull of volunteers) assembled the Kid's Lodge furniture
and painted the walls.  The room looks great and is ready for action.
We're working on the pool fence.  Original proposal for blinds is
apparently coming to fruition, in about 2 weeks.  Closing packages are
out.  Final cash calls are also out and need to be paid.  Working on
final punchlist for entire project (not inside your unit).  Working on
interviewing caretakers and preparing job description.  Trash is getting
picked up and grass is being mowed.
