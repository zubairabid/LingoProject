Andersen Warns Of Increased State/Federal Tensions
The likelihood of friction between state and federal regulators increasing
over deregulation plans if states slow or walk away from retail competition
is just one of several important implications resulting from the ongoing
shockwave that has rolled through the Western energy markets, according to a
new report issued Tuesday by Andersen.
The report, "Energy Crisis in the Western United States: Lessons for
Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields," was unveiled by Andersen's
North American Energy Consulting Practice at a Washington, D.C., briefing.
David Jermain, principal with Andersen's North American Energy Consulting
Practice, noted that the report identifies eight overriding implications
emanating from the Western energy crisis. "These aspects of the California
virus will shape the longer-term operations of the Western grid, the regional
and national economy, domestic energy policy and the industry's evolution,"
he added.
The eight implications singled out in the Andersen report are:
Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk
Reduced investor confidence
Contributing factor in economic softening
Increased pressure on the Western grid
Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies
Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions
Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage; and
Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies
"Tensions and differences between state and federal regulators raise the
specter of repeating the regulatory and political conundrum California's
investor-owned utilities have been facing," Jermain said. If federal
initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets remain regulated, a
crucial question emerges, namely whether state regulators will pass-through
higher wholesale costs if they should occur. "Tensions between state and
federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow if states delay or
abandon retail competition," Jermain stated.
As to the California situation creating increased pressure on the Western
grid, Jermain noted that "Even as capacity increases and demand reductions
work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have long-term
implications for the Western grid." Such implications include a realistic
chance that California could become an "energy island" as a result of
near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California,
according to the Andersen report. Also, there could be increased emphasis on
security control to protect against overall Western grid failure as
sub-regions have difficulties.
Along with yesterday's report, Andersen also issued the results of an
Andersen survey of senior executives from 16 non-California utilities
detailing their views of the implications of the California power crisis for
their companies and the industry. The survey was conducted between February
19, 2001, and March 2, 2001, by Knowledge Systems & Research Inc. of
Syracuse.
On the deregulation front, nearly all the executives surveyed said they
believe recent California events will slow the pace of deregulation over the
next five years for states that have not begun or finished writing
restructuring legislation. None believe that it will result in advanced
states deciding to re-regulate markets, although many states will review
their legislation to assess the risk of duplicating California's current
situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it.
As to legislation at the federal level, the survey found that few executives
suggest that the California situation will spark national energy
policy/legislation. Other executives believe that it will be a continuing
issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to
pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline.
Turning to company strategies, most of the executives surveyed do not see any
changes to their business models or strategies for generation, distribution
or supply procurement as a response to the situation in California. However,
many have, among other things, expanded their risk management programs,
reduced spot market purchases and started emphasizing long-term supply
contracts. Those executives facing price caps are rethinking their stance on
them, according to the Andersen survey.

ower companies and regulators must take steps to avoid spread of California
Power virus: Andersen analysis

WASHINGTON, D.C., April 24, 2001 * A &new virus spawned in California8 poses
formidable challenges requiring new strategies on the part of power
companies, regulators and policymakers to contain and reverse its damage,
according to Energy Crisis in the Western United States: Lessons for
Navigating Regulatory and Market Minefields, a new Andersen report released
today.
&The implications for the development of competitive energy markets go far
beyond the Western United States,8 Andersen,s national utility practice head
Matthew D. Smith told a Washington briefing. &Unfortunately, California has
taught the nation that regulatory and political barriers can create and
sustain an energy crisis.8

&California has demonstrated that the risks in the electricity industry, if
not properly acknowledged and managed, can simultaneously and profoundly
impact all market participants. To be effectively managed, these risks need
to be exposed, assumed or shared, measured and monitored. When they are
hidden or ignored, all parties can potentially suffer. A shared, integrated
view of these risks, and a strategy for their assumption and management, is
critical to avoiding rapid value destruction within the energy market,8 Smith
said.

An Andersen survey of senior utility executives outside California, also
released at the briefing, indicates most utility companies believe they
inoculated themselves against the California virus so that it is unlikely to
affect their operations beyond slowing the pace of deregulation and
increasing investor scrutiny. However, based on the potential implications it
sees of the California situation, Andersen believes a series of booster shots
are advisable for power companies and regulators. &To deliver reliable
service at a predictable cost in today,s environment, companies must focus on
market integration by developing new and innovative relationships between
suppliers, customers, employees and investors ) while working with government
officials and regulators to chart a smoother transition to a deregulated
power market,8 according to Smith.

Eight Implications
The Andersen report identified eight overriding implications emanating from
the Western energy crisis that are shaping the longer-term operations of the
Western grid, the regional and national economy, domestic energy policy and
the industry,s evolution:
1. Increased deregulation uncertainty and risk ) Tension and differences
between state and federal regulators raise the specter of repeating the
regulatory and political conundrum California,s investor-owned utilities have
faced. If federal initiatives open wholesale markets while retail markets
remain regulated, a crucial question is raised: Will state regulators
pass-through higher wholesale costs if they should materialize? Tensions
between state and federal regulators over policies on deregulation will grow
if states delay or abandon retail competition.
As wholesale markets are deregulated and RTOs begin operating, the prudence
principles that state regulators have used for many years may have to be
changed. For example, if FERC and RTO monitors determine that deregulated
wholesale markets operate fairly, prices derived from those markets must be
considered reasonable. If so, these costs should be allowed into
state-regulated retail rates without regard to the prudence principles state
regulators have used for years. Therefore, utilities, traditional burden of
proving costs are or are not justifiable shifts to regulators.

2. Reduced investor confidence ) Prior to deregulation, stringent prudence
review and disallowance of generation costs in the rate base made regulatory
risk largely uncontrollable, killing IOU interests in most new investment. A
major purpose of deregulation was to create an environment in which risk
could be managed, but California,s political and regulatory environment
provides only a limited ability to manage risks. The confidence and
perceptions needed to support investment decision-making will be slow to
return given the approach of the state to remedy the crisis.

3. Contributing factor in economic softening ) Uncertain energy reliability
and higher costs can drive-out marginal businesses, cause healthy companies
to constrain expansion, and lead new entrants to question whether to make new
investments. As such, an extended energy crisis contributes to inflation
pressures and may slow economic growth.

4. Increased pressure on the Western grid ) Even as capacity increases and
demand reductions work to resolve the California crisis, these solutions have
long-term implications for the Western Grid. These include a realistic
possibility of California becoming an &energy island8 as a result of
near-term reduction in available regional resources for export to California;
increased emphasis on security control to protect against overall Western
grid failure as sub-regions have problems; RTO requirements to strengthen
locally available supplies to bolster overall system reliability; longer-term
development of new plants using plentiful coal resources and clean coal
technology will alter the pattern of imports into California; and the
emergence of Mexico as a major supplier to southern California and Arizona,
contributing to a bifurcation of the Western Grid into northern and southern
markets

5. Unbundling failures that push companies back to portfolio strategies ) For
California investor-owned utilities, unbundling has achieved neither the
least-cost solution sought by regulators nor value maximization targeted by
investors. This necessitates a reevaluation of portfolio management
strategies potentially involving generation, transmission, power trading and
marketing, and retail businesses in multiple geographies serving multiple
markets.

6. Ineffectiveness in changing siting and development restrictions )
California,s retail price caps and multiple explanations for the crisis have
left accelerated siting processes and environmental standards changes open to
challenge by various interests. In addition, limiting application of new
siting orders only to small generators contributes to uncertainty and
investor hesitancy.

7. Procurement management that alters user-utility negotiating leverage )
Competitive markets compel participants ) suppliers, marketers, large
industrial buyers, etc. ) to strategically manage procurement as a critical
value-driver. Because risk is explicitly shared and always has the potential
of shifting advantage to either seller or buyer, the sophistication of
negotiations and contracts increases as competitive markets evolve.

8. Increased emphasis on distributed generation and new technologies )
California,s reliability and price challenges have triggered a re-emergence
of energy crisis measures from the 1970s. End-users are investing in
solutions they control, and the distributed generation market is being
aggressively developed among large retailers, industrial users and
residential customers. This makes possible the development of microgrids
connecting consumers in local areas and related changes in traditional grid
systems, from modifications in interconnection agreements to changing
definitions of reserve margins and system reliability.
Industry Executives, Response
Senior executives from sixteen non-California utilities with a combined
market capitalization over $120 billion and $145 billion in revenues
responded to an Andersen survey with their views of the implications of the
California power crisis for their companies and for the industry. The survey,
conducted between February 19, 2001 and March 2, 2001 by Knowledge Systems &
Research, Inc. of Syracuse, found that the companies are observing the
California situation carefully, expect a slowing ) but not a turnaround -- of
deregulation, and believe their internal plans and preparations are on-target
for the changing environment:
Deregulation - Nearly all executives believe recent California events will
slow the pace of deregulation over the next five years for states that have
not begun or finished writing restructuring legislation. None believe that it
will cause advanced states to re-regulate markets, although many states will
review their legislation to assess their risk of duplicating California,s
current situation and make any changes necessary to avoid it.
National legislation - Few executives suggest the situation will initiate
national energy policy/legislation; others believe it will be a continuing
issue but, because of state-to-state variances, Congress will be unable to
pass any comprehensive measures or force states to a restructuring timeline.
Some expect additional state-level legislation.
Company strategies - Most do not see any changes to their business models or
strategies for generation, distribution or supply procurement as a response
to the situation in California. However, many have expanded their risk
management programs, reduced spot market purchases, begun emphasizing
long-term supply contracts, planning new power generation capacity, and
started hedging with futures trades. Those facing price caps are rethinking
their stance on them
Investor scrutiny ) Many executives indicate their shareholders are aware of
the situation and investors -- particularly institutional investors -- are
more heavily scrutinizing their actions. Many say news coverage has prompted
retail, commercial and industrial customer skepticism of industry
restructuring.
Transmission deregulation - Many executives agree the California situation
will increase interest in FERC,s regional transmission organizations (RTO)
deregulation effort.
Utility Company Action Items
Both to guard against a sudden California cascade and as a potentially
powerful competitive thrust, forward-thinking utilities should bolster their
basic preparedness with a variety of tactics -- or inoculations --
specifically aimed to combat a potential California power virus, according to
Andersen partner Mark Moskovitz:
Improve procurement management and risk management capabilities - To manage
exposure to volatile supply and demand shifts, organizations must be sure
that comprehensive and clear supply procedures, controls, decision points,
risk limits and communications are in place.
Plan and design innovative rate and pricing structures ) Companies and
regulators must focus on communicating price signals that create value for
both the customer and the provider. Innovative rate and pricing structures
that more closely tie the customer,s price to the real cost of supply will
better signal the value of the service as well as providing more accurate
information upon which both end user and supplier can make decisions.
Increase emphasis on demand side management (DSM) strategies ) In addition to
new pricing strategies to help achieve and maintain supply-demand
equilibrium, companies must now focus on employing more extensive and
innovative demand side management programs. These programs may offer
significant benefits with limited risk to both the customer and energy
supplier.
Assess the supply and generation dynamics in adjacent jurisdictions )
Companies must take a broader view ) beyond typical geographic market
definitions -- of the economics of generation and related business decisions
in an increasingly volatile market in which supply will follow the best
prices.
Develop contingency plans for the continued deferral of new generation
capacity ) In the face of potential ongoing generation capacity shortages,
companies and regulators must be prepared to move with a portfolio of
strategies to meet demand, including for example DSM, flexible pricing and
distributed generation. In addition, they should explore efficiency-improving
upgrades to existing facilities and seize any opportunity to accelerate
near-term construction plans.
Proactively address potential organizational disruption ) As regulatory and
economic changes continue to churn the industry waters and companies adjust
and/or restructure, they must be highly cogniscent of, sensitive to, and
directly address employees, concerns with information about the company,s
future and theirs,.
Industry/Regulatory Lessons
There are also a number of broad primary lessons the electric power industry
-- nationally and internationally -- should take away from its first major
domestic test case in deregulation and restructuring, according to Andersen
principal David O. Jermain:
Simplify market design.
Build a continuing role for regulators.
Maintain communications with multiple constituent interests.
Prepare contingency plans for extreme stress conditions.
Couple real-time retail pricing with transparently priced wholesale
competition.
Provide special incentives for RTO investment, formation and development.
Break down regulatory and political barriers to market signals and responses.
