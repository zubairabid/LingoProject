On Friday, May 11th, the SCAQMD approved several significant changes to the
RECLAIM Program.  The key elements of these modifications are as follows:

For existing large power plants (greater than 50MW): bifurcation from the
rest of the RECLAIM market, requiring installation of Best Available Retrofit
Control Technology (BARCT) through compliance plans (to be installed no later
than 2003 for boilers and 2004 for turbines), and a temporary mitigation fee
program.  Any emissions in excess of their allocation can be offset by the
payment of a mitigation fee of $7.50 per pound ($15,000 per ton) to the
District, which will in turn invest the money in NOx emission reduction
projects to mitigate the air pollution effects.   These rule changes include
an environmental dispatch provision which requires prioritization of the use
of cleaner emitting equipment first;
Initiation of a temporary, limited, pilot RECLAIM Air Quality Investment
Program (AQIP) for new power plants and structural buyers, allowing access to
mobile and area source credits;
Development of four new pilot credit generation rules which are voluntary and
are applicable to a specific type of mobile or area source emission reduction
project, as summarized below:
- Rule 1631 applies to diesel-fueled captive marine vessels where the
existing marine engine is repowered or replaced with a new diesel-fueled
marine engine.
- Rule 1632 applies to marine vessels that are anchored in district harbors
or ports that use electric power in lieu of auxiliary diesel engines to
provide power for lights, ventilation, loading, offloading, and other
"hotelling" operations.
- Rule 1633 applies to truck or trailer refrigeration units that are mounted
on a truck body or trailer container that use electric power in lieu of
auxiliary diesel engines while at distribution centers.
- Rule 2507 applies to diesel-fueled engines that are replaced with electric
motors that are used to power agricultural pumps.

Summary of Impact of Modifications:

The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) introduced these new
rules to reduce the impact of CA's electricity crisis ( the need to increase
generation) on the RECLAIM trading credit (RTC) market and to do their part
to facilitate increased electricity supply.  These amendments are intended to
stabilize RTC prices by increasing supply, reducing demand, and increasing
trading information and accuracy.

There is one major "IF" built into these rules.  It involves the mitigation
fee program for existing large power plants.  IF the AQMD fails to produce
adequate reductions for the mitigation fee program, power producing
facilities would have allowances deducted from future year allocations to
cover their emissions.  In otherwords, they would be able to run at higher
levels this year, but may face severe curtailments in future years.

I do think there are a couple of noteworthy precedence within these rules.
One is the increased validity and recognition of need of alternate source of
emission offsets.  This rule development had active participation by CARB and
the USEPA, who bought off on these provisions  The second is the use of the
mitigation bank for generators.  CARB has developed a similar bank for new
peaking turbines, but this program has much broader application.  And,
finally, this is the first time I've seen environmental dispatch provisions
codified.

For those of you that want more details see below.  I also have summaries of
the rules and comments on the rules.  Please give me a call if you have
questions or want the documentation.  Please forward this to anyone I've
missed.

Power Producing Facilities

The proposed rule changes will separate power producing facilities from the
rest of the RECLAIM market while energy supply issues are being addressed.
Existing power plants will not rejoin the full RECLAIM program unless the
Governing Board, in a public hearing prior to July 2003, determines that
their re-entry will not result in any negative impact on the remainder of the
RECLAIM universe or California,s energy security needs. The proposed rules
would require a compliance plan for power producing facilities with capacity
