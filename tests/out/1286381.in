Kay,
I agree with your comments on the selection of the ALJ.   The
following is our response to your two questions :              Ryan and I
believe that we can set forth a number of differences between the two cases
such as the site -specific air quality impact analysis required under the
applicable regulations;  the differences in parties to the proceedings; the
different impacts to the various petitioning local governments depending
upon their distance from the facility in question; the different phases of
discovery that the cases are presently in, and the like.  Nevertheless, the
foregoing may not be sufficient grounds to preclude the consolidation based
upon a minimal delay in the proceedings, as we understand that DEP is
proposing.
More importantly, we previously expressed our concern with the
company's current position in the Deerfield proceeding relative to the
proposed Nox limitation of 36 ppm. Because DEP has not been persuaded to
date to increase the permit limitation to 42 ppm and because Enron did not
legally oppose such a condition in the Deerfield permit, then Enron's
ability to raise such an objection at this point appears to be impaired.
(There may be an argument that Enron noted its objection within the permit
comment period, which terminated after the deadline for filing any legal
objection, and therefore Enron noted its objection on the record and no one
is prejudiced by asserting its objection within the pending proceeding at
this stage, since discovery has only just been initiated).   In light of
these circumstances,  we could advise DEP that Enron's position is that it
does not object to the consolidation as long as the trial date is in January
2002 and as long as the parties  recognize that Enron will challenge the
proposed Nox limitation of 36 ppm under backup fuel use conditions with
respect to both permits in a consolidated proceeding.
Please advise me of your thoughts.
