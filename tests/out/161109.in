Thanks Mike. We shall make the additions you noted below. SoCalGas (Eric
Nelson) will be providing testimony on retail unbundling for the utilities. I
agree with you that the mass- market retail parties should also include
complementary testimony. Although we discussed this earlier, I did not
receive any firm commitments from the retail folks that they would sponsor
such testimony - it may be an oversight on my part. Nonetheless, retail
testimony by those in the market should include a discussion of the benefits
from Greenmountain.com, Utility.com, CUB, REMAC and the others. Might I
suggest that Enron, as a large mass-marketer itself, coordinate this effort
with the other retail partners ?
In addition, I want all settlement parties to look beyond testimony to the
hearings, which are scheduled to begin in little more than a month. We will
need to make some time available during late May for practice panels
(assuming we are granted panel hearings) and individual practice
cross-examination. At the same time, we also need to start thinking about
direct cross-examination of the SCGC/TURN parties (again, assuming we decide
to engage in full cross-examination of their settlement). There is merit to
cross-examination of the opposing settlement since it is not very well
thought out, results in substantial cost-shifts, and is not consistent with
the Commission's most promising options. On the other hand, there is merit
to limiting our cross, especially of Florio, who will use the witness box to
grandstand. It's something to think about.
