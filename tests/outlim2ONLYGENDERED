Importance:  High
---------------------------------
Here is my list of some of the projects/contracts Andrea and I are involved
in or working on (recent comments are in bold):
TGS Secured Credit Facility--(Issue raised  by Don Black regarding the
feasibility of pledging linepack gas.  We need to check with Robert George on
this issue.)
Imbedded Capital Contracts--(Scott Porter raised the issue of developing a
new form of template with Andrea and asked that we discuss the issue with
Robert George.)
Distribution Contracts--The commercial group would like to have preapproved
distribution contract forms available to give to customers so that the
customer can submit them to the distribution company when electing a
commercial bypass.  Only two distributors have had their form approved by the
ENARGAS.  We are looking into what we can offer to our customers in the other
distribution territories to speed the process of finalising distribution
contracts with the LDCs to avoid long delays.
ENARGAS Expedientes--ENARGAS has issued an order to Enron to amend three of
its gas contracts to modify references to firm transportation and to unbundle
the pricing.  The ENARGAS also sent a letter to our customers which we feel
overstepped their regulatory role.  The meeting between Roberto Pensoti and
Hector Formica was held last Thursday.  Roberto had a follow up phone
conversation with Hector on Friday and had a meeting Monday morning with
Alicia Federico to get a feel for the amount of resistance we will get. We
have been given a 30 day extension to respond to the order in order to have
meetings with the ENARGAS and try to come to some resolution on this issue.
The first meeting will be scheduled early next week.
Neuquen Tax Assessment--Andrea has faxed or emailed the pertinent information
regarding the stamp tax assessment on the Technical Assistance Agreement
between TGS and EPCA to George Frumkin, Anna Sepulveda and Michelle Blaine
who will co-ordinate with TGS and Perez Companc on the strategy for
responding to the assessment.  Michelle will call TGS outside counsel today
in order to hire him to also represent EPCA.  EPCA has filed its response to
Neuquen using the arguments prepared by TGS on January 27.  Michelle Blaine
has requested information regarding what the next step by Neuquen might
possibly be.  We will look into the issue.
Tax Lobbying--Jordan Mintz and Terry Thorn are proposing a series of meetings
with government officials in late February and have asked Carlos Bastos to
see if he can also arrange a meeting with Mr. Lenicov at that time.  Issues
include determining whether the stamp tax and turnover tax issues can be
lobbied at the national level or only at the provincial level.  There is a
proposal that was floated that the turnover tax could be included in the VAT
tax scheme which might solve the problem with the turnover tax.  The focus of
the meetings is to determine how a lobbying strategy can be developed and who
should be involved in the actual lobbying process.  Jordan Mintz is handing
off the responsibility he had assumed on this issue to Jim Ginty.  Jordan has
asked Carlos Bastos to see if he can set up a meeting with Mr. Lenicov on
March 11th or 12th since Terry Thorn can be in Buenos Aires on those days.
Transportation Capacity Release Guidelines--Must review and comment on new
ENARGAS proposed guidelines by February 5.  Comments were made on February 5.
Vandenfil--Vandenfil has filed for a pre-bankruptcy proceeding which has not
yet been "opened" by the court due to the January recess.  For the last three
months Vandenfil has made their payments only after our sending them
termination notices with a two business day cure period.    The most likely
scenario during the preliminary bankruptcy period is that our contract will
be "continued" by the trustee giving us a priority in payment for ongoing
deliveries of gas.  After the preliminary bankruptcy is opened if we have not
been served notice that our contract is "continued" within 30 days we would
be allowed to terminate the contract.  One of the risks that we face with
this customer is that they may argue to the trustee that we cannot terminate
the contract claiming we are providing a public service.
Imasa Bid--Format of Enron's original proposal structure changed.  Enron and
Albanesi submitted joint termsheet to Central Puerto in November  where Enron
proposed signing two contracts with Central Puerto, one for the supply of all
the gas transportation and another for the supply for 60 percent of the gas
requirements and Albanesi proposed two contracts, one for supplying 40
percent of the supply of the gas and another for the building of the pipeline
spur.  Central Puerto is studying the proposals and has not responded as of
January 25, 1999.
Dow Pipeline Spur Feasibility Study--Enron and Dow are studying the
feasibility of building a pipeline between TGS and two affiliates of Dow.
Issues include determining whether our CEIASA shareholder and owners
agreements preclude Enron from building spurs for end users and whether spurs
that serve more than one customer can be built under current regulatory
guidelines.  Andrea will be putting together a short report based on her
meeting with Nestor Martinez.   A team meeting consisting of legal,
regulatory, commercial, credit and structuring met yesterday to discuss the
broad parameters of the Dow spur proposal.  The commercial group is preparing
a first draft of a build, operate and finance termsheet that they would like
to present to the customer on Thursday to be reviewed by Robert George.
Credit is still doing its analysis of the two proposed counterparties.
Contract Review--Preliminary gas contract reviews for Central Puerto and Ave
Fenix for Rob Rice and Federico Cerisoli.
Gas Deals:
Chauvco--20 day gas supply contract being drafted
Cerro VanGuardia--Amendment to the gas sale agreement being drafted to cover
negotiated changes to the take or pay provisions.
Bagley--Two Offer letters sent to two Bagley entities for review, Enron was
not the low bidder.  I have been asked by to look into how other "marketers"
are avoiding the turnover tax and thus be more competitive than we are.  The
customer is looking at the relative risks between firm distribution and
interruptable distribution but is running up against a deadline for actually
requesting a contract template for distribution services.  The contract is
slated to begin March 23, however, the distributor has 30 days to respond for
requests for distribution services.
Total--Spot master agreement proposed for transactions out of Neuquen.  Short
term draft offer for gas out of Chubut being reviewed by Total.  A separate
one year supply contract template supplied by Total is being reviewed.  The
customers template contains the same type of language that gave us Antitrust
trouble in the PCR contract.  Peidra Buena--Gas sale agreement for peaking
gas.    Final offer sent and Gas has started flowing.  We are now working on
a one year contract.  A termsheet has been sent to the customer.
Dow--Negotiating offer letter format for sale of gas to two Dow affiliates.
Gas deal is related to but independent of the spur issue.  A mark up of draft
has been received the end of last week, Dow indicates that further comments
are to be sent soon.
Power Deals:
We need to draft an output marketing form of contract for the purchase of
electricity.
Argentine Signatories:
Scott Neal has approved a new structure for signatories in Argentina.  I will
work with Hope Duggan firm on the new POA's.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I spoke at length today with Rod Boschee at PG&E.  The main focus of our
discussion was logistics/planning for the upcoming 4/13/99 meeting between TW
and PG&E representatives.  Mr. Boschee, as in earlier conversations this
week, did not mention the 3/25 sample results.  Rather, it was agreed (also
mandated by his boss, Bill Mazotti) that the time was ripe for a follow-on
meeting to our initial discussion in Topock back in January.  I provided
verbal notification to Mr. Boschee that Transwestern had retained an outside
contractor for purposes of a decontamination process to be accomplished
tomorrow at our filter separators.  In addition to my verbal notification, I
told him that TW would provide PG&E with a letter, just to complete the paper
trail.  I reinforced the importance of communication between the companies,
both formal and informal.  A copy of the letter I faxed to Mr. Boschee is
attached below.


Mr. Boschee will be preparing a draft agenda for the 4/13 meeting for TW to
consider.  In addition to TW providing an update on all interim as well as
long term plans for the lateral, Mr. Boschee noted two important items.
First, PG&E would like more information regarding the proposed controlled
Selexol flush.  Their concern is that the Selexol was colored initially as
the culprit in this PCB issue, and now is being considered a part of a
revised interim solution.  Secondly, PG&E would like to discuss the upcoming
filter change at its station currently scheduled for 4/29.

We've decided to meet in Las Vegas on 4/13.  The choice of Vegas seemed to be
more centralized (vs. San Francisco), as well as more convenient for those of
us travelling all the way from Houston.  PG&E is planning on having the
following personnel attend the meeting:
Rod Boschee-  Director of Contract Development
Dave Anderson-  Attorney
Mel Wong-  Project Manager, Topock Lateral project
Jody Garcia-  District Superintendent, Barstow Dist.
Tony Estrada-  Environmental
2 as-yet-to-be-named Barstow team members

Transwestern is planning on having the following personnel attend the meeting:
Jeff Fawcett- Marketing
Louis Soldano-  Attorney
Mike Nelson-  VP Operations
Rich Jolly-  District Ops
Larry Campbell-  Environmental
Bob Iversen-  Technical advisor, Selexol/PCB matters
Earl Chanley-  Engineering

The plan is to take Bill's plane from Houston, pick-up Mike Nelson in
Amarillo, meet in Vegas, and return (with drop-off in Amarillo) to Houston in
one day.  I'm coordinating the logistics with Virginia O'Neill.  My guess at
this point is that we'll plan on being in Las Vegas by 10:30 a.m., with the
meeting to begin at 11:00 a.m., a working lunch served at 12:00 noon, and
adjourn somewhere around 2:00 p.m., with a return flight of 2:30 p.m.

Lou Soldano is in receipt of a few of Bill Cordes' suggestions to the letter
that Bill will send out to Bill Mazotti that will: (1) outline the revised
Interim Plan, including the Selexol flush, (2) notify him of our initiative
to decon TW's filter/separators, and (3) reinforce our desire to meet on
4/13.  If the logistics (KEYEX meeting) can be worked out, the letter will
probably go out by Friday.

If you have any questions regarding the matters outlined above, please advise.

Jeff,
Mark Elliot in Legal here in London is concerned that there may be tax or
legal implications depending on how involved in the process London gets.  It
would be helpful to Mark if you could let him know what the problems you are
experiencing with your clearing function are and what exactly London will be
doing, this way Mark and tax can investigate.
Monday is a bank holiday in London so Mark and myself will be out of the

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Talked to Mark Hodge from the PX this morning regarding the charges on our
statement.  He said that the daily block forwards transaction fee has been
waived for July and Aug. (.02 transaction charge).  However, the tariff was
changed on May 2nd that increased the settlement (aka clearing) charges to
.03 per mwh per day.

I asked him why the daily block forwards are so expensive when we get the .01
charge as a preferred customer on the term block forwards.  He said it's
because of the costly bookout process.  I told him we do financial onlys, but
not bookouts, and restated that .03 is more expensive than brokers.  He said
that because the tariff filing of .03 was the maximum, these fees can be
negotiated away from the .03 max., especially since we don't add to the costs
of bookouts.   So, whoever among us is the queen or king of daily block
forwards, or our block forward accounts in general, I suggest we do negotiate
a lower rate on the daily schedules.

Both Brett and I tried to access the tariff on the PX website, but we
couldn't read it.  So, if someone has better clearance or web tools than us,
please let us know so we can update ours.

Hi Britt
A quick update:
1. Joint testing is being planned for the end of next week (16, 17 or 18
August). Please confirm that David Best's recommendation of Steve Jones of
APC Petroleum (UK) is acceptable to you. I understand Steve Jones will be
available from tomorrow and, if retained, should be briefed ASAP for his trip
to Singapore for the joint testing.
2. David  had directed that Neale Gregson take a statement from Eric Tan.
Neale and I have since attended with Eric and a statement is being prepared.
PacMarine is also preparing their second/supplementary report. I hope to have
both Eric's statement and PacMarine's report up to David by the end of the
week for him to give his final opinion on the merits.
3.  We have today sent to Mitsubishi the statement drafted by David.
Best regards
Matt

PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK
PRODUCT
Matt,
Subject to the views of Jim Studdert and David Best, given that we already
put underwriters on notice that there was contamination, and given that we
have worked closely with Minton's, underwriters' representatives, I would
assume that we are under no time pressure to give underwriters a  total
quantum before the joint survey  takes place; in fact, it looks like the
final determination of ECT's total quantum of damages may be impacted by the
results of the joint survey (although I would not necessarily want to say
that to underwriters at this point).
My preliminary review of the policy reflects no language in the policy which
would require ECT to immediately provide a total quantum. The policy
specifically requires, under "INSTRUCTIONS IN CASE OF LOSS", that ECT file a
claim in writing against the "delivering carrier holding him responsible as
soon as loss or damage is discovered even though the full exent thereof is
not apparent; details can be furnished later.  Such action will not prejudice
your insurance claim."  Let me know if you would like a copy of the pertinent
policy; I have already sent a copy to David.
I do have some strategy questions for David about the disposition of the
cargo currently in Thailand and will give him a call tomorrow morning at 9:00
a.m. Houston time to discuss.  Although I know that is quite late for you,
you are more than welcome to participate (just e-mail me a telephone number
at which you can be reached, or give me a call at that time).

Gerald,
I received your voice-mail regarding the LOU.
Paul Miller requested that I add some definition to the term "I-80
corridor".  The following is my language for that.
"(ii) any gas transportation pipeline or transmission system in the I-80
corridor, which corridor is defined as being three (3) miles wide on each
side of I-80,"
Paul also left me a garbled voice mail regarding another point related to the
Participation Rights section.  I haven't been able to reach him to get
clarification on that.  I don't know whether this will turn out to be a
revision or not at this time.
As you mentioned there may be revisions required in the "Employee Matters"

upcoming elections for members in his party, as well as the 2002 governor
election and knows that his decision may cost himself and other members of
his party election wins. Also, there is now talks that during August 21st PUC
meeting the governor will suggest rate rollback for San Diego  to July 1998

On Friday, August 4 JB and I had a discussion re: engaging Wisvest in a
dialogue to resolve some of the major issues around the San Antonio project.
In that discussion I reiterated what was discussed at the 8/2/00 Board
meeting which was:  a) we needed to finalize the numbers re: the WMI royalty
renegotiation; b) verify the expected EPC costs to complete the project; c)
revise the project pro-forma to reflect the revisions in (a) and (b) and d)
run sensitivity analyses on the level of subordination Wisvest would have to
accept in order to make the project economics viable.  In our phone
conversation on 8/4/00 we again agreed this was the right course of action to
take.  Subsequent to that call, JB had conversations w/ Derek Price at
Wisvest re: prospective meeting dates and exchanging various info re: the
project.  In another phone conversation on Monday, August 7, I specifically
asked JB whether he had sent the project pro-formas and/or other proprietary
info to Derek Price to which JB responded "no."  He said he "... sent him
summary info ... but did NOT send him the pro-forma ..."  I then asked him to
forward to me copies of everything he had sent to Derek.  What he sent to me
was some very basic e-mails and financial summary info.  I also asked Derek
to forward to me everything JB had sent to him and I got a whole lot more,
including the full-blown project model/pro-forma.  This has seriously
diminished all of our negotiating leverage!
On 8/10/00, I became aware of some efforts that appear to involve JB in
setting up a South American version of Ecogas (Ecogas S.A.) and called him to
inquire as to what was going on.  In our phone conversation JB explicitly
denied "any involvement" including any "ownership" in such an enterprise.  I
also asked JB to forward to me by Friday, 8/11/00, copies of any and all
documents, agreements, etc... relating to Ecogas S.A.  To date he has sent me
nothing but an undated DRAFT MOU as well as some misc and meaningless
correspondence (undated and/or old e-mails, etc...).  None of the info sent
is what I asked for on August 4 (complete execution copies of the MOU
regarding Ecogas S.A. including ownership interests, etc... as well as copies
of Articles of Incorporation for Ecogas S.A., etc...Who is Ecogas S.A.?
Where is it currently incorporated?  Who are the beneficial owners?  Under
what authority are you transacting business (what is your title, etc...)  JB
continues to reference "nothing has been signed, incorporated, etc..." - then
why is JB's signature evidenced on an "Amendment" to the "Memorandum of
Understanding:  Ecogas S.A. - Tortola/JCS"?
JB referenced the need to "directing our efforts to resolution of the crisis,
rather than continuing personal distractions and devisiveness."  For the past
couple of months he has been asked to generate cash by selling assets,
greenhouse gas emission credits, etc...  To the best of my knowledge Ecogas
has yet to see one penny!
As always there seems to be a direct contradiction between the "stories" and
the facts!

comments are filed as permitted under the procedures agreed to at the May 2
technical conference at FERC.  Comments are due June 30 and reply comments on
July 7.  Amoco and Burlington filed the original complaint on September 21,
1999, and requested fast-track processing under the Commission's new
complaint procedures.  Burlington is pushing to have the Commission adhere to
the fast-track processing of the complaint, maintaining that an order should
have been issued within 240 days (I don't know where they got that from -- I
can't find any such requirement), and vehemently opposed any attempts to
extend the procedural schedule.
The tone of the meeting was set when Harvey Morris, representing the CPUC,
was allowed to make a statement because he had to leave by 1:30 (the meeting
started about 12:30).  He started by saying that the CPUC was in complete
opposition to the Settlement Proposal circulated by El Paso on June 6, and
then outlined all the reasons it was unfair to California shippers and was in
violation of the '96 Settlement.
After Harvey spoke, El Paso then reviewed its June 6 settlement proposal,
which you received by e-mail, and provided some additional explanations of
assumptions, etc.  Then the parties met in individual groups to caucus on
their positions and reconvened as a group to discuss.
Of particular note was the allocation of the 360 MM/d of San Juan-only
capacity that El Paso proposed to take back from Burlington (97J4) and Amoco
(97JB).  El Paso said that it had been allocated 106 MM to the Havasu
shippers, 180 MM to the EOC shippers, and 74 MM to all others (California CD
shippers).  This was a major point of contention in most of the ensuing
discussions -- California shippers objected to EOC getting the lion's share
of the additional San Juan capacity.  Under El Paso's proposal, EOC shippers
would get 82% of their rights from San Juan and 18% from Permian, based on
BDs.  CD shippers, on the other hand, get 61% and 39%, respectively.
EOC shippers pointed out that the BDs were not actually representative of
their load.  BDs were simply a number negotiated among the EOC shippers to
allocate the costs that were allocated between EOC and California in the '96
settlement.  Certain EOC shippers suggested that their specified rights
should be based on some other calculation, such as non-coincident peak day
usage, rather than BD.
Another major issue was the proposal that full requirements shippers (FR
shippers) be given systemwide receipt point rights in addition to the
specified rights they would get based on their billing determinants (BD).  El
Paso proposed that these systemwide rights would have a scheduling priority
superior to that of a CD shipper using its capacity on an alternate firm
basis (either alternate receipt/primary delivery or alternate
receipt/alternate delivery).  Of course, the FR shippers approved of the
proposal but most other parties  objected to it.  Several suggestions were
advanced to try to reach a compromise (for instance, limiting FR shippers to
primary specified receipt point rights during Cycle 1 nominations), but none
were accepted.  Most non-FR shippers stated concerns about the practical
impact of giving FR shippers such a scheduling priority, particularly since
El Paso's interpretation was that the FR shippers would not have to nominate
any of their Permian specified rights in order to come back to the San Juan
with  the systemwide rights.
Everyone pretty much agreed that El Paso's proposal for capacity release of
receipt point rights (#4 in their write-up) was a non-starter.  It was put on
the table to address an earlier suggestion by EOC shippers that, if they
could be made economically neutral to using non-San Juan points, they might
be more receptive to some restrictions on their specified rights.  What they
were looking for was some discount for using Permian and there was some
further discussion along those lines but El Paso was not receptive, stating
that such would mean opening the allocation of costs in the rate case.
A third issue was who gets what rights at SoCal/Topock.  SoCal Gas doesn't
consider El Paso's proposal not to sell Block II turned-back capacity to its
Topock point to be of much value since FERC has said they can't anyway.
SoCal Gas is looking for a right to get out of any of its contract for which
it cannot get a specified delivery point of SoCal/Topock.  However, SoCal Gas
can't at this point commit to the group a number that it could live with as a
specified right at Topock.  Conversely, all the other CD shippers who think
they bought firm rights at SoCal/Topock are not willing to see SoCal Gas get
all the rights unless they, too, can get out of their contracts.
Fuel was the other contentious issue that seems to be a key sticking point
for certain parties -- some insist it has to remain in the settlement, others
say there can't be a settlement if it stays in.  El Paso's proposal would
move the fuel rate back to 4.85% effective 2/1/00 by changing the way they
eliminate fuel used in facilities that have been refunctionalized as
gathering.  In the filing to be effective 2/1/01, the rate would go down to
approximately 4.4% and then to 3.88% on 1/1/03.  Burlington insists they will
opt out of the settlement if they don't get relief on fuel.  Apparently, to
the extent El Paso doesn't include the costs of compressors that Burlington's
gas utilizes in systemwide fuel, they have to pay a higher fuel rate to El
Paso's gathering affiliate.  They say it has already cost them several
million dollars (I heard numbers between $9 and $27 million -- no hard data),
and they will not settle without getting something in return.
After the full group discussion and statements of position on Monday
afternoon, Rick Miles, the FERC ADR facilitator, pushed for individual
meetings between the various segments (EOC, California, producers, marketers,
El Paso), based on several parties' representations that they were willing to
continue talking.  A schedule was worked out and the individual meetings took
up the morning on Tuesday.  Just before lunch, the entire group got back
together and accepted Mr. Miles' suggestion that each segment select three or
four representatives who would then engage in a full discussion of the
issues.  He felt that with a smaller group it might be easier to reach some
understandings.  However, it apparently didn't work because he called us all
back late in the afternoon for a full group discussion, where the positions
outlined above were stated and restated.  Certain parties, when pressed,
could not agree to certain basic principles because, they said, they would
have to get input from others in their organization.  Mr. Miles expressed his
frustration that parties were at the table who didn't know what their bottom
line position was (e.g., SoCal Gas, Southwest Gas).  Following discussion by
the producers, particularly Burlington, as noted above that they would not
agree to an extension of the date for filing comments, the next settlement
meeting was scheduled after the filing dates.  Mr. Miles requested that
parties send him an e-mail note that would state their bottom line settlement
position, which he would keep confidential.  He would review all the
positions and to the extent possible put then together and float a settlement
package of his own.  He assured all that no one would be able to identify the
individual positions from his package.
One positive note at this meeting was that there was no conflict over the
pooling committee's report.  No one registered any complaints, although a few
parties who had not been at the last settlement conference indicated that
they would like to participate.
This is how I see our bottom-line position.  I would like to send it to Rick
late this week if everyone agrees.
A pooling procedure that will follow assigned priority rankings for both
market and supply with no restrictions on pool-to-pool transfers (loops
allowed).
Only San Juan receipt point rights on our Havasu contract, or, preferably,
termination of the contract so that the San Juan rights could be allocated to
others as part of a settlement.
Full requirements shippers systemwide rights above their specified point
rights would not have a higher priority than CD shippers using alternate
delivery points, although no objection to using some allocation method other
than billing determinants, such as peak day volume, to establish those
specified point rights.
Do you have any opinion about the allocation of SoCal/Topock rights?  Please
give me a call when you've had a chance to look this over.  I'm sure you'll
have some questions!  Also, we'll need to talk about what kind of comments we
want to file.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Thanks for the extremely helpful analysis Steve and John.  I'm getting a
pretty clear sense that this project isn't going anywhere as it is currently
configured.  Just to satisfy myself, though, let me throw out a couple of
observations for the group to react to, along the lines of Steve's "However"
section of his memo:
1.  Running this thing as a baseload unit won't work.  The fuel cost is a
killer.  However, I keep thinking about the $200/mwh 4 Corners spot price
someone mentioned on the phone.   Is there enough volatility at 4 Corners to
support a peaking merchant plant?  How often are those types of opportunities
available, and could a power plant in Alb. capture that upside by
transporting power to 4 Corners over PNMs system?
2.  We have been assuming that the power plant should be a baseload plant.
Someone on the phone last week had some numbers indicating that the DOE/DOD
electric load at Kirtland had a fairly high load factor.  I think we have all
assumed further that the plant should run at a high load factor to sell
surplus power into the grid (either at 4 Corners or, after N.M. elec.
restructuring, into the Alb. area).   I just found the numbers I was
remembering on the conf. call--1998 peak load was 63.6 mw, and total annual
1998 consumption was 334.5 million Kwh.  By my lawyer-math, that is about a
60% load factor for DOE.  If the DOE load is only 60% L.F., and the plant
only generates surplus power when it can capture profit opportunities that
arise when the market clearing price at 4 Corners or in Albuquerque exceeds
some benchmark rate ($.05/Kwh?  $.10/Kwh?  higher?)  the plant might run at a
30-40% load factor on an annual basis.  The question is can we reduce the
capital cost significantly by building a peaker instead of a baseload unit?
3.  Could we get debt financing for a 140 mw plant that had a baseload demand
charge contract for only 65 mw (i.e., DOE) but sold the rest of its output
into the grid only when profit opportunities arose?
4.  If the answer to 3. is no, would ENA backstop the debt financing by
signing a demand charge contract for all surplus power over and above what
the government needs?   At what price?  Based on its knowledge of volatility
and profit opportunities currently available at 4 Corners, and future profit
opportunities that will be available in Albuq. is that just a dumb bet, or
would ENA get interested if someone else (i.e., DOE) split the risk and
reward?
John, how much of the information in your analysis could be sanitized in a
way that we could provide it to Dennis Langley?  If we pull the plug on the
project, I'd like to be in a position that we could let him in on some of our
information on why the turbines we would use can't provide acceptable
economics.  I don't expect that we'd want to disclose the swap value analysis
in Steve's memo, however.
Thanks again, and I'd appreciate anyone's reaction to the above questions.
DF

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


As we discussed in Rick's staff meeting,  you can help your 7/1/00 go-live go
more smoothly, whether you are implementing financials and HR or HR only.
Here is one way.

Timekeeping, though it seems mundane on the surface, is a focal point of the
SAP integration.  Entry and coding of time populates not just payroll, but
projects and cost centers, real time.  We will now have more flexibility to
charge employee and contractor time to the areas they actually work (where
people work on more than one area at a time).  This will only happen to the
extent that the business and cost center owners drive it.  This capability is
customizable not just by business unit or company, but by cost center within
a company.

To make this work HOW YOU WANT IT TO on 7/1, each "organizational unit" (as I
said above, you can drive this in your cost center(s) only or across your BU)
needs to be clear on questions such as:

1.  Whether or not they want contractors to enter time in SAP
2. Whether you want positive timekeeping (each pay period specifying the cost
center or projects one worked on) or "exceptions" only (e.g., vacation, sick
time, etc)
3.  Whether an approval process is desired and if so, what it is
4.  Whether people will record their own time using the self service
capability eHROnline (typically more precise and less handoffs) or whether
they will continue to use a timekeeper (typically a little more convenient
for people who (a)  rarely have access to a computer or (b) work in many
different areas and are not willing/able to identify and use cost center
numbers or project codes
5.  Whether people  know the projects and cost center codes they should
charge to

Your leadership in clarifying this within your cost center and/or BU will be
instrumental in driviing the level of change you desire, as well as
minimizing the noise related to the 7/1 go -live.  We have been using a
variety of methods to communicate and drive much of this change, but the
business drive for how much to utilize the tool is determined by you.

The deadline for the first SAP time entry period is 3 pm Houston time on
Friday, June 30.

Despite all our collective efforts, I expect that it will be a few pay
periods before we get each individual clear on what level of acitivity is
desired from him by his cost center or company.  Thanks for your help in
getting through the transition period.  Please call me or Andrea Yowman if
you have any questions.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


The following procedures have been developed by Walt, Mike and myself for the
Environmental matters associated with the Texas New Mexico Pipeline System.
Please pay special attention to Item No. 5 which is not only a change in
procedure but also a huge cost savings to EOTT.
We had a good visit last Thursday with the carrier.  The local representative
and our New York claim representative were present.  We were told repeatedly
that filing timely information and claim notification was required.  We
tempered their nice but stern stance with their own internal issues regarding
the change in our local representative.  All was friendly.  The bullet point
review of the meeting's discussions is as follows and there are several
procedural points that we will adopt going forward:
Expense reporting on the known and unknown sites will be filed  monthly and
the invoices will be provided also at that time.  ( providing the invoices
with the report is a change in the procedure).  I believe that I will be able
to pull the report information off of EMS Works going forward.  Please let me
know who in the organization will be responsible for getting the invoices
together so I can coordinate this process with them.
Invoices from our vendors need to be more descriptive.  Rich was in the
meeting when this was discussed and I have asked him to take this matter up
with our vendors.  In the field, if you see that the description is weak, (
for instance, "per work order") it would be helpful for you to contact the
vendor then as opposed to sending it through the payment process.  If it is
not descriptive enough to identify the work performed, payment will be
delayed and claims processing will be slowed.  This enhancement would also
seem to help us internally identify the expense.
When we are notified of a claim, be it land owner notification of an old
site, or a new spill, a spill/claim report should be filed. I believe that
this is the information that I will be receiving from EMS Works.  If it is an
issue that requires special handling, I will be happy to take this
information directly and outside the normal channels.  One area that will
need to be addressed is an estimate of claim size with each report...and an
update of that information as the claim matures if it changes materially.  I
am not clear if this information will be available in EMS Works or not.  Can
someone get back to me on this process?
As reports or correspondence from agencies/any third party are received, we
will need to forward these on to the carrier for each claim that has been
filed. Also, I will need to forward to the carrier any reports or
correspondence that we submit to agencies and third parties. The carrier does
not want to have to come to our offices to review files if it can be avoided
and would prefer to process these claims as they mature.  As you forward
these items to me for processing, please be sure that they are clearly
identifiable as to the site/claim number.
Any new claim ( that would mean any unknown) will be noticed to the carrier.
Before dispatching anyone from Entrix ( unless this is an emergency
situation),  we will notice the carrier and they will authorize the
investigation by Entrix or any other environmental consultant.  The carrier
has the right to choose who they use, however Entrix is one of  their
approved vendors.  I understand that Entrix charges us a fee for these
investigations and this is a covered expense under the policy.  This will
also aid in the processing of the claim as the carrier will accept their
requested Entrix report as their own investigative report. These charges will
be paid by the carrier, but they need to have the claim verified and then we
need to have them dispatch Entrix to the site.  I also suspect that the fee
that we have been charged by Entrix for these matters is in excess of the fee
that the carrier pays.  Therefore it is even more critical that we have the
carrier engage Entrix and pay them.  There are as I understand 38 task orders
( estimated to be $10,000/each) currently outstanding with Entrix.  I have a
copy of these and I would like to process these through the carrier where we
have not already incurred any expense.  Who can visit with me on the actual
status of any work performance under these orders?  We will need to calculate
work performed and get immediate authorization from the carrier to have
Entrix provide the service going forward for each site.
Lawsuits and paper work will be noticed to me by Legal.
As far as the action items on current updated claims:
Roger Pennifill, the technical claim handler for AIG, was in our offices
Thursday and Friday and with the assistance of Mike Kelly reviewed the files
and talked with the field personnel as needed.
The situation with Jimmie Cooper lawsuit is the top priority with the
carrier.  Cynthia Green will get back to me within a day or so to give me
feedback on the requests that we have made to authorize the fingerprinting of
the crude oil in the Cooper's well.  This matter takes precedence over the
filing an answer on the lawsuit.   Walt Zimmerman will work with Cynthia
Green on the selection of counsel for this matter.  Unless the carrier tells
us otherwise Paul Bohannon will continue to act as lead counsel for this
matter.  Walt will provide Cynthia Green with resumes for Paul Bohannon and
the local counsel that has been suggested.
The second highest priority is Jay Anthony.  We have given Cynthia and Roger
a complete write up on this situation and they will be coming back to us to
discuss the options that we have laid in front of them.
All other claims that we discussed, will be handled as their official
notification of a claim or an update as to the magnitude of the potential
problem.
In the area of site investigation (Example Clay Osborne), we will formally
ask that Entrix be approved to do the necessary  investigative work.

practice of foreign lawyers in TX, she can't take the TX bar until she has
gotten a US law degree.  This person is very bright, personable, and

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


In view of the importance of this issue it is desirable to deal with it in
detail.

1.  The Issue

The essential issue we are focussing on is that set out in my email of May 12,
i.e. the need to avoid the possibility of a counterparty being able to claim
that the transaction is not binding because:

(a) it was outside the company's business purposes, or
(b) execution of the application was not authorized.

This issue is not unique to Japan

There is no question as to any specific Japanese laws impacting on the trading
of any of the products through the internet, including issues as to
contractual
enforceability of contracts entered into via the internet, on which we advised
on 15 March.  A copy of that advice is attached to the bottom of this email.

Neither is there any question, if the above issue is resolved, of the
Electronic
Trading Agreement and General Terms and Conditions forming part of the
contract.
(We understand Mark Taylor to be concerned on this aspect.)

2.  Enron's Practice re EOL

Our understanding is that:

* Potential customers have been sent the password application under cover
of a letter from Joseph Hirl inviting them to complete the application.
Neither
the letter nor the application form indicate who is expected to sign the form.

* Completed applications are reviewed by Enron primarily from a credit
standpoint but also, we understand from Mark Taylor, to quickly confirm the
authority of the signer (by e.g. in the case of a U.S. counterparty, checking
if
the signatory shows the title "director" alongside his name).

* If satisfied, Enron then signs the acceptance part of the application
and issues a password.

* Four applications had been received regarding Japan as of 11am today and
none has yet been approved.

3.  Business Purposes

Article 43 of the Civil Code provides that a juristic person has rights and
obligations in accordance with law and the business purposes specified in its
constituent documents.  Where a corporation enters into a contract outside its
business purposes, the contract is prima facie void.

However, if the counterparty did not know that the contract was beyond the
power
of the corporation, and was not negligent in failing to know such fact, the
contract will be enforced under Article 110 of the Civil Code.

The most prudent practice would be for Enron to obtain a copy of the
counterparty's business purposes (certified by the Legal Affairs Bureau or by
a
representative director) and form a view on whether the proposed transaction
falls within those purposes.

However, since Japanese companies' business purposes, after listing a limited
number of specific purposes, generally include a final item along the lines of
"all incidental or ancillary business", it is common for companies to not make
this inquiry except in the most major contracts.

With respect to statutory corporations, however, care is required because
often
their business purposes are in fact limited.

Accordingly, a rule of thumb solution would be: if the counterparty name does
not contain "Kabushiki Kaisha" or "Yugen Gaisha" at the end of the name, to
make
further inquiries.

4.  Authority to Bind the Company - The Law

The position in Japan is similar to that in a number of other countries in the
sense that:

(a)  Deemed Authority

The law provides for a form of execution which, if followed, entitles a party
to
presume that the company is bound.  In Japan, this involves the execution of a
contract by the company's "representative director".  This corresponds to the
presumption concerning the affixing of the company seal in some states of the
US
and in the UK, and the execution of the contract by 2 directors in Australia.

It is possible for the powers of the representative director to be restricted
by
law or the constituent documents of the corporation. (Article 53 of the Civil
Code) but if the counterparty did not know of such restriction, the contract
is
still binding on the company.

(b)  Apparent Authority

In common, with other countries, Japan has a concept of apparent authority.
Article 262 of the Commercial Code provides:

"A company shall be liable to a bona fide third party for any act done
by a director invested with any title such as president, vice president,
executive director or managing director from which it may be assumed that he
has
authority to represent the company, even in cases where the person has no
power
of representation."

Articles 37 and 38 of the Commercial Code extend the same concept to "general
managers" (so shihainin).  It is generally considered that Article 43 then
applies the concept to "an employee who has been entrusted with certain types
of
matters or specific matters."

Accordingly, in addition to persons having the titles listed in Article 262
(above), the general view is that persons having titles such as general
manager
and division manager (bucho), will be deemed to have the authority to
represent
the company for normal transactions within the particular areas of the
company's
business for which they are responsible.

It is also likely that section managers (kacho) or section chiefs (kakaricho)
have power to bind the company to a certain extent in areas for which they are
responsible.

(e)  Holding Out

Even if an employee of the company is acting outside his actual authority, if
the company has held the employee out as having authority, the company will be
bound by his/her action.

5.  Practical Considerations

In formulating an approach for Enron to take on the basis of the above law,
the
following factors are relevant:

(a)  Practice regarding Representative Director Seal

It is common for a counterparty to seek to take the advantage of the
presumption
referred to in 4(a) above by requiring the representative director's corporate
seal to be affixed (and, if contract is in English, for him to sign) or  to
insist on tracing the "chain of authority" of the signatory up to the
representative director (e.g. by power of attorney), for major or unusual
transactions.

(b)  Size of Transaction

The question is what transactions fall into the "major" or "unusual" category.

Unfortunately the cases on this do not allow a clear line to be drawn.  As in
many other countries, the answer depends on factors such as those noted in
(c),
(d) and (e) below, which vary company by company.

Accordingly, where the contract involves (or could involve) a considerable
ongoing exposure by the company, Japanese corporations would not be surprised
to
be asked for the signatory to be at a certain level, or for written
confirmation
of the signatory's authority to be obtained from a person at such level.

(c)  Size of Company

While it would be prudent and normal to insist upon the representative
director's seal being affixed to a contract of the present type in the case
of a
smaller company, it would not be normal practice to so insist in the case of a
major company such as a bank or major trading company counterparty, in which
companies lower level employees are presumed to have greater authority.

(d)  Business Department of Signatory

The counterparty is more likely to be bound under the apparent authority
doctrine if the signatory is in (and carries a title which refers to) the
relevant business department (e.g. energy), than if he is not.

(e)  Degree of Exposure

To the extent that the online products to be made available are likely to
expose
the counterparty to considerable liability, the possibility of a counterparty
in
the future disclaiming liability should not be discounted and would warrant a
reasonably conservative approach.

(f)  Recent History

However, even when faced with considerable losses during the recent economic
crisis, Japanese companies (at least major companies) have not generally
attempted to use lack of authority as a defense, presumably because of
reputation considerations.

(g) Identity of Addressee

The title of the person to whom the invitation letter is sent may be relevant.
For example, if it was sent to the General Manager of the relevant department,
but the application came from a section chief, there would be strong argument
that the company had held the section chief out as having the necessary
authority.

(h)  Internal Procedures

Since the law concerning execution by a representative director can be
considered to broadly correspond to the law concerning execution under seal in
some countries, and by two directors in for example Australia, the Japanese
rules are not out of line with those of other countries.

Accordingly, it should be necessary for Enron to take a more stringent
approach
to Japan in this respect than it does in marketing the same products in other
countries.  The procedures in place for other countries may be sufficient for
Japan as well, although some adjustment will need to be made for Japan's
unique
regime of company titles.

6.  Conservative Approach

If the online transactions are treated as a major or unusual transaction for
the
counter-party, under common practice Enron would require:

* The application to be executed under the registered seal of (and counter
signed by) a representative director, or by a person who is able to produce
documentation showing a line of authority originating with a representative
director.

* A certified copy of the seal register.

* A certified copy of the register of the company issued by the Legal
Affairs Bureau, to confirm the business purposes and the identity of the
representative director.

7.  Less Conservative Approach

Major Companies

For major Japanese trading companies, banks, insurance companies and other
companies of equivalent size, the following approach could be adopted which
would not be out of line with market practice:

* The application to be executed by a manager (or general manager)(bucho)
of the relevant department or above, or

* By a person able to establish a line of authority from such party.

A more aggressive approach would involve accepting applications signed by a
person at the level of section manager (kacho) or section chief (kakaricho),
but
this is right "on the line" and we would prefer Enron to do so only if there
is
some history of dealings with the company or other evidence to back up an
apparent authority argument.

Smaller Companies

For other companies the approach would be as set out in 6. above.

Perhaps your credit control procedures could be used to set a benchmark for
dividing between small and large companies.

8.  Likely Response of Target  Companies

Your marketing experts will be in a better position than us to form a view
but,
taking into account Japanese commercial practice, we do not believe any
company
is likely to be offended if Enron responds along the above lines to an
application signed by a person who does not meet the above suggested approach,
particularly taking into account that the approach is not inconsistent with
the
correspondence and application form the companies have been sent and no
applications have yet been approved.

Regards

Paul Davis/Hideo Ohta

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


The Senate voted on the Interior Appropriations Bill late yesterday.  Our
amendment passed, which prevents either BLM or the Forest Service from
enacting new fiber optic federal lands rights-of-way policies.  The BLM made
a last ditch effort to defeat this in the Senate, but we had reached key
Senators and staff and they got nowhere.
Action now moves to Conference, which for us means a focus on the House
Conference members.  Scott and I will spend the next 2 days meeting with the
key Republicans in the House.  We've already recruited the important
Democrats.  Interior Approps Subcommittee Chairman Regula remains opposed, at
least publicly, but we think we can get other Members to swing him.  We trust
he'll come up with a sensible, face saving compromise on his own, eg,
formally beginning a review process with his Subcommittee having oversight --
at this point, our language literally forbids BLM or Forest Service from even
meeting to discuss the issue.
We continue, though, on several other fronts:
1. We have the New Dems writing OMB on the issue and several Senators and
Congressmen writing BLM and USFS
2. We've increased the pressure on the White House, and are letting them know
through very senior back door channels that in our opinion, BLM/Forest
Service have not gotten the message.  Our position is that we'll be satisfied
that they've changed their evil ways when the new assessment on the Mt. Hood
EBS build is retracted.
3. We're preparing both Senate and House authorizing Committees for the
longer-term issue next session.  We have no trouble finding champtions eager
to own the issue
4. We're engaging the Western Caucus for same
5. Our adhoc coalition continues to grow in numbers and clout with over 20
companies and associations now actively engaged.  Enron chairs this
initiative, with a tangible side benefit being much increased visibility and
stature as a serious communications player.
6. Scott is successfully engaging state and local officials to weigh in from
the end-user perspective
BLM is on the retreat and has asked for a meeting, which we've refused.   We
don't think they've given up though, and it's likely an issue of pride at
this point.  So until the Approps process concludes we're continuing with the
full court press.

Matt-
I am unsure as to what Mike Dahlke is referencing when utilizing the term
"Business Model Patent".  If you believe it appropriate, perhaps you could
clarify this with him.
I note, that yesterday I was requested by Mike Grimes to join in on a
conference call that was in progress.  The question that Jae Moo had raised
was as to whether we could state to the Korean authorities that the Japanese
authorities had arrived at the conclusion that weather derivatives should be
categorized as a  commodity derivative, as opposed to a financial
derivative.  I informed the participants on the call that in Japan, weather
derivatives are considered financial in nature, most analagous under the
Japanese regulatory framework to FX and interest rate transactions. The basis
for this, is that there can be no physical delivery with a weather
derivative, as would be possible in a commodity type transaction, therefore
resulting in the classification of a financial derivative.
If I may be of further assistance, please contact me.  My office phone number
in Tokyo is 81-3 5219-4578.

It sounds like I need to clafify my plans for trading and risk management of
power in Ontario.

1.  Garrett is in Toronto and should be doing everything possible to try to
understand all the ins and outs of the Ontario Power Market including
building forward curves.  He has dual reporting to Paul Devries (head of the
Enron's Toronto operation) and Dana Davies (head of ENA power trading for the
Northeast U.S.).  Dana has ultimate risk management responsibility for
Ontario.

2.  My current opinion is that we should trade Ontario out of the Toronto
office with risk management responsibilities rolling into Dana.  This could
always change in the future if it doesn't make sense.

3.  John Mckay, although he has been helping Bill out, will ultimately have
no power trading responsibilities.

4.  Tom May is the cash trader in N.Y. reporting to Dana.  I expect us to use
Tom's expertise with respect to Ontario to build up our competency there,
however, Toms' main role will be N.Y.

5.  Garrett should spend some time (probably soon) in Houston getting to know
the people and the technical resources available to him.

If anyone has any questions concerns please give me a call.

John

Bob,

I wanted to continue the analysis on mark-to-market that I had spoken to you
about on the phone.

I thought that it was getting very difficult explaining the whole transaction
by
phone, so I am having Krishnarao who is in Vince's group explain the
transaction
to you.

Krishna has been helping us structure the deal here in India, and he has just
returned to Houston from India after working with the team here.

He will seek an appointment with you to explain the transaction.  I would like
you to please spend some time with him, and then based on the discussion
please
send us a note detailing how sucha a transaction would be marked to market.

Please cosider the fact that currently there are no such transactions from the
Indian side.  This is a very important transaction for us, and we may need to
repeat this in coming months, hence setting up the system to account for these
maybe well worth it.  Also, what I am concerned about is that there will be an
Enron India (EIPL) account in India based on Indian GAAP, and upon
consolidation
there will be a US GAAP accounting in the US.  It is here that we would like
to
have mark-to-market accounting.  EIPL is structured through Mauritius, and
then
Caymen Islands.

Another key question to consider is that when we m-t-m the transaction in the
US
there will be a tax accruing in the year of m-t-m (say 2000).  However, in
India, as a result of the accrual accounting, there will not be any income
showing till the year 2002 or 2003.  We will need to know how that would get
treated, and whether there is a way to get credit for the tax payable in the
US.
I am also confused about whether US tax would be levied, since none of the
income is being brought back into the US (remains overseas - subpart-F and
other
concerns).

Finally, we have been working hard in structuring a fixed price contract and
getting a fixed for floating swap in the US (this is still not allowed to
Indian
Corporates).  I need you to think about this too, and see if some type of
accounting will solve this issue.  Krishna knows what I am talking about, and
will brief you on the same.

Krishna - Please walk Bob through the three structures we had worked here.

Look forward to your help and comments.  This is going to be an exciting
project
for us all.

Regards,
Sandeep.

AA if you know of any other issues of completeness that I have not addressed,
please let Eugenio and I know!

*Why is Agg_ECT and Agg_ INDEX not available for January 1999?
*Is Cuiba in ESA's Nos.  Is it gas or power?  What month was it first
included? Is that the trade month?
*When did Australia first have substantial activity?  For some reason, the
spreadsheet has a June number, no July or August,      then September -
December.  If the first half of the year has material activity, we need to
get it from them.
*Has the Merrill peaker transaction been calculated yet (it was not
originally in theDPR)?  We definitely have to have that for the Dec. number.
*Where is EES gas?  Is it in the AGG_ECT?
*When did Kinneman's debt activity start?  The first VAR that we have is
September.  Did it start earlier?
*Did ET&S first have financial hedges in May, that is the first number that
we have?  Who should I talk to there?
*Is the June and September Rhythms number different that what we originally
calculated for the second and third quarter?  June must be as I recall it was
excluded at the time vs. the $24MM now showing.  Are the differences
primarily due to the 100%+ volatility versus the 60%+ number that Stinson
originally gave you? Have you asked him why he gave you what he did?  Please
get Jill Erwin to help you revise the December number for Ghost.
*There is lots of missing numbers for Total Return Swaps.  Eugenio and Gail
Tholen to determine which swaps were in place in which months of 1999 and run
the appropriate models.  If different models will need to be used in
different periods of the year for the same swap, lets get that information
out to AA and Jan.

Great!  We've got a meeting set for 9 am on Wed on the regulatory structure
of the pipeline.  Also, I talked to Kevin and Tim separately today on the
market research issue.  I think Tim could probably identify the specific
electric rate PNM charges DOE at Sandia and DOD at Kirtland as well as the
general tariff rate for large industrial service.  If we are lucky, there
might be some info in PNM's last rate case on the discounted electric rates
it gives specific large industrials (if any).  Obviously, any info on gas or
elec. loads and rates would be useful.  Kevin, I told Tim you'd give him a
call to convey further thoughts, but this is probably enough to get Tim
started.
I got a call this afternoon from Tino.  He asked our help on right of way
issues with BNSF.  Could Steve, Kevin or Lorraine take point on trying to
find out if we or anyone within Enron has a good contact at BNSF that we
could use?  Lets keep all such external contacts very discreet to avoid
tipping PNM that Enron is involved.  Just in general on the confidentiality
issue, Tim reminded me of an important date we all need to keep in mind--the
current leglislative session in Santa Fe ends Feb. 17.  We need to be
absolutely sure that we don't tip PNM off that we are talking to Langley
before then so we don't get them interested in the leglislative fix we are
supporting on the Plains-Tri State merger.  Tim believes PNM could spike that
leglislative fix in a heartbeat if they wanted to.  That issue is real
immediate dollars, so lets not let a future deal screw up a present deal
(even a lawyer like me can figure out the cost benefit on that situation).
Tino had a new fact to work into the economics:  DOE has 6000MMBtu/d of pure
gas load at Sandia in addition to elec. load.  No number yet on Kirtland gas
load.  Also, Tino has heard that a guy named Jeff Sturba will likely replace
Montoya at PNM before the end of the year.  Has anyone else heard that?  Do
we know him?
I told Tino that one of us would give him a call back by the end of the week
just to report in on our analysis.  At minimum, we can probably pass on the
name of a contact at Enron Wind for Tino to bother on the windmill thing.
Turned out that the wind pilot project is on the Rosebud reservation in S.D.
and has nothing to do with the Albuquerque project anyway.  Sorry about the
random message but thats how my brain is working today.  DF

Rick,

Not wishing to delay the comprehensive review of our trading support
function, particularly as it relates to our Global Products business, we
already have Barry Pearce taking a lead in this area.

The issue of concern is whether this should be an interim measure or a more
permanent solution.  Well - nothing is permanent in Enron and I think Barry
understands this as well as anybody. If we had a more suitable candidate, we
would give him/her the job.

I have seen Barry develop and mature over the last 12 months along with the
team that we have built around him. I'm convinced that he can add significant
value by drawing the Global Products support functions 'in to the fold'.
However, he clearly has a credibility issue with Ted in particular and,
whilst I do not share Ted's views, I do not hold Barry out as a saint and I
can see recurring problems if such a key relationship is not well grounded.

I suggest that we continue to search for a candidate - known and trusted
within Houston, who can instill confidence there. Steve Young (head of RAC in
London) may be an interesting option, although I'm sure he would not be easy
to replace. In the meantime we need Barry to take things forward and I will
be monitoring the situation very closely.

Regards

Fernley.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


In a frank discussion with Barry I had to advise him that it will be very
difficult for him to succeed in the role I proposed for him (and indeed in
his current role in the medium term). He is standing in the cross-hairs of a
rifle sight - one move and he's dead.

I have no doubt that we will find a role for this talented individual which
will enable him to sustain the tremendous level of contribution that we are
used to seeing from him.

Of course it will mean that progress in developing our trading support
operations will be slower than it otherwise would have been. I shall be
looking for a suitable candidate to fill the co-ordination role - as you
know, individuals of the necessary calibre and experience are rare.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Matt:

Thanks for the quick turnaround.

I have only a few comments to the draft request for advice to Kim & Chang:

1) I think you should clarify that the servers for EOL are located and
maintained outside Korea.

2) I think you should mention that in other jurisdictions we have reviewed
(e.g., US, Australia) for the legality of weather derivatives, counsel has
advised us that the instruments are not likely to be treated as insurance
contracts.  This is primarily because the payout is not linked to a casualty
event as would be the case in an insurance contract.  David Minns may have
additional language to add here.

3) Under Weather Derivatives, delete "Osaka" and replace with "Australia".

4) Just a point of clarification, but as currently envisioned by the Korean
commercial team (e.g., Chris Hunt, Jae-Moo and Michelle Lee) when we met with
them here in Houston earlier this week, financial derivatives (e.g., interest
rate, f/x) would not be traded online with Korean counterparties. Basically,
any financial derivatives that would be traded would involve personnel likely
located in Japan entering into via phone (e.g., conventional means) an
interest rate hedge or f/x hedge with a Korean financial counterparty in
order to facilitate the management of the risks carried in Enron Corp.'s
global financial risk book in Houston. This would just be an extension of the
services that would be performed by Enron Japan on behalf of Enron.
Accordingly, I think we need to delete the "On-Line Financial Derivatives"
portion of the draft request b/c I think the analysis captured in the earlier
memos from Kim & Chang generally addresses this type of derivative activity.
If you think otherwise, please adjust the request appropriately.

4) As to ECTRIC's GTCs, I think you should just attach the collateral version
for now.

Susan : Do you have any comments to add to the request for advice from a tax
perspective?

I have also copied David Minns on this note to keep him apprised of this
request b/c of the Weather Derivatives piece.

Matt, assuming you receive no further comments internally, I think you should
go ahead and finalize the request and e-mail to Kim & Chang for their review
by the end of this week.

Regards, Alan

1. I am still waiting to hear whether ENA needs any special authority to
enter into a debt transaction of this nature.

2. I  have discussed the guaranty with Bank One's Internal counsel (Bob
Long), and enclose a revised draft below, to address a number of his
concerns. Please let me know any thoughts that you have prior to my
distributing this to him.



3. I have reviewed the note and accompanying documentation provided by Bank
One, and note the following:
i) The side letter authorises BOBIC to act as ENA's attorney in fact to
initiate borrowings under the margin line.
ii) The Customer Agreement in Paragraph 6 provides for interest on a debit
balance--it is not clear how this fits with the other documentation.
iii) The remedies provision of the Customer Agreement (Paragraph 5) allows
for liquidation in the event a bankruptcy petition is filed against ENA--it
is customary in finance deals to have a 60 day window to have actions filed
by third parties dismissed or stayed.
iv) The note duplicates the interest calculation provision in the side
letter, however, it omits fixed rate option set out in (c) of the side letter.
v) The note refers to a "deposit account". Is there one? Or rather is it a
different type of account?
vi) The note allows for notice by telex. [I believe that the Telex system is
for all intents, defunct]
vii) Bank One is allowed to disclose confidential information to 'purchasers
or prospective purchasers"--these could be competitors.This provision is
different from that contained in Section 19 of the Customer Agreement.



Please let me know your thoughts prior to my sending these comments to Bob
Long.

give him a head count within the next few days.  For now, he's got us
penciled in for about 10 tee times beginning at 8:32 a.m.  (I'll be playing
in that first foursome since it's most important that I get to the church
before any of you knuckleheads).  The cost will be $44.00 (green fee and 1/2

Hi Dale

Following discussions with Vince, Grant and Stinson, we've drawn up the
proposed budget.  We're working on the basis that Research Group headcount
will grow to 8 in the near future.

Business trips US: 8
Business trips Europe: 10

Computer software and licences: GBP 10,000
Office postage: GBP 350
Employee recruitment fees: GBP 30,000 ( = 3 x 20% x GBP 50,000)
Professional subscriptions and memberships AND books: GBP 15,000
Training courses: GBP 16,000 ( = 8 x GBP 2,000)
Conferences: GBP 8,000 ( = 4 x GBP 2,000)
Mobile phones: GBP 1,500 ( = 3 x GBP 500 = me + 2 floaters)
Hardware: GBP 10,000 ( = laptops, workstations)

Suggested allocation as follows...
RAC 20%
UK Power 20%
UK Gas 5%
Continental Power 20%
Continental Gas 5%
Global products 10%
EBS 10%
EES 10%
...unless you've got any other views on this one (I'm happy to take advice
here).

Vince has said you can give him a call if you want to discuss any of these
points further, but I'm happy to field initial queries (I'll have to get used
to it!).

Cheers,
Steve

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Today was the final ENA PRC.  Relative ranking results up through the Senior
Director level are final.  You and your management team can begin the process
of giving performance reviews to your employees.  I spoke with Sheila Walton
today to inquire about an expected time frame for completing and conducting
the employee reviews.  She indicated that the target completion date should
be the end of July.

Promotions will be effective August 1st.  It is Dave Delainey's intent to
announce ENA promotions sometime after he returns from vacation on July 24.
This drives the end of July target completion date for reviews.   I do not
yet know if Delainey wants all ENA promotions to be announced in a single
memo, or if each group within ENA will prepare such a memo.  I will keep you
updated on this as I get direction from him.

Please note the following change since our Energy Operations PRC in June.  In
order to place focus on the qualitative feedback during this mid-year review
process, we will not share performance clusters with employees when
conducting their reviews.   It is very important for all of us to be
consistent in this process, so please communicate this to all in your groups
who will be giving performance reviews.  It is important to note, however,
that the content of an employee's review should be consistent with our view
of that employee's relative ranking.  In other words, an employee in the
Satisfactory category should not be given a review that simply states that
the employee is doing a great job.   Clearly, a large number of employees
performed at a higher level than those employees in the Satisfactory
category, so the feedback to that employee should include some specific areas
of improvement needed in order for the employee to make a stronger impact in
the organization, help you achieve the groups goals, etc.

Also please note the following:

Performance reviews for anyone in the Satisfactory, Needs Improvement or
Issues categories must be reviewed by HR prior to these reviews being given
to the employees.  This will ensure that our feedback is commensurate with
the relative performance of that employee.  (This has been the stated process
for the bottom two categories, and we are adding Satisfactory to this process
as well.)
Please remember to include a more experienced member of your management team,
yourself, or an HR professional in reviews being conducted by inexperienced
members of your management team, or those management team members where you
have a concern over their ability or willingness to deliver candid and
perhaps tough performance feedback.  I believe that we have spent some time
in identifying these situations.  I ask your help to ensure that we follow
through on this commitment.

Thanks for all of your efforts in making this mid-year PRC process a
meaningful one.






It is Dave Delainey's intent to announce It if 0

_____________________ HammerHeads and Friends,

This is your monthly reminder for our social get-together. We've been having
great turn-outs recently, so we're sticking with what works. (We're the
fastest growing dive club in Houston!)

Same Place: Surfer's Paradise (located in the Marq E shopping mall just
north of I10 at Silber near the Edward's IMAX theater). Ask for the
HammerHeads group in the party room.
Same Day: Last Thursday of the month - August 31
Same Time: 7:30 - 9:30 pm (About 10 minutes of announcements at 8:00)

I'm sorry I'll miss you all this month. I'll be in California starting the
Labor Day weekend a little early. (I've attached some of the updates at the
end of this note.) Have a great holiday - Hope you get to spend it
underwater!

HammerHeads Updates
The Bylaws Committee is still working hard to put together the club rules.
In the meantime, temporary officers have been elected:
Kristi Foster - King Crab (President)
Kenny Vassigh - Alternate Air Source (VP)
Cathie Borreson - Second Stage (VP)
Kim Frederick - Filefish (Secretary)

Dive Trips, Local Dives, Environmental Awareness, Sponsorships, Non-Diving
Events, Public Relations, Other Club Events, HammerHeads Interactions,
Communications and Fundraising.
We're still looking for several chairpeople and we definitely need lots of
committee members. Ask any one of the officers for more info. We'll try to
publish details soon.

Upcoming Events:
Labor Day Weekend:- OJ Strickland is going to Athens Scuba Park. Let him
know if you're interested
Sept 28 - Oct 5: Kristi Foster and Wendy McSwain are taking a big group to
Cayman Madness
Oct 7 - Trashfest. Contact Cathie Borresen or Kenny Vassigh.

Shona, Brent and Sally,
This morning, the cash flows from approximately 75 books were not received by
Infinity from the ERMS system.  We normally get 375 books and only got 296
this morning.

Per conversation with Joyce Kuo and Mike Moscoso, Susan Trevino, Risk
Controls,  and Christian, RAC, changed the book heirarchy on Friday, moving
global products books, including the prepays, out of the ECT group and into
another group.  We have had discussions in the past verifying with Risk
Controls that the ECT group is the only group which automatically sends its
cash flows to Infinity.  Other cash flows from books are included only by
being listed in a script.  This was not done when the books were moved from
the ECT Group on Friday.

Obviously, the Rate & Currency is not able to hedge Enron's cash flows when
so much has been omitted.   At this time we are about one hour away from a
good Hedging report for the trading desk.  This report is due the desk daily
by 7:30 am.

Mike and I discussed the need for controls and sign-off by him or Shona for
changes in book heirarchy.
Sheila

Sara,
When can we get a revised draft (credit issue outstanding) for the spark
spread confirmation; should not take very long to revise the terms and
conditions.
Brad and Chris will be in San Francisco meeting with the developers and GE
tomorrow.  I ran into Randy and he suggested we should meet with him early
next week to discuss the current deal structure.  I think we should be able
to resolve the credit issue and any other remaining issues with this document
at that time (if any remain) and we will want to send this document out
immeadiately thereafter.  Therefore, I suggest that we should clean up the
general terms and conditions in preparation of this so that we are in a
position to send this document out ASAP once any remaining issues are
resolved.
Many thanks for your cooperation in this matter.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Almost one month ago, Special Agent Carl Wake of the FBI called me about the
Steve Todoroff investigation.  He indicated that the FBI had recently learned
of the article about EOTT's NGL theft that appeared in the business section
of the Houston Chronicle.  Mr. Wake said it might be a matter the FBI would
like to investigate.  I told Mr. Wake that EOTT was currently working with
the Harris County District Attorney on the prosecution of this matter, and I
thanked him for the FBI's interest.  He told me that the FBI might want to
work with the Harris County District Attorney in investigating this matter,
and he stated that there may be investigative information that the FBI can
obtain more quickly than the Harris County District Attorney.  Mr. Wake
requested a copy of the materials we had provided to the Harris County
District Attorney.

In order to avoid damage to the good rapport we have established with
Assistant District Attorney Bill Moore, I asked John DeGeeter to call Bill
Moore and advise him of the contact that had been made by the FBI.  Bill
Moore agreed to call Carl Wake and work with Mr. Wake on his request for the
materials provided by EOTT.

Carl Wake called me again yesterday.  He has been working with Bill Moore.
Mr. Wake stated it was too early to speculate as to what charges would be
brought.  He did say that our materials clearly indicated federal wire fraud
and possibly mail fraud.  He said that where there is wire fraud, there is
usually money laundering.

The purpose of Mr. Wake's call yesterday was to inquire about the status of
some interview summaries that John DeGeeter and I have prepared and collected
at the request of Bill Moore.  Mr. Wake requested that EOTT send a copy of
the summaries to him when we sent the summaries to Bill Moore.  Those
summaries were sent out today.

I gathered from my calls with Carl Wake that the FBI is very interested in
taking an active part in this investigation.  In order to build on the
relationship we have established with Bill Moore, we will continue to direct
our inquires about the investigation to Mr. Moore until he tells us to do
otherwise.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Mike,  I reveiwed the proposal by Adewumi and it is correct and fairly
accurate, for the purposes of a historic account and and in as far as  what
was provided to him in the way of data and history.  His proposed scope seems
to be conclusive and appears to be what we need.   I have included Louie in
the distribution  and am sure he will have some input.

My comments are as follows:

1.  I dont know how relevant it is to know about the customers facilities at
this time.  As you know, we have more than one customer (PG&E and SoCal), and
I  think that we should maintain a low profile especially with respect ot
SoCal.  Both parties in the past,  have been helpful and very cooperative in
matters  pertaining to PCB's. Because the modeling study will be conducted
between C/S 3 and C/S 2, the customers facilities should have no impact on
this.

2.  Also, I would like to see if we can deal with  PCB's and arsenic at the
same time?  Is it possible to simultanously model both contaminants?

3. Because the modeling efforts are conducted on a very small portion of the
pipeline, can this section be used for all of the Transwestern system?  In
leau of  the fact that we have pipe under rivers, over rivers, major
elevation chages in short distances etc which are not covered in the section
to be modeled, will  the pipeline characteristics be covered to the extent
that it will yeild information applicable to the entire pipeline system?

4. I am also concerned about stirring up the PCB's and moving additional
PCB's into the SoCal system.  Its been pretty quiet  in discussions with the
SoCal  PCB person.  I wonder if we should notify Ralph Komai to be on the
alert when we start the cleaning?  Louie, thoughts?

5. Injection of terpenol into the station yard piping.  How will we do this
and how do we get it out?

6. Impact of terpenol on gaskets, engine parts, etc.

By , Inter@ctive Week
November 19, 1999 7:12 AM PT




This week's Webcast tied to ABC's "The Drew Carey Show" drew 1.9 million
viewers,
making it one of the largest Webcast events in Web history.

But anointing the Nov. 17 Webcast as the single largest multimedia event
online depends
mostly on how you do the counting.

The Web video -- produced by "Drew Carey" creator Bruce Helford and Warner
Bros.
Television and intended to be watched simultaneously with the on-air
broadcast of
Wednesday's "Drew Carey Show" episode -- was able to stagger its viewership
over three
separate airings of the television show in the Eastern, Mountain and Western
time zones of
the United States.

Consequently, it's difficult to make comparisons with previous Webcast
events. Online
broadcasts, such as February's online lingerie fashion show by Victoria's
Secret and
Broadcast.com that drew an estimated 1.4 million visitors, typically have
been one-shot live
events drawing all of their traffic during a single showing of the Webcast.

Figures detailing peak online viewership levels are not yet available. Warner
Bros. cobbled
together a network of online multimedia distribution companies to handle the
Nov. 17
Webcast's traffic, making it difficult to compile detailed viewership data
quickly, said Jim
Banister, executive vice president of Warner Bros. Online.

Warner Bros. contracted with a string of companies -- including Akamai
Technologies,
Enron, e-Media, Globex, iBeam Broadcasting, InterVU and Sandpiper Networks --
to carry
the Webcast feed. Because of the scattered nature of the distribution system,
it is hard to
tell how many users were blocked from accessing the video feed or to
determine how long
viewers stayed tuned in to the Webcast, Banister said.

Still, Warner Bros. officials are heartened by the early results and are
planning additional
online streaming events, including an online promotion for rock band
Metallica slated for
later this month.

"We are going to see exponential growth in the ability to do Web streaming
events,"
Banister said. "It's only going to get better and better and more refined."


11/19/1999 Daily Variety Page 6 Copyright 1999 Variety, Inc.




The first streaming Webisode of ABC laffer "The Drew Carey Show" from Warner
Bros. Online attracted nearly 2 million visits, capturing more viewers online
Wednesday night than most cable programming.


Warner Bros. Online also said Thursday it has inked a pact with actor Chris
O'Donnell to begin producing original content for its upcoming entertainment
hub Entertaindom, sometime in the next year.


While watching "Carey's" regularly scheduled TV show on ABC, Netizens also
used Microsoft's Windows Media Player to watch what happens inside Carey's
house when he's at work, including Ed McMahon failing to find Carey to hand
him a $1 million check, and dogs and ghosts throwing a bash inside the house.


Warner Bros. is using the Webcast to tease its new online streaming video
venture Entertaindom, which officially bows Nov. 29. Its event slate includes
a weeklong Netcast of the new Metallica album.


The "Drew Cam" sweeps event was exec-produced by Bruce Helford and produced
by Warner Bros. Online in association with Warner Bros. Television and
ABC.com.


Tech partners for the event included Akamai Technologies, Don Mischer
Technologies, E-Media, Enron Communications, Globix, Ibeam, InterVu,
SandPiper-Digital Island and Sonic Foundry Media Services.


"This is a television-Internet first," Warner Bros. Online exec VP Jim
Banister said. "Not only was the program entertaining and evolutionary in its
cross-media creative expression, it also gave birth to a new paradigm in how
to reach large audiences via streaming media."


Ratings for "Drew Cam" may have topped the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show and
MTV's NetAid events, which so far rank as the most watched video broadcasts
online.


Warner Bros. Online also said Thursday that O'Donnell has handed over
management of his Web fan sites to Warner Bros. home page community AcmeCity,
the latest example of an actor attempting to protect his image on the 'Net.


O'Donnell has 57,000 fansites on Yahoo! GeoCities, alone.


Warner Bros. will also help steer the official Web presence of O'Donnell's
George Street Pictures, which produced "The Bachelor" and the upcoming CBS
telepic "Miracle on the 17th Green."


O'Donnell said he will produce yet-to-be-determined programming for
Entertaindom in the coming year.


"I want to begin building a core audience of Internet-based fans today
because producing entertainment programming (online) will mean a lot more
than making movies in the future," O'Donnell said.

Wade,  Thanks for bringing this issue to our attention. But I need help
understanding this one.  We have a process already to handle John's behind
the citygate deals

Since, the actual scheduling is done by CES in Virginia,  we never nominate
this gas nor do we see actuals.  We hear about them from John and Terry and
we are supposed to get confirms from the producer and CES.  Whenever one of
these deals occurs, we have buys from the producer and sales to CES to
account for these transactions internally.

It's my understanding that whenever John cuts one of these behind the
citygate deals;  that Terry puts it into Sitara for him.  The offset also
entered by Terry  is a sale to CES (Now the New Power Company effective Sept.
1) with commercial (usually Chris Germany) confirming the sale price.  Angie
schedules it in Unify under CNG and we create, track and balance like usual.

Is that not the case here?  Is this something that's getting reconciled in
Jeanne and Terry's project for CNG???

By cc: Angie, please get with Terry /Jeanne and Chris to help Wade.  THANKS!
Please keep me abreast of the status.

Cathy Van Way called asking my view on some names she'd been given to invite
to the hearing.  (I continue to cajole Jessie Knight to appear.)  During the
call, she mentioned that the committee intends to invite Steve Kean and that
she needed someone to email here Steve's vitals so that they could write a
letter inviting him.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Howdy everybody,

I've cut and pasted in below a piece that should be published in the Turkish
Daily News (the English language paper here) later this week.  It's a first
person piece about my experience of a Christmas service here last year, a
lot of which you'll recognize from last year.  (Ugh, I'm already repeating
myself and I've just started [though really had no choice, as needed to get
it out before the holiday itself].)  Since this year Christmas again fell
during the Muslim Holy Month of Ramadan, the piece is sort of year neutral.

Happy holidays,

Mark-O

Christmas Day, Istanbul


The priest mutters his deeply accented English into the microphone,
which amplifies and further distorts his voice.  His bluntly pronounced
words rebound through the vast, freezing hall of Saint Antoine Cathedral.
They tell a story familiar to me, about the Son of God being sent to earth
to die for our sins.  But here, in the middle of this enormous Muslim City,
the story sounds strange and almost subversive.
And, indeed, the Christ story is at the center of the great Christian
and Muslim divide.  Muslims accept only that Christ was a prophet sent by
God, rejecting vehemently that Christ is his son.  They see Mohammed's
prophecy, and the Koran, as prompted by the need to correct the mistaken
elevation -- by the Gospel -- of Christ from the flesh to the divine.
The priest appears relieved to turn things over to an African man who,
in a bizarre contrast to the priest?s gold embroidered robe, is wearing a
big, stuffed yellow ski jacket.  His English is much better as he announces
that we are now to sing a hymn.  The song?s words, handwritten and in
English, are flashed up onto a screen by an overhead projector.  The lyrics
are basic.  There are several identical stanzas that simply invite Jesus ?to
come?.  I grimace slightly when I see that these are followed by a poorly
translated chorus, which asks for the Son of God "to come will be born in
our heart?.
I glance over at Ismail, a Muslim friend who has come with me to the
service.  He smiles, gives me a wink.  His English is excellent and I am
sure he notices the mistake.  I look around at the rest of the people in the
sanctuary.  The pews are not even a third full.  This is the first service
of the day, and is completely in English.  It will be followed by an Italian
and a Turkish one.  The crowd at the Turkish service, Ismail tells me, will
overflow into the courtyard in front of the Cathedral, and will consist
mostly of Muslims curious to see a Christmas service.  Apparently some
members of St. Antoine's permanent congregation are angry about this, since
many of them will be unable to find a place to sit.  Some may even being
forced to stand out in the cold.


Christmas Day, this year, falls within the Muslim holy Month of
Ramadan, during which the faithful are to fast between sunrise and sunset,
or more precisely -- according to the Koran -- between the times one can
discern a white thread from a black one.  (Ramadan is celebrated during the
ninth month of the Muslim calendar, which is a lunar one; in the solar
calendar it occurs 11 days earlier each year.)  My day had started well
before dawn when I was awoken by our neighborhood's Ramadan drummer, who was
roaming the streets pounding his drum and hollering at the top of his lungs.
Since Ramadan began several days ago, all over Istanbul similar drummers
have been setting out into the streets, some as early as 3 a.m.  A tradition
originating from a time when clocks were less prevalent, their aim is to
rustle the believers up out of bed in time for them to have a meal before
the sun comes up.
Ramadan is by far the most important religious observance of the year
for Muslims.  Somewhat like the Jewish celebration of Yom Kippur, which some
say influenced it, Ramadan is a period of atonement and forgiveness.  Total
remission of sins can be achieved if one fasts with pure intentions.  I have
been told that in Turkey, which is 98% Muslim, well over 50% of all the
Turks fast during Ramadan.  That estimate is certainly consistent with what
I have seen and heard.  The majority of the Turks I come in contact tell me
they fast.  The streets of Istanbul are normally full of vendors selling all
sorts of food.  There are noticeably fewer of them now and they are
significantly less busy.  During the day some restaurants are closed, many
of the rest all but empty.  I myself have been careful to be respectful and
eat only indoors, avoiding among other things my usual practice of grabbing
a simit (a bagel like round of bread) and piece of fruit in the morning and
eating them on my way to work.


Ismail leans over and asks if the service is similar to ones in the
States.  I whisper back that I was raised Protestant and had not seen enough
Catholic services in my life to say.  ?Raised? Protestant was really much
too strong a word to use.  My early religious education involved little more
than an hour each Sunday down in the basement of the local Presbyterian
Church (first in Westfield, New Jersey, later in Aurora, Illinois) with my
twin sister Sue.  There, during our Sunday school class, we often struggle
for the entire hour to suppress giggling fits to which we only seemed
susceptible in church.  Sitting now in St. Antoine?s, I check myself to see
if any of those fits still linger, am relieved to discover that none do.
The priest has returned and is now saying something about light being
shown into the darkness, and about how the darkness was unable to defeat
that light.  The image of a light, tiny but robust, surrounded by infinite
darkness, is a particularly powerful one for me today, especially given that
I am so far from what I am most familiar.
A new voice -- the priest had been replaced again -- asks us to rise.
The words of ?Come Let Us Adore Him? are projected onto the screen.  I lean
over toward Ismail, whisper that this is a very famous song.  He kids under
his breath that perhaps it?s one of God?s greatest hits.  I smile,
straighten back up, listen to the song begin.
There is no choir, only a single guitar for accompaniment.  It takes a
while for the congregation?s singing to build up.  Though it never becomes
particularly loud, it is beautiful.  Eventually I join in too.  As if
something ethereal, our voices drift up through the tremendous space that
envelops us, seeming only to just barely penetrate the thick, cold air.  I
am moved by how wonderful our singing sounds and am surprised to feel a
tear, though already ice-cold, in the corner of my eye.  Most of the people
here are Westerners, I suppose, and I wonder how many came like me to be
reminded of home -- a few cold foreigners dwarfed by a Cathedral that is
itself dwarfed by the immense Moslem city surrounding it.  For the first
time since arriving in Istanbul, I feel a bit homesick.
The song ends.  The priest returns, invites everyone up to take
communion. Thinking that Ismail might find it interesting, I suggest that we
walk to the front of the church to watch.  We do.  But when we get there I
am surprised that our way is blocked by a dozen or so television cameramen,
who have begun filming the ceremony.  I had not seen them before and wonder
where they might have been hiding.
Some, now with the powerful lights attached to their cameras turned on,
swing around and start filming those who have remained in the pews.  An
older woman, who is kneeling and praying, is caught in one of those lights.
The cameraman moves in closer and is soon no more than a couple feet away.
With her eyes closed, the elderly woman continues her praying.  I wonder how
she can concentrate and, indeed, if she can.  But she continues, or at least
pretends to, perhaps seeing it as an act of defiance.
The cameramen get even bolder and are now moving freely about the
church, filming others at point blank range.  Ismail says he does not want
to be on the evening news and tells me he will meet me outside.  I return to
my seat and watch the end of communion, wrapped up like it is, so
incongruously, in the hectic filming.  And I wonder how God would view all
this, his two most successful religions bumping up against each other in
such an awkward fashion.  Which of the many ways these two religions have
come up with to worship him would he approve of, disapprove?


This afternoon, in Istanbul, the few Christians families that live here
will be feasting and celebrating with their families and friends, perhaps
exchanging gifts.  Early in the evening, after the blast of the cannon shots
heard all over Istanbul that signal the end of the day's Ramadan fasting,
pious Muslims will sit down to their own post-fast celebratory meal, the
Iftar.  Later still, the mosques will be filled, though mostly by men, where
special Ramadan prayers will be said.  Istanbul itself is remarkable -- at
least to westerners -- for the many domes of its huge Ottoman mosques and
the hundreds of minarets that spike its skyline, as well as the calls to
prayer that pierce its urban din five times each day.
Yet when the day ends, throughout Istanbul, each of us will fall asleep
under the same black sky.

"In him was life; and the life was the light of men.
And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not." *

* Translation from the Bible.

"Praise be to God, Lord of the worlds!
The compassionate, the merciful!
King on the day of reckoning!
Thee only do we worship, and to Thee do we cry for help.
Guide Thou us on the straight path,
The path of those to whom Thou hast been gracious; -- with whom Thou are not
angry, and who go not astray." **

** Translation from the Koran.

I will need the same to prepare the agenda and have the team prepare for the
meeting.

Ranabir/Rahul,

Mohan will be the lead on the finance side on the mega status, and my team is
already involving him in our discussions.  Would you like to have him prepare
a small list of finance issues ?

Sandeep (Katwala),

Please let me know of key things on the legal side for discussion.  You can
update the group on the CERC forming Act.  Please jot me a small note on the
legal  issues list when you get the message.

Also, I need to know who is likely to be on the ground from the regulatory
side.

Terry & Steven - Are you both going to be in town ?

Regards,

Have been in Antakya for the last couple days.  Will leave tomorrow.  Might
spend a night in Iskenderun on the coast, or might head back to Istanbul via
Ankara (where I hope to spend a day) by train.

Antakya formally named Antioch, of great import to Christian history.  (If
you look on  a map, I'm in the that finger of land that extends down from
Turkey between Syria and the Mediterranean.)  Not much in the town of great
beauty; mostly just modern, cement based, instantly aged, utilitarian styled
buildings.  Things stitched together, rickety, somewhat polluted.  The town,
however, surrounded by impressive mountains.  Have met a young Arab man, who
has shown me around (saw some spectacular thousand year old ruins (build by
Christians; destroyed by Muslims) on top of a mountain not far from here,
from which vantage point we could look out over the Mediterranean (and a
setting sun) and also to the south at a snow capped mountain that stood
between us and nearby Syria).  Last night joined him and his friends.  We
ate this heavenly kebab wrapped in thin, fried (in olive oil) unleaven bread
(the whole thing called Durum), then I watched as they played a card game
akin to Bridge.  (Did you know that Bridge was invented in Istanbul some 150
years ago by a few British soldiers stationed there during the Crimean War?
The name came from the fact they crossed the Galata Bridge [not far from my
place] each evening.  [Florence Nightingale (sp?) also stationed in Istanbul
during that same war, which was when she made her name.]) Two of the players
were Christian, one was Turk and the fourth my "new" Arab friend.  This
provence, Hatay, is apparently the most diverse one here in Turkey, in an
ethnic, cultural, religious sense.

Boat ride over from Cyprus an ordeal.  Seas rough.  Took twice as long (4
hours instead of 2) as advertized.  I got worried when the stewards passed
out small plastic bags as we left port.  I lasted about an hour and a half
before I used mine, but was part of a vast majority of fellow suffers.  I
guess I didn't inherent sea legs for my old man.

More later,

Love,

Mark

A man and a woman meet at bar one day and are getting along really
well. They decide to go back to the woman's house where they engage in
passionate love making.

The woman suddenly cocks her ear and says, "quick my husbandjust got
home, go hide in the bathroom!" So the man runs into the bathroom.

Her husband comes up into the bedroom and looks at her. "Why are you
naked?" he asks.

Well, I heard you pull up outside, so I thought I would come up here
and get ready to recieve you."

"Okay." the man replies "I'll go get ready."

He goes into the bathroom before his wife can stop him and sees a
naked man standing there clapping his hands.

"Who the fuck are you?" the man asks

"I am from the exterminator company, your wife called me in to get rid
of the moths you are having problems with."

The husband exclaims, "But you are naked!"

The man then looks down and jumps back in surprise.

"Those little bastards!"

1. Top 20 List

The attached file is the final work plan for the initial analysis of Enron's

people to start this process.

I really appreciate everyone's help.  Call me if these assignments don't make
any sense.




2. Risk Event Catalog

Amr Ibrahim continues to develop the event catalog.  Please feel free to call
and work with him as much as you see fit.  I am hoping that we see a first
cut within a few months.

3. Regulatory Origination

Edith Terry made a good point related to our role in helping identify
positive regulatory and political changes (in the near-term) that can
increase our business value.  Everyone should constantly be on the look-out
for opportunties to further Enron's business interest.

4. Early Warning System

Robert Johnston is taking the lead on setting up a process / system to help
us understand the overall "environment" within countries that we have
business interests.  Anyone who wants to help should contact him.

Thanks again for all of the help.

Sounds reasonable to me.  When do we sign?  Seriously, this just confirms in

because he doesn't have any capital or O & M numbers (or heat rates) on the

on this project.  Once we are able to show him some economics he will

i must relate what happened last week, as it continues to be a ginormous

George Clinton P-Funk tickets were inside along with the supposedly great
Kafka book i had been reading.  can you say ouch?  believe y'all me, my
utterings were of a more expletive type, and the next few days were filled
with more Homer headslaps (doh!) and chinese communist-style written self-
criticisms than i care to remember.  but then it turned up at the Lost and
Found with everything accounted for, and the staff even apologized for
having thrown out the rice and veggie box lunch i had prepared.  silly
buggers even cleaned the tupperware!  there are times when one truly has to
hand it to the nipponese- that kind of thing is very much the standard and
it is a wonder to behold.



and George....as the funky man himself said, free your mind and your ass
will follow!   run, don't walk, to see the P-Funk.



have been meaning to give y'all a holler for a while now but as Scarface
would say i have had my head up my culo.   mea culpa and apologies
(especially to susan and doug, peerless purveyors of holiday cheer).  would
even submit to a spanking but only from the foxy sisters-in-law, provided
they abstained from the type of buttock-missing belt-wielding corporal
antics by which our Great She- Elephant used to brutalize our upper thighs
and lower backs.



all is well here and this boy's life has even gotten a wee saucy as of late
due to the attentions of one Xiao Zhou, a chinese woman with whom i spend
time on occasion.  she has an X and a Zed in her name - how cool is that!?
she can scrounge up some mean dumplings and dotes on me something fierce,
both of which help with the rationalizations employed during the two hour
train trips to Kyoto to see her.



she does not know miss shoe, in case anyone wondered, but she has eaten
chicken brain.



the trip on down to Yakushima proved to be a much needed and wholly positive
one in many ways.  the island is as lovely as one would expect of a World
Heritage Site, and i have never seen a rain forest give way to snowy
mountains exceeding treeline.  just bizarre juxtapositions to behold, like
mossy rocks in a snowfield.  and huge gnarled cedar trees that are older
than the J man and even Buddha.



four days of hiking up and over the main peak saw heaps of rain and snow
every day, with bouts of sunshine mixed in, and y'all can imagine my
shorts-wearing self did not dally too long at any point along the trail,
which on the ridge was knee-deep in snow.  just outstanding scenery and i
had almost forgotten my conviction that hikers are probably the most
generous, pleasant group of folks anywhere.    but one must be wary of the
nipponese when it comes to the traditional snack sharing, lest one be forced
by protocol to choke down the smoked squid eggs and dried clams fried in
seaweed foisted upon one as i was.



probably the highlight of this trip was the pair of hot springs i visited
after descending that cold ass mountain.  the first of these consisted of
three natural pools formed in the rock shore and only available when the
tide goes out, most of the time being submerged.  hit these on an
exceptionally starry night and it was something else.  the other was on
kyushu and may not qualify as a hot spring as there was no water involved,
only a sand bath.  it was pretty freaky to get buried under a foot of hot
sand by old ladies with shovels, but well worth it.  i always used to make
fun of the nipponese propensity to take holidays to hot spring resorts, but
now i understand.  they can really do you right.



that was about it for the trip - seven days and eight ferry rides.  oh yeah
- went to Chiran, the staging base for most of the Okinawa campaign
kamikazes, aka Floating Chrysanthemums.  they have a museum chock full of
last pictures and last letters home to families and loved ones.  pretty
powerful museum, that was.



on a somewhat deeper note, have been thinking a lot about the old man
lately.  i know not how often he crosses your minds - mine not too often for
obvious reasons.  but what with asian travels and chinese sauciness, i feel
like he would actually have taken a keen interest in some things i have been
doing, you know?  not just the sort of obligatory parental interest, but on
a personal level.  Lord knows none of us quite understood his fascination
with this corner of the world.  i used to think that he must have
entertained a healthy appreciation for the wimmins over here - much like
myself - but considering the buxom alpha female he married  that does not
hold much water.  it is not so important now, of course, but there sure are
some things i would like to have a chinwag with him about.



all y'all too, for that matter, and it is coming in a matter of weeks. some
details have yet to be reckoned but this much is known:  april 16 to may 10
will see my return stateside.  it may sound like a lot of time but it ain't,
so let me run this by y'all.  either the weekend of april 22 or 29
(saturdays) it would be a good and great thing to gather at the pedernales
with just the familia.  would be?  strike that from the record - it will be!
so make haste to clear your calendar and pencil that in.  danna, do what
you can.  ricardo, if your job is truly so high-falutin' you should not have
any trouble getting off.  namuski, could we drive down friday morn?  john of
the taj mahal, i know you need notice and now you have it.  dearest mama, if
some horrid Angela Landsbury rerun is on you'll just have to miss it.
stevo?  am coming to see your ass in orlando!



but i implore y'all - do not let something keep you away from the pedernales
in april.  it has been many a moon and i need to visit with y'all.  y'all
need to visit with each other.  we all need to pay homage to the Great
She-Elephant.  take friday off and get there for an extra day, for Pete's
sake.  i will let you know which weekend shortly - probably the 29th but not
positive yet, and figure y'all do not want to have easter there.



it would seem as if a whole lot is happening with everyone.  john is
building the casa and keeping it together in spite of the odds,  jean helen
is going to drop come springtime, doug is going to begin estrogen
injections, ricardo is going to continue to make something out of nothing
and nothing out of something, and danna is going to get back to hallowed
ground at long last.  what a smile.  what a big smile that is.   best news i
have heard since dad bought the pedernales.



did y'all go down there rich doug and john?



alrighty then - this has been monstrously long.  okay - bye bye.  hope all
y'all have found the Noughties to be as fine a vintage as i have so far and
may this belated new years note find you all faring well with mo' glide in
yo' stride and mo' dip in yo' hip.



my work is done.  rolland

Before Christmas, I was selling calendars for Jason's Church Youth Camp Fund
Raiser.  I would like to thank those of you who supported him during this
time.

The church had some of the calendars left over so I volunteered to help sell
the remaining ones for $2.00 instead $6.00 each since we are halfway through
February.  Please let me know if you would like one.  The money will also go
towards the Youth Camp scheduled for this summer.

I have 7 of them left.  Thanks again!!!

Gas OII Parties

Per our discussion at the April 10 meeting to discuss draft tariffs to
implement the PG&E Gas OII settlement, PG&E is providing the following
materials:

* Revised Gas OII and PG&E Tariff Preparation Schedule.  The testimony
and hearing schedule adopted at the April 11 prehearing conference is now
included, along with revised dates for the tariff approval process for
PG&E's settlement.  Please remember that much of this schedule is
speculative - and highly dependent on the actual timing of Commission
actions and presumes we can achieve broad consensus on tariff language. For
PG&E's settlement tariffs, we have delayed our providing a next draft until
May 25.  We need the extra time to address the issues raised at the April 10
meeting, and to further explore our internal process requirements.  We
therefore delayed our next tariff meeting until June 27, which should be
after hearings and opening briefs on SoCal matters.  If the litigation
schedule changes, we may need to revisit our tariff preparation schedule.

* List of Issues.  This list is compiled from the April 10 meeting,
plus the April 6 CPAG meeting.  As we work through these issues, we may be
contacting individual parties to further discuss the issue before we send
out our next tariff draft.  Please let us know if you have comments or
additions to this list.

* Exhibit A to Attachment K to the CTA Request Form, proposed CTA bill
format.  A draft of this proposed bill format Exhibit has been completed
since we sent out the last package. The attached table is for your
information on the source of various elements to be included in the bill
format, and would not be part of the final Exhibit.  If you have questions
or comments on this Exhibit, please include Cathy Bretz on your E-mail
(clbe@pge.com) or call her at 415-973-3140.

* Core Rate Impacts of CTA Storage Unbundling.  An illustration of the
expected rate impacts of this program was completed since we sent out the
last package.  This illustration was presented at the CPAG and Tariff Review
meetings. If you have questions or comments on this attachment, please
include Jerry Miller on your E-mail (grm8@pge.com) or call him at
415-973-4104.

We also continue to welcome comments or concerns you may have on the draft
tariffs for our Comprehensive Gas OII Settlement.  We will try to respond to
them in our next draft tariff package, to be sent May 25.

Thanks to those parties who attended the April 10 meeting and provided
excellent comments and suggestions.

Sincerely,


Randy Litteneker

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I will send out a real legislative report next week.  In the meantime, I
thought you might appreciate a quick run-down of what actually happened in
the final hours of this year's wild legislative session.
The good news is that the public benefit charge bill passed easily with a
10-year term and no statutory harm was done.  The bad news is that utilities
captured the deregulation debate and successfully painted generators as
villains and the wholesale market as "broken."
Major legislative actions on energy matters follow.  If you have any
questions or would like a copy of final legislation, please call.
AB 995 (Wright) and SB 1194 (Sher), which extend public benefit charges for
energy conservation, renewable energy development, and RD&D, passed the
State Legislature by large margins.  Recent indications are that the
Governor will sign the bills, although interested companies should join IEP
in sending letters urging him to do so.
Power plant siting was front and center the last week of the session.  As
recently as Wednesday of this week, the bill was so bad for new power plant
development that IEP opposed the expedited siting provisions.  They were
rewritten by Republican staff and CEC attorneys to provide a 6-month process
for a mitigated negative declaration of environmental impacts that might
help those few entities that can start the process in full compliance with
local rules.  This provision is available for both combined cycle facilities
and peaking facilities.  The bill also includes a provision for four-month
approval of amendments to pending applications providing for the
installation of temporary peaking generation  on sites that will be
developed into combined cycle facilities within three years.  The CEC
expects this to apply so a single pending application.  Finally, the bill
includes language directing the CPUC and the EOB to be helpful on ISO issues
that affect the willingness self-generators to remain interconnected with
the grid.
Utility efforts to craft legislation assuring them of collection of large
negative balances in their Transition Revenue Accounts failed when they
could not reach agreement with representatives of large customer groups.  In
its place, the Legislature passed a non-binding resolution directing the
CPUC to investigate the issue and including highly offensive language on
$100 price caps and retroactive recalculation of market clearing prices.
Legislation establishing a retroactive cap on SDG&E rates and providing no
assurance of cost recovery to Sempra passed the Legislature.  Companion
legislation that most observers expect the Governor to veto provides $150
million of General Fund money to SDG&E.
A draft of so-called "sunshine" legislation surfaced late in the process.
The draft empowered the Electricity Oversight Board to collect anything it
might be interested in from the ISO, PX, utilities, generators, and
marketers and to treat the information confidentially.  The draft faced
unified opposition and did not make its way into any legislation.
AB 1002 (Wright) establishing public benefit charges on the natural gas
system passed the Legislature.  It continues to include language exempting
electricity generation from the charges.

Hi Mark, I have not met you yet but heard a lot of good things about you.  I
would like to discuss with you and possibly with John Bloomer and Richard
Reichardt about the EBS Research's role in supporting the Storage market
development from the origination and trading perspective.  There are several
people in various groups that are talking about storage but here is what's my
take on our involvement--please correct me or suggest otherwise.

Shalesh Ganjoo is our lead analyst on this effort.  In addition to his effort
with your group, he is presently supporting Jean Mrha with pricing and
standardization for a traded storage maret--Stinson Gibner is directly
supervising him in this effort.

Shalesh came to us through referal from David Cox--David discovered him at
one of his speaking engagements.  Shalesh had talked to David about traded
storage market development some time last October and David refered Shalesh
to Enron Research group. We hired Shalesh for general analyst position and
now he is pulled into all aspect of this storage effort.  Currently, he is
our point person (with Stinson or I supervising his effort) who is supporting
Jean Mrha and you on the subject.  Kara Knop has aproached Shalesh with
request for some support and Shalesh and she are sorting out each other,s
role in this regard.  As per my discussion today with David, we need to
coordinate this storage effort from the perspective of modeling market
assessment etc. For this I suggest Shalesh and his effort so that all parties
involved can benefit from collective effort within one central source.  Based
on David's and my assessment of Shalesh's capabilities, I would like to
suggest that the commercial heads use Shalesh for his creative thinking,
understanding of the market and analytical capabilities and not just for data
gathering and simple research effort. We can add other staff as we see the
need and as you request them.

Please respond this e-mail with your comments if this sounds like aplan, so
that we can support this effort efficiently and in a scalable manner.

Kind Regards,

Ravi.


A bit about EBS Research Group

John Bloomer and Richard Reichardt have met me and are aware of my role and
Stinston Gibner's role in EBS. I lead a team of quantitative professionals
via a group we are calling EBS Research.  This group reports to Stinson
Gibner (VP) and Vince Kaminski (MD and Head of Enron Research).  Stinson and
Vince are the original founders of Enron Corp Research that has been charged
with model development efforts to support Enron Energy trading and other
Enron business.  Enron Research is involved in all aspects of Enron buinesses
(EES, International, Corporate affairs such as FAS 133 and other accounting
and new product (derivatives) development, etc.).

Within EBS Research, there serveral professionals supporting Kevin Howard
(CFO office), John Griebling, Tom Gros and Jean Mrha, David Cox (via Boris),
and the War room.  Our main area of focus is with Jean Mrha (trading) and
John Griebling (optical network design and optimization, etc.).  We play a
key role with John Griebling's go forward network design and implementation
through our responsiblity to provide traffic engineering analysis and
modeling effort.

Hi Stinson, as per our discussion, here is the e-mail from Jim on the
subject.  I convinced Jim that this type of modeling effort is our gig and he
completely agrees.  As per Jim's suggestion, he and I will talk more on the
product while we are in Denver. I suspect that we will arrange for the vendor
to come to Houston and do a presentation on the product and install the
product on our machines.   As for additional development we should get John
Bloomer and Jim together in a meeting and hash out the requirements from John
Bloomer's perspective.

Using Vince's analogy, this tool allows us to deternime the size of the cargo
space needed for Fedex-like delivery (our streaming media products). Whereas,
the optical light path switching (DS-3, OC-3, OC-12 and OC-48) based trading
will reserve the underlying airline routes, etc.  So the packet based stuff
is looking at the required capacity from IP layer (Network and Transport:
level 3 and 4) requirements. The optical light path is Level 1 & 2 based
requirements.  That is this tool will allow John Bloomer to size (actually we
will do the analysis for him) the capacity requirement that he would need for
the products that he is developing.

That is my take on the difference, we'll find out otherwise.

Once I finish off this discussion with Jim in Denver, I suggest putting
Martin Lin on the job to find out more about the product and do the leg work
to arrange for vendor demo and software installation.  Martin will keep Samer
and Chonawee updated on the information that he gathers.  Martin please start
checking on the web about this company and other similiar produts. I will get
you contact number for EBS and the vendor as soon as Jim provides them to
me.

Avici uses this product. Avici is a next generation router vendor that is
selling Terabit routers. EBS is an investor in that company.

Ravi.

rate impacts and evidence that the settlement is in the public  interest.
The other settlement parties will filetestimony from the  perspective on
what the settlement means to their clients and why the settlement  is in the
public interest. Parties have also agreed to prepare  declarations for the
settlement to be filed on April 17, drafts which must be  circulated prior to
the 3PM conference call scheduled for Thursday  afternoon.

The  tentative assignment of testimony preparation responsibilitiesare
identified as follows:

SoCalGasMechanics  of Capacity and Retail
Unbundling(separatetestimony for  capacity and retail)
WGS/WHP/Enron  Transmission, Storage and Balancing Unbundling
Edison/Calpine/DynegyPricing  and Benefits to Electric Generators

Industry Expert)
ORA  Unbundling Policy and Core Impacts
TXU/ShellCore  Interstate Capacity Unbundling
Transwestern  Primary and Secondary Receipt Point Access
Indicated  ProducersOpen Season  and Impacts on California

CalpineMetering  Program

The  parties also agreed that we need to counter the lobbying impacts of
TURN/SCGC,  who have been making the rounds on the 5th floor and suggesting
that industry  restructuring is no longer necessary and harms customers in
southern  California. If I have missed something, please let me know. I
would  also like to discuss with the parties on Thursday a schedule for
review and  comment on the prepared testimonies. I suggest that we try and
get our  first drafts out no later than April 24. Let me know what you
think.

Hi Paul and Anad, please make the appropriate arrangements (via Enron Corp.
AA pool) to "rotate" Martin Lin into my group. As you know, I am heading up
the EBS research unit that is reporting to Vince Kaminski and Stinson Gibner
(MD & VP of Enron Research Group, respectively).  Martin will work for Jim
Irvine and report to him on a day-to-day basis.  Martin will spend most of
his time at Jim's office location.  This arrangement is very similar to Samar
Khleif's role in Portland with John McClain's broadband delivery group.

Martin has already discussed his rotation with Jim Irvine and scheduled to
start on March 1, 00.   EBS Research will be working very closely with Jim
Irvine and John Griebling in the area of Network Planning and Model
Development (Traffic Engineering in telecom-speak).  Martin has a Ph.D. in
Electrical Engineering and has been working within Research supporting
electricity transmission analysis and modeling.

Regards,

Ravi.

Dave,
Credit Houston received yesterday a partial list of counterparties to whom
this product should be shown. We are still waiting for a final list of
reference credits and are trying to confirm with Credit London that they have
received a list of trading counterparties. Profiles still need to be created
for all trading counterparties based on the products for EOL.
As of this minute, I would say that we have signed off on the concept but
details and individual approvals are not complete. Bill spoke with Bryan last
night and communicated this to him as well.
A Monday launch looks a bit optimistic given the data on hand and tasks left
to do. Being a US holiday for Enron doesn't help either.
Let me know how things progress from your end.

Attached is a resume for a gentleman who has relocated as a trailing expat

in Enron. I know that one or two of you have already seen his resume and at
the time didn't necessarily have a role for him. I would be very grateful if
you could take another look and see if anything has now changed.

By way of background, he was previously working with Eastern in the UK in a
back office capacity looking at their approach to the UK Gas regulatory
framework known as the Network code. He has done a little consulting work
since relocating to Houston in the online area. His references are very good.
He is available with immigration clearance as a local hire, probably at
Senior Specialist level. As an additional "incentive" I would be prepared to
underwrite his costs in the event you decided in the first 6 months that his
performance did not meet your expectations (Obviously - I am highly confident
this will not be the case!).

What ever became of Dan Bates anyway? I don't know, but Bill Jannsson
e-mailed to say that he was coming to the party to provide some adult
leadership. Jim Wallace is a yes, according to a recent message I received
from him. And Elvis assures me that Paul Porter is a definite YES!

Let's hear some more from our brothers in the classes of '72, '73, '74 and
'76. And what about you guys in the upper mid west? Pretty quiet up
there. I might have to unleash Woody on you. Here's a sampling of  his
persuasive cajoling:

"...andDr.
Fullerton is trying to clear
his heart transplant  calendar as we speak. I said to him, "Fu, what's more
important, a  fricking heart transplant or a chance to end up face down in
the gutter with  your pledge brothers?" Think it really hit home with him on
that  one. I mean, what can you say to THAT? Should be a new low. Can't
wait."

He's got a way with words.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Tino called today to report on their meetings with DOE last week.  Tino,
Dennis Langley, and their outside lawyer Jim Slattery met with Bill
Richardson and DOE staff to discuss the "sole source" procurement approach to
DOE's obtaining an alternative power supplier for Kirtland AFB and Sandia.
Tino reports that Richardson signed off on the sole source approach, subject
only to DOE review of the final contract to assure its consistency with the
public interest.  Tino believes that the combination of significant Native
American involvement in the overall deal structure along with a power price
that is lower than DOE's current PNM rates will satisfy the "public interest"
standard.

Slattery is set to begin discussions with DOE next week on the overall
structure of Dennis' proposal.  I am surprised that Dennis would go this far
before hearing from us on the economics, but Tino made it sound like the
initial discussions would be fairly general--i.e., to explain to DOE that the
plan is to build a new pipeline and a new power plant and to do the whole
thing in partnership with the Isleta Tribe, but without talking about
specific economic issues.  Sounds to me like Dennis has Richardson on board
but is nevertheless planning to pitch to the lower level DOE staff people
what a great deal this is for the Tribes and therefore the government.

Tino, not surprisingly, is eager to see numbers and sit down to discuss
them.  He suggested a meeting the first week of May in either Houston or KC.
I asked Tino whether he could get firmer numbers from DOE than we currently
have on (1) total electric and gas load (current and projected) for the AFB
and Sandia and (2) actual price DOE currently pays for gas and power.  He
didn't think he could get better information before the first week in May.

On another related topic, through Shelley Corman's group  I got acquainted
with a guy named Tim Beldon who runs the ENA transmission capacity book for
the Western U.S., out of Portland.  I talked with him for a few minutes about
power flows and pricing in the N.M-Arizona area and he seemed pretty
knowledgable.  He has a transmission engineer on his team who is an expert in
verifying utility claims of transmission constraints.  Apparently, ENA buys
and sells a lot of power in the four corners area and is pretty familiar with
the transmission availabilty and power pricing situation up there.  I didn't
discuss with Tim the specifics of the project we are looking at, but did tell
him that Kevin and Steve were looking at a potential power plant load and
trying to figure out how serious it is.  Kevin, if you guys think Beldon
could provide useful info on the cost and availability of firm and non-firm
transmission for the surplus power out of Albequerque up to four corners,
please give him a call.  It is OK to disclose to Beldon what we are working
on, but please inform him that we are subject to a confidentiality agreement
and that further disclosure is improper.

Please let me know whether a meeting with these guys the first week of May is
doable.  Thanks.  DF

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Howdy.  I wrote the following last month while I was in Northern Cyprus.
Hope you enjoy it.

*  *  *

Maras, The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus -- Attached to the rusting
chain-link fence I am approaching are several blood red signs, on which are
stenciled both the black silhouette of the top half of a faceless soldier
holding a rifle and a warning, in Turkish, that "Fotograf Cekmek Yasaktir
[To Take Photographs Is Forbidden]".  The fence, no longer quite plumb in
the soft sand, seems to stumble across the beach, eventually ending at a
gently lapping Mediterranean. There a tangle of wires attached to the fence
extends a short way into the surf, making anyone's effort to outflank it
obviously intentional.  The Turkish soldiers patrolling the non-man's land
beyond, to the south, could thus treat such an intruder, I suppose, in
whatever way they might see fit.

In the other direction, the fence, before it has completely left the beach,
cuts sharply north, running in front of the hulks of four empty resort
hotels.  Above them in the deep blue of the pre-dusk sky hangs a crescent
moon, the same phased moon that graces the flags of both Turkey and the
Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus.  One of the hotels still has the
remnants of an identifying sign, with just two of its six letter Greek name
remaining.  Another hotel, the smallest and no doubt at one time the
quaintest, has slatted wooden shutters covering the windows and doors
leading out to tiny porches.  Some of the shutters have rusted off their
hinges then fallen forward against the porch railings, and now point out to
sea as if giving urgent warning.  Others hang limply, defeated, from a
single remaining hinge.
Most surprisingly, every one of the windows I can see in the hotels is
either missing or broken.  I am taken back by such thoroughness, given that
the most likely motivation was vindictiveness.  I struggle to find a loftier
one, wondering if there was perhaps some valid security consideration, such
as making these somewhat strategically set buildings unattractive to
squatters.  Maybe -- though I find this thought the most troubling -- it had
been done just for the fun of it.





The fence I am walking along marks the border between inhabited and
uninhabited Maras, the Turkish Cypriot's name for the town Greek Cypriots
call Varosha.  The uninhabited part has been off limits since the Turkish
army invaded Cyprus in 1974.  Before that invasion the small Turkish Cypriot
minority had lived uneasily amongst the Greek Cypriot majority, though in
the years since 1960, when Cyprus was given its independence by the English,
periodic outbreaks of inter-communal violence had led to increased
segregation and emigration.  The invasion, launched after a coup on the
island and another particularly vicious spat of violence, eventually put an
end to even this limited association -- as it did the worst of the violence.
The Turkish army went on to occupy roughly the northern most 40% of the
island, which was accompanied and followed by one of the last century's all
too familiar mass cross-migrations.  The northern "half" is now home to
nearly all of the island's Turkish Cypriots, close to 20% of the total
population.

The border between the north and south, known as the Atilla Line, is one of
the many UN patrolled "blue lines" in the world.  Maras actually falls
within Northern Cyprus, with the Attila Line further to the south.  It is
controlled now by the Turkish army.  At the time of the invasion the town
had been a thriving, up and coming resort town, run mostly by Greek
Cypriots.  Indeed, all over Cyprus, since its independence -- despite the
periodic, deadly violence -- tourism had been booming.  But here in Maras,
at least, the boom is no more.  The forty or so thousand Greek Cypriots who
once owned, ran or otherwise worked there, fled in panic before the
advancing Turkish army, reportedly leaving behind uncleared breakfast dishes
on tables and washing on lines, some forgetting to turn off lights that
burned on and on for years.

UN sponsored "proximity talks" between the North and the South  -- called
proximity talks because the negotiating leaders will not met face to face --
started in New York on December 4th.  They are set to continue in Geneva
this January 31st.  The return of Maras to its former mostly Greek Cypriot
owners, or more precisely their return to it, is no doubt high on this
meeting's (thus far secret) agenda, as it has been over the years at the
many similar, though always fruitless, negotiations.  This time around,
however, expectations are running higher than usual, primarily because of a
positive change in the dynamic between the two side's by far most important
sponsor states, Turkey and Greece.  Turkey, for example, has recently
acquired candidacy status within the European Union, which commits it to
resolving among other things its disputes with EU member Greece.  Greece, on
the other hand, has lately suffered a series of embarrassments on the
international stage, the biggest of which was being caught last February
having given sanctuary to fugitive Kurdish separatist leader -- and
terrorist in most people's minds -- Abdullah "Apo" Ocalan.  Coupled with the
significant good will garnered in the wake of the tremendous assistance
Turkey and Greece gave each other after their twin earthquake disasters last
year, the two countries just may be willing to push their client states
toward a deal.





The point where the fence meets the sea marks the end of the gentle curve of
the short beach I am walking.  Behind me, at this beach's other end, is
inhabited Maras' nicest hotel (oddly sporting an English name, the Palm
Beach Hotel).  If you looked in that direction, taking in only the fine
hotel, the attractive beach, the dark blue sea, you might think you were in
a tourist paradise.  But this is no paradise.  As I walk the last few feet
to the fence I begin to see another beach emerge, much longer than the one I
am on, sweeping south most of the way to the horizon.  There are more
hotels, which I knew from what I had read were also empty.  But my reading
has not prepared me for the monstrous proportions of it all.  First, in the
distance, one, two, three empty hotels quickly come into view, then, more
slowly, dozens more.  At the fence, with the entire beach now visible, I
count more than thirty of them, and these just on the waterfront.

Just beyond the fence are a few pieces of ancient playground equipment
scattered about the sand.  I try to imagine the happy cries of the children
as their parents, more than twenty- five years before, pushed them round and
round in dizzying circles on the miniature merry-go-around, now rusted and
partially buried by drifted sand.  There is a long slide too, though
half-tumbled down, one of its rusted supports having twisted and collapsed
after so many years of weather and neglect.  My own memories of childhood
end at no such place now trapped inside a militarized no-man's land.  How
different life must seem to those whose memories do.  What sorts of dreams
are built on this type of innocence lost?

I turn around and walk to the Palm Beach Hotel, along the way wondering if
it was merely luck that had left it on the business side of the fence.  On
its porch I chose a chair, since it has become cold, near a partly cracked
door through which comes a warm draft.  I order a cup of tea.  As the
evening grows darker, so does the abandoned town spread out before me.  The
crescent moon is now higher in the sky and, together with a strategically
placed star, provides a tiny bright exclamation point over the entire dismal
scene below.

At that moment two energetic young men burst through the door.  The bigger
of the two is gripping the arm of the other, directing him forward to the
porch's railing.

"Bak [look]!" he says in Turkish, gesturing out toward the sea with a broad
sweep of his free arm.  "Harika, degil mi [Wonderful, isn't it]?"

"Evet, cok guzel [Yes, very beautiful]", his friend agrees.

They stand gazing out over the sea, though after a brief moment I see the
smaller man's head turn toward the darkened hulks that line the shore.  The
bigger man glances at his friend, sees where he is looking, then looks
himself.  They are both silent for quite some time before the bigger man
returns his attention to his friend, squeezes his arm.  His friend, as if
awakening from a trance, slowly pulls his gaze from the ruins, smiles up at
his companion.  After two identical, simultaneous shrugs, they chuckle
uneasily, shaking their heads as they do.

When they turn to return to the door, I holler out to them. "Baris mumkun mu
[Is peace possible]?"

They stop, look at me with frowns of curiosity.  "Nerelisiniz [Where are you
from]?"  It is the big one who had taken the lead.

"Amerikali"yim [I'm an American]."

His frown deepens, though now for a different reason.  "Belki dort, bes yil
sonra [Maybe four, five years from now], belki hic bir zaman yok [maybe
never]."

"Ama, ne hakkinda otuz bir ocak, bir yeni baris gurusmesi [But, what about
January 31st, the new peace negotiations] (?"

"Hah!" he exclaims, interrupting me. "Her zamen yeni baris gorumesi var
[There are always new peace negotiations]!"

He thereupon dismisses my inference with the same sweeping arm gesture he
used to introduce, to his friend, the sea.

Matt,
Good report.  I am concerned about this expert's conclusions, the most
troubling of which is that our putting the ship on notice of the end use of
the cargo would have been of so little importance.  That is probably our
strongest point.  I also share your concern about his lack of experience as a
witness in an arbitration.  We need an expert who is well respected by U.K.
arbitrators and their tribunals.  I will likewise try to get other names.
Meanwhile, I question whether we should ask Capt Sawant to put anything in
writing concerning how to beef up his second report until we talk further.  I
am concerned that anything he puts in writing may be discoverable in a U.K.
arbitration proceeding if we use him as an expert and/or if he has any
otherwise discoverable factual information.  Would you mind passing this
concern by WFW for its comment?  I am assuming that the WFW counsel with whom
you are speaking are experienced maritime arbitration counsel.
Thank you for keeping us advised.  Deborah, please print this out (including
the attachment) for the file.

Charlene,
I am sending you as promised the information I have about 3 of our summer
interns.
I shall fax you this morning two additional resumes I have in hard copy.
In the case of Paulo Rocha we don't have a formal
resume, just a letter from him with the summary of his skills.
Thanks for your help. Enron desperately needs this talent.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I will be holding a conference call today at 11:00 AM (Central time) for the
purpose of relating some information I have received from Rod Boshcee of
PG&E.  The conference number is 1-800-991-9019, passcode 6000796.  Rod left a
very friendly detailed message on my voice mail yesterday afternoon related
to the upcoming proposed shutdown and testing of the separators at Topock
(which they previously agreed would be done around September 11 or 12.  He
asked on the voice mail that I give him a call back and let him know what our
decision is as soon as possible.

The following will attempt to summarize his voice mail message and will be
the subject of our call today:
Rod stated that when we were together at Flagstaff in July we had decided to
again take the system down and sample the separators around September 11 and
12.
He said PG&E has continued to monitor their unit and have found nothing new
since the June 29 test.
Rod also said that they have gotten consistent numbers downstream since June
29 and everything seems stabilized.
He said that PG&E is "happy" with the operation of the separators and they
seem to be doing the job that TW had said they would do.
Rod said that PG&E would go along with TW's thoughts on it, but they were
wondering if it was really necessary to take the system down in mid-September
or not since things were looking good?  He said they could go either way on
it.
Rod closed by saying that they still had some concern about the sterility of
the 1800' of pipe that connects TW's Meter Run with PG&E's Topock Compressor
Station.  However, it seemed to be OK for now and they would have no other
thoughts on it as long as the numbers stay consistently low on their side.
He asked that we let him know what we want to do as soon as possible so
scheduling will not be a problem.

I would propose that we discuss this matter and then we can call him back and
furnish our recommendation.  The cooperative tone of his call is something we
want to continue to build upon and I do want us to be promptly responsive in
that regard.  Thanks, John

A few months ago I interviewed on the phone Carlos Ibarguen for possible
opportunties at Enron.  He is very impressive, was pursuing his Masters in
Public Administration from the London School of Economics, is bilingual, was
the Embassy Rep for Bolivia in Washington, DC and has consulting experience
in promoting private  investments in Bolivia.

He is interested in working at Enron and I believe would be an excellent
candidate for us.  Transredes in Bolivia has begun the interview process with
him as they are looking for someone to work in External Affairs.
Carlos completes his Masters 9/1 and will then return to Bolivia. He is
actively interviewing now and has one offer and is anticipating another.

His resume is attached and he will follow up directly with Steve, Jose and
Mike to further present himself.  Carlos would be interested in being hired
into the ESA local Associate and Analyst program if the rotations included a
concentration in Regulatory/Government Affairs as this is his career
objective.



thanks,

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Dear all,

Anjam and myself  had a highly productive and informative set of meetings
with Andreas Barkchis of MG Metals NY on Thursday 20th July in the NY
office.  Firstly we should say "thanks" to Andreas for being so helpful in
addressing out numerous requests for information - we look forward to
establishing a solid working relationship with him going forward.

Find below a summary of Version_1a for initial rough calculation of MG
Metal's VAR.

Also Anjam, Kirstee (from London side) and Cantekin, Grant, Vince and myself
(Houston side) have been working for last 2 days on the spreadsheet VAR
model.
The current status of this effort and a plan for future progress is
summarized in the enclosed document:

______________________________________________________________________________
_______________________________________________________
V@R methodology for MG Metals positions
Version_1a

Introduction
This document describes the initial rough model for calculations
Value-At-Risk for MG Metals. This model will be implemented in a spreadsheet,
which will serve as a prototype for the RiskTrac implementation.

Risk factors
The following positions represent most of MG Metal,s risk and will be covered
by Version_1a:
- Base metals, positions including:
- aluminium;
- copper;
- gold;
- lead;
- nickel;
- silver;
- tin;
- zinc;
Risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward
prices for each metal.
- Copper concentrate;
Risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating TC charges.
- Cocoa beans;
Risk related to these positions will be quantified by simulating forward
prices for cocoa beans.

Therefore these 10 curves will drive the risk: price curves for aluminium,
copper, gold, lead, nickel, silver, tin, zinc and cocoa beans plus tc curve
for copper concentrate.

Assumptions and simplifications:
- For each metal we are going to use a single price curve or all types of
products (physical, financial, LME traded, Comex traded, scrap, alloy, stock,
etc.);
- Delta, gamma approach for risk on options, positions;

Components required to implement V@R model:
- current forward prices available from Mercur;
- current implied volatilities available through Reuters;
- current positions from Mercur;
- history of prices required to calculate factor loadings and correlations
across commodities;

Methodology
Version_1a will be based on Risk Matrix approach. We will calculate principal
components for each metal and cocoa beans to take in account the correlations
along the term structure. We will also calculate the correlations across
commodities based on prompt month prices history for last 3 months.

Portfolio hierarchy
Each position will be assigned to one of the following portfolios under the
whole portfolio AGG-METALS:
- MG Metal & Commodity Corp.
- MG Ltd.;
- MG Metal & Commodity Company Ltd.;
- MG Metall Recycling GmbH, Ffm;

Under each of these sub-portfolio there will be the following sub-portfolios:
- Comex;
- Frame contract;
- LME;
- LME Alloy;
- LME Metal Index;
- Option Call;
- Option Put;
- Physical;
- Physical Alloy;
- Physical Real;
- Physical Scrap;
- Price Part.;
- Prov. Billing;
- Stock;
- Stock Alloy;
- Stock Comex;
- Stock Physical;
- Stock Scrap;

well hello to my beloved kinsmen and token Basque-in-law.  tonight i have
set aside Ralph Ellison to send a brief missive to all y'all in the hopes
that it may atone for anything bizarre which may have occurred in the most
recent communique.  i vaguely recall some coherency at the beginning, but by
four thirty in the morn God only knows what was written.



mother are you listening to that tape?



not a whole lot to report on the itinerary front, though i hope for a
gathering on either Easter weekend or the one after.  does that present a
problem for anyone?  let me know por favor and be quick about it - tickets
muy inflexible will be purchased as soon as i hear from a woman in ye olde
boston towne.



wrote said woman a love letter the other day - nay, the other week as it
took about five revisions - and just now my heart is in my throat as we are
waiting for the reply.  never, never reread a love letter - how could what
must surely be the #1 rule of writing those things have been unknown to me?



upon recollection it has occurred to me that my older male siblings did not
learn me jack shit about the amorous side of life - pitching woo and goin'
courting.  thanks for nada, boys - your collective inattention left me in
the rather hapless position of having to make a study of mack daddy murry
trying to smooth talk danna, and strangely enough it was none other than the
Paternal Unit who imparted the most influence on me.  so basically that
letter reads like pops talking to Arthur and borrows heavily from the time
he tried to talk my ass into going to the palo pinto county prom with candy
hodgkins.



makes us just about cringe out loud even fourteen years removed, that memory
does.  yuck.



well next month am headed to guam for a few days of fun in the sun with an
ozzie mate and a new yorker.  not the most exotic locale, but should be
packed with enough randy nubile nipponese lasses to bring out the sexual
Tyrannosaurus in yours truly.  yeah baby!



so sad about tom landry, but not quite as sad as watching phil collins make
a laughingstock of himself in that absurd super bowl halftime show.  john,
you used to make excuses for him, but i will stomach them no more!



by the way, has anyone actually received an email from the Great She-
Elephant, or does she just read them?  since when did the path of passivity
suit you best, camille-san?  for pete's sake turn off the petula clark
record, stop watching the stock market channel as if something immediately
discernible is about to happen, stub out the ciggie and give a holler!



well there is a whole lot more to say but i reckon it just might be better
done in a matter of weeks in person, face to face, mano a mano

and soul to soul (SRV!)   and so it is until then, sans the comfort of the
bosom of my clan, that i remain much like the proverbial dog without a bone,
the gook without a bowl of rice, chico without the man and a pimp without
his bitches.  see y'all soon - miss y'all heaps

Peter,

Following a last read through last night, I now attach the final versions of:

(a) the letter to Christopher Jones; and

(b) the "unattributable" Memorandum.

I am just about to have the letter signed by Joe, when we shall courier it
with the Memo immediately to Christopher today.

Hence, please now feel free to e-mail the letter and the Memo to Christopher,
as we discussed.

With regards to copying the letter to Mr Albers at DG Competition, Clifford
Chance Amsterdam have advised that we do have to be a little careful with how
he views the copy - if he treats it as being more formal than simply
informational, then it could cut us off at the knees with our NMa Complaint.
Hence, I am going to draft a brief letter this morning also for signing by
Joe, which will stress that the copy is simply for informational purposes
following a request made of you in this regard by Christopher in your recent
discussions with him (i.e., Christopher) and to emphasize that we are already
pursuing a Complaint on the issues with the NMa.  I will let you have a look
at the draft covering letter, before I ask Joe to sign it, for your approval
/ comments.

Kind regards - and many thanks for your help over the past few days with the
above.

Mark

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Personal and Confidential
Privileged Solicitor and Client Communication
As many of you know, I met with Chris Calger yesterday in Portland.  I
will be preparing a memorandum of my conversation with Chris which I
will ask him to review for distribution.  In summary, Chris was frank
and open, and in my view, expressed genuine corporate concern with the
investigation.  I believe that my notes will indicate that Chris did not
have direct contact with PowerX in connection with any particular trade
during the period being investigated by the government.  Although, in my
view, Chris had general knowledge of Enron*s approach taken in
connection with bidding power into the pool, he did not see himself as
spearheading or orchestrating that process.  I hope to prepare my memo
today for review by Chris later in the day.
PowerX has retained the law firm of Lawson Lundell in Vancouver to
represent their interest.  The lawyer is Chris Sanderson who is a senior
member of the B.C. and Alberta Bars.  His practice focuses on regulatory
law and civil litigation, particularly in the energy industry.
I spoke to Chris Sanderson today to introduce myself and to give him a
very general background on the investigation conducted at the Calgary
office.  He reported that a similar investigation had taken place in the
PowerX office in Vancouver.  Their investigation started at the same
time as ours and ended on Thursday of last week.
Chris Sanderson did confirm that there are tapes of conversations with
Enron involving these various trades.  As a result, I suspect that these
tapes ought to contain the same dialogue that is contained on our tapes.
I did not get into any discussion as to the information that may be
contained on the tapes and exactly what information had been seized by
the government.  I did get the impression, however, that the government
has taken possession of tapes from PowerX.
He indicated that in his preliminary view the documents themselves are
not the concern but the tapes are.  Again, I did not discuss any
particular matter with respect to the tapes only that Enron did keep
taped conversations of trades undertaken by its traders.
I think it would be worthwhile, and he agreed, if Glenn Leslie and I,
and perhaps Web, met with Chris at the appropriate time.  He is open to
entertain a dialogue between counsel subject of course to matters of
privilege and commonality of interest.
He indicated that he wants to take approximately two weeks to review the
evidence obtained by the investigators (he has not done so yet and
preferred having a firm knowledge of the information seized by the
government before talking to us) and thereafter, initiate a dialogue
with us to see what information might be worth sharing.
I will have Glenn Leslie give him a call to try to set a date when we
might meet with him.  We might want to discuss briefly during our
telephone conference on Friday our approach to meeting with Lawson
Lundell and what would be our ultimate objectives in doing so.
Yesterday, I talked to Cliff O*Brien, the counsel retained for John
Lavorato, and tried to give him a very brief overview of the issues.
Unfortunately, I was at the Portland airport when I did talk to him and
had to keep my conversation somewhat cryptic.  Cliff did meet with John
Lavorato for approximately two hours last night.  Cliff called me this
morning and would like to meet with me.  I will meet him at 4:00 today.
Cliff indicated that the matter was more complex than he had imagined
and expressed a view that in John*s opinion these were simple trades and
nothing else.  I will report to you further on this after I have had a
chance to meet with Cliff O*Brien.
If any of you have any questions, please don*t hesitate to call.  In any
event, we will be talking at our regularly scheduled conference call
Friday at 10:30 (central time).
Regards,

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Light volume, positive day... yawn, yawn... then after the close: the
biggest non-news news of the millennium - Judge Jackson ruled to break-up
Mr. Softee.  MSFT sold off initially (after being up small on the day) but
is trading up over 2 as I write this (5:45PM NY Time).  Gates is defiant and
feels that things will go his way on appeal - he might be right but given
Mr. Bill's penchant for seeming arrogant it was abit odd to see him as the
front man dismissing questions about the naming of the second company as if
it were completely out of the realm of possibility.  A more tempered, less
emotional, less personal response might have been abit more comforting for
stockholders - many people feel Mr. Bill's hubris got them into this mess to
begin with - look at INTC and CSCO - they know when to tip their hat at
Uncle Sam and stay out of the court room.  The key is the restrictions which
are supposed to go into effect in 90 days - Gates feels very very very very
confident that they will be thrown out and Mr. Softee will suffer no harm
during the appeal - evidentially many after hours traders share his view.
They seem unconcerned of the threat to the new MSFT net strategy - which is
to be announced at the end of June.  In the broader markets - it was a
reversal of yesterday with financials and tech on the rebound (IBM, ORCL,
HWP, SUNW, C, BAC, AXP, LEH, BSC, AMTD...) and utilities and energy falling
to profit taking (XOM, BPA, RD, WMB, PCG, CPL....).  In the CEUT Universe -
it was a mixed bag - ITWO* up over 11, MANU* (which was down over 5) closed
in the green - Catherine Moore spoke inter-day and said the sellers were
wrong..... AMCC* down almost 10, KOPN* down almost 3 1/2, PMCS* down over 2
but SSTI* up over 7.... BRCD* up over 10 1/2, NTAP* & PRCM up over 4...
MUSE* up over 4, VRTS* up over 9.... TMPW up over 3... GMH* down over 8 1/2,
XMSR* up 1/2, PGTV* down over 6 1/2... IMAN+ up almost 1...   In IPO-land
GCBF never came but UbiquiTel (UPCS), a wireless service provider associated
with Sprint PCS,  came at 8 (below original range) and closed down almost 4%
- not great but given these markets.... tomorrow is the PPI # - if shows
soft on inflation then the feeling is the Fed will not raise in June.

MSFT's Ballmer - in Europe - echoes Gates defiant stand at press conf. in

T - backing off on long dist. hikes/ also testing multiple ISPs on cable

Lou going up if Tom is involved.  However, Mark Muller is up to go and I have
spoken to him with regard to the opportunity today.  He is expecting your

On a related note, I volunteered Wes Colwell (our controller and former
Anderson person) to speak to Peoples accounting/ risk people and Anderson
auditors on how to manage the issues surrounding marking the hub values
inside Peoples.  I would appreciate you coordinating that meeting.  If Wes
goes to Chicago, we want to ensure Leubbers, the Anderson folks and the
appropriate Peoples accounting folks are available so Wes can spend the least
amount of time on this issue.

Jeff, where are we on the PECO/PSEG retail play that you spoke to Mark Muller
about a couple weeks back?

Mark, I forgot to mention that FPL is interested in potentially investing in
the New Power Company - Tony Altman (President of FPL wholesale) would like
to discuss.  If interested please call him at 561-625-7777.  If you don't
think you will have any interest let me know and I will call him to let him
know.  I probably need to get back to him either way shortly. Thanks.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Kathy, we may need Colleen Sullivan's interpretation of behind the citygate
production. Back in January, Noel Bartlo told me these deals stayed with CES
Retail. John Singer believes the deals stay with him at Enron. If these deals
stay with Enron, should they be at EES... since they are behind the citygate
or do they stay with Enron to reduce the TCO delivery to the citygates for
CES?  This could be a can of worms.

Colleen, what is the contract interruption? Does the citygate production
deals stay with Enron? If they stay with Enron, then does CES realize this?
Are the producers receiving two payments, one from Enron and one from CES.
Maybe this has already be discussed and decided, but I haven't heard the
official word.

Currently these citygate production deals are deducted from the citygate
delivery that CES needs. The numbers that Herndon LDC schedulers provide to
Enron are reduced by the production. I think Chris put these buy/sells in the
system to appease John and keep the Enron accounting system whole. Currently
the market demand tickets in Sitara are reduced by the citygate supply. The
pathing could be made easier by hooking up the citygate production supply to
the market demand tickets, but the market demand numbers need to be
increased. Then you could eliminate the buy/sell tickets that Chris Germany
has been creating.

However if this production gas is not Enron's, then Enron is creating a lot
of unnecessary work and the producers are probably receiving two payments.

John,
I am writing to you regarding the management of the London Research group.
As you know, Dale Surbey, who was managing the London unit of the Research
Group,
is moving to EBS. Dale did a terrific job helping me to develop the pool of
talent we have currently
in London.
Given that Dale is likely to be transfered to Houston,  it's time
to nominate one member of the Research Group for a management position.
My recommendation is Steve Leppard. Steve emerged not only as the most
technically qualified member of the group  but also as a natural leader,
highly
respected by his peers and internal customers.  Steve has a very high energy
level
and is very efficient as a manager and as  coach of new talent.
His promotion is likely to cause Anjam's departure form Enron. I value
technical
skills of Anjam, but in spite of my loyalty to him, don't think he is the
same caliber
as Steve. However, I would not like to lose him and think about moving him to
Houston
for 2 years. I think that the opportunity to work in Houston, would be a
sufficient
incentive to keep him in Enron. By the way, his performance feedback has
greatly improved.
Please, let me know what you think.

Jeff,
We will definitely need a lot more information related to the items below.
Please let me know when we can meet and discuss these.  Some of the items we
will need to know include:
We discussed discrepancies your team noted between the spreadsheet positions
that are being captured and what's reported on the Gas BM report.  This is
causing you to manually adjust the Gas BM report.  Is this for all
spreadsheet positions?  Some of them?  Is the variance significant?  Is it
off everyday?
What do you mean by " All Transport Models".   Does this mean positions?  Are
transport positions on the Gas BM report?  Are they manual adjustments?  Are
they in GRMS?  Can we capture these with spreadsheets?
What is your current methodology in preparing the Gas BM report for
roll-offs?  Is it currently consistent across all regions or is it handled
differently by different traders?  Please explain this in further detail. The
Basis roll-off was done in the GRMS system in the past.  Is this still the
case?  If not, we need to capture these roll-off adjustments using
spreadsheets?
Can we make the Fixed Price Canadian Deals adjustments using spreadsheets
that can be captured in GRMS?
Also, what is the status of capturing IM-Canada positions in the system?
We will need this type of information urgently.  We are meeting with Jeff
Shankman on Tuesday to update him on the progress we are making.
Please let me know if there is anything we can do to help.
Thanks,
Mike

In December I attended the Exotic Energy Derivatives conference, where I met
Masayuki Fujita from the Mitsubishi Research Institute.  He is doing research
on the deregulation of the Japanese power market.  We had lunch together and
chatted for some time about his work (I worked in a Japanese company for 8
1/2 years and speak fluent Japanese, so we got along easily).

He was in Houston this week and came by to visit.  On Monday, we met with
Vince Kaminski and Grant Masson and later had dinner with them.  Sally
suggested that I introduce him to Alan Aronowitz and you.  Of course, you
were out of town, but we did meet with Alan who said you would probably want
to meet him back in Tokyo anyway.

Would you like for me to set something up?

A young Marine and his commanding officer board a train headed through the
mountains of Switzerland. They can find no place to sit except for two
seats right across the aisle from a young woman and her grandmother.

After a while, it is obvious that the young woman and the young soldier
are interested in each other because they are giving each other "looks."

Soon, the train passes into a tunnel and it is pitch black. There is a
sound of the smack of a kiss, followed by the sound of the smack of a
slap. When the train emerges from the tunnel, the four sit there without
saying a word.

The grandmother is thinking to herself: "It was very brash for that young
soldier to kiss my granddaughter, but I'm glad she slapped him."

The commanding officer is setting there thinking: "I didn't know the young
Marine was brave enough to kiss the girl, but I sure wish she hadn't
missed him when she slapped and hit me!"

The young woman was sitting and thinking: "I'm glad the soldier kissed me,
but I wish my grandmother had not slapped him!"

The young Marine sat there with a satisfied smile on his face, thinking to
himself: "Life is good. When does a fellow have the chance to kiss a
beautiful girl and slap his commanding officer, all at the same time?"

A single man wanted someone to help him with the household

"Nah, dogs can't do dishes." The owner then suggested a cat,
but the man said, "Nah, cats can't do the ironing."

Finally the owner suggests a centipede, "This is the perfect
pet for you. It can do anything!" "OK," the man thought,
"I'll give it a try," so he bought it and took it home. Once
home he told the centipede to wash the dishes. The centipede
looks over and there are piles and piles of dirty dishes that
look to be a month old. Five minutes later, all the pots are
washed, dried, and put away. "Great," thought the man.

Now he told the centipede to do the dusting and vacuuming.
Fifteen minutes later the house is spotless. Wow, thought the
man, so he decided to try another idea. "Go down to the
corner and get me the evening paper," he told the centipede,
and off it went.

Fifteen minutes later, the centipede hadn't returned. 30
minutes later and still no centipede. Forty-five minutes and
the man was sick of waiting, so he got up and went out to
look for the centipede.

As he opened the front door, there on the step was the
centipede. "Hey, whatcha' doing there? I sent you out for the
paper 45 minutes ago and now I find you out here without the
paper! What gives?"

"Hold on a minute!" said the centipede, "I'm still putting on

Because of unique aspects of their language and culture, the Japanese
generally find it far easier to deal with each other than with foreingers.
In some Japanese, this unease can lead to some unappealing attitudes and
behaviors.

The Japanese maintain a very clear distinction between an individual's public
and private faces, so that it is rare to catch them expressing hostile views
of foreigners.  Nevertheless, every now and then, a politician's remarks will
land him in trouble.

You might find the enclosed article interesting.  By the way, Ishihara spent
two weeks denying that he had done anything wrong and only apologized in the

Ishihara acknowledges word was inappropriate

Yomiuri Shimbun

Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara late Wednesday acknowledged in a
statement
that it was "inappropriate" for him to have used the word
"sangokujin" and
said that he regrets having caused misunderstanding and
hurting foreigners in
general by using the derogatory term in a recent speech.

It was the first time that Ishihara had clearly admitted to
having hurt foreign
residents by using the word, which has discriminatory
connotations.
"Sangokujin" literally means "people from third countries."
Yet it was used
after World War II as a derisory term for people from former
Japanese
colonies, primarily Koreans, living in Japan.

On April 9, he told members of the Ground Self-Defense Forces
in Tokyo
at a ceremony, "Atrocious crimes have been committed
repeatedly by
sangokujin and (other) foreigners who have illegally entered
Japan. It is to
be expected that they will riot in the event of a major
disaster."

Although he used the word to refer to those who have
illegally entered the
country, it had a different meaning from what he meant to
say, he said.

"I did not intend to hurt Korean or other foreign residents
in Japan, and I am
extremely regretful," Ishihara said in the statement,
promising that he would
never again use the "inappropriate word," which is prone to
cause
misunderstanding.

On April 14, he expressed regret over his remarks, but
stopped short of
acknowledging the derogatory import of the word "sangokujin"
and failed to
apologize for having hurt the feelings of foreigners.

Wednesday's statement was made in response to demands from
metropolitan assembly members of Minshuto (Democratic Party
of Japan)
asking that he retract his remarks and make a public apology.

Ishihara handed the statement to senior Minshuto members of
the assembly
after they held a meeting earlier in the day.

The statement, to which Ishihara will affix the governor's
official seal, will
become an official document.

Hidejiro Kawai, secretary general of the Minshuto group
within the
assembly, said, "An official document carries weight, which
will be
tantamount to the governor's withdrawal of his remarks and
apology,"
indicating that the group will not take the matter further.

Iridium satellites may go down in flames

protection, is on the verge of one
of the most spectacular business flameouts ever--literally set to burn up
billions of dollars' worth of
Earth-orbiting assets.  Barring the last-minute arrival of a qualified
buyer, the company plans to begin
"de-orbiting" the 66 satellites that make up the world's first low-orbit
system for wireless telephone service.
That means the first global satellite telephone network--variously reported
to have cost $5 billion to $7
billion--would be vaporized as its satellites, bumped by their thrusters,
plunge from 485 miles (781 km)
above the Earth to burn up over the ocean.

E-commerce firms hip to B2B before it was hot
Business-to-business e-commerce is all the rage these days, but a few
consumer e-commerce companies such as eBay
entered the market before it was hot.   The leading auction house opened a
small-business exchange today
where companies can buy everything from computer printers to nail guns. But
the move is more of a change in marketing
than a sudden shift in focus, analysts say.  Business trades have been
quietly happening on eBay for some time, and its
format inspired many of the exchanges that have cropped up, such as
AutoExchange and Chemdex.

North Carolina Residents Debate Deregulation of Electricity

KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: High Point Enterprise - North
Carolina

Reporter (TM)



Donald Ratliffe doesn't know the intimate details over the complex debate
over whether to deregulate the sale of electricity to millions of customers
in North Carolina.
But the 57-year-old mechanic from Kernersville said he does know enough to
boil the issue down to a proverbial phrase if it ain't broke, don't fix it.



"Anytime they've seemed to deregulate something, it becomes a big mess,"
Ratliffe said, referring to the deregulation of fields such as the airline
and telephone industries. Change can be good, but it's not always good."
Answering questions recently as part of an informal survey of men and women
in the Triad, Ratliffe said the current monopoly system for electric service
suits him.
"When you think about what you get for your money, it's still a great buy,"
he said.
Ratliffe was one of the people interviewed recently by the High Point
Enterprise on their thoughts about whether the state should reform the
$8-billion-a-year electric industry. Members of the Study Commission on the
Future of Electric Service in N.C. have spent the past three years dealing
with analysts, lobbyists and industry representatives on how to approach the
intricate issue. In April, the 29-member commission approved recommendations
that include deregulating the sale of electricity starting in 2005, with full
implementation in 2006. The commission will resume its meetings in Raleigh
Sept. 14, with the goal of coming up with legislation that could be proposed
for the 2001 General Assembly session.
State legislators will have the final say on whether to deregulate an
industry that has functioned under a monopoly system for virtually a century.
The response of people answering questions posed by the Enterprise was
similar to the opinions expressed two years ago when eight public hearings
were held across the state on electric deregulation. Approximately 1,850
people attended the meetings, according to a report prepared for the
commission.
"Many people expressed serious concerns about restructuring, without
expressing a definite opinion either `for' or `against' it," reported the
consultant that prepared the commission's report on the information gathered
at the hearings.
The debate over deregulation carries special significance for High Point
because of the monumental level of municipal power debts.
The study commission hasn't come up with a specific plan to address the $5.5
billion debt. The city of High Point has municipal power debts of
approximately $430 million, the fourth-highest amount among the 51 towns and
cities in the state that run their own electric distribution systems.
Several proposals considered by the commission would compel the 51 cities and
towns to sell their power distribution systems, with the revenue going toward
debt relief.
For Avis Murphy of High Point, the topic of deregulation prompts her to
envision potential benefits and pitfalls.
The 25-year-old retail manager said having more options to pick her family's
power provider should lead to better service and prices because of
competition.
But she can also see people being taken advantage of if the government
doesn't have some oversight to prevent price gouging. Murphy suggested having
what would amount to a social safety net if deregulation takes place, such as
putting a cap on how much rates can go up during a certain period of time
among companies providing service.
Many men and women interviewed by the Enterprise said they didn't want a
deregulated electric industry to become a day-to-day telemarketing and sales
pitch drudgery.
Lou Damron of High Point and her friend enjoying lunch rolled their eyes when
asked if they would mind getting telemarketing calls from power companies as
they do now from telecommunication companies.
"Whenever they do something like this, it always gets more complicated," said
59-year-old retiree. "I like the way it is now I don't have to worry about
it."
Retiree Johnnie Alexander of High Point said that she wouldn't want
deregulation to interfere with her ability to have an equalized payment plan,
which allows her to keep her payments the same through the year.
"I like the way it is now," the 67year-old woman said.
Some people expressed an interest in deregulation if it would lead to better
prices.
Competition could be an improvement because companies would offer lower rates
to lure customers, said 69-year-old retiree John Cochran of High Point. Also,
a competitive market may compel more companies to build new power plants to
meet the demand of a growing base of customers, Cochran said.
"It always a better when there's an open marketplace," said 26-yearold
financial specialist Phillip Carter of Advance, who works in High Point. "I'm
a firm believer in capitalism and the free market."
One challenge that officials face in reforming the electric industry is the
wide disparity in the customer base and amount of electricity used per
customer in North Carolina.
Of the approximately 4 million electric customers in the state, 87 percent
are residential customers. About 12 percent are commercial customers, meaning
owners of shopping centers and office buildings, with about 1 percent
industrial customers, such as manufacturers.
However, the vast majority of electricity is used by the least number of
customers.
For example, for Carolina Power & Light Co., less than 1 percent of its
customers use 25 percent of the power that the utility generates. Put another
way, of CP&L's 1.2 million customers, the top 50 virtually all industries use
25 percent of the utility's energy, CP&L reports.
The disparity in the scope of customers and in how much electricity various
types of customers use make it challenging to come up with a competitive rate
structure where all types of customers benefit, said Charles Harman, a Duke
University mechanical engineering professor.
"What's going to happen with deregulation is that people with market clout
are going to be able to negotiate better deals than people without market
clout," said Harman, who has an expertise in electric industry issues.
That means ordinary people may find that deregulation won't have any
noticeable effect on what they pay each month to a utility, Harman said.

Earlier this week, I spoke with Bill Moore (the chief prosecutor in the
Harris County District Attorney's Special Crimes Unit) regarding the
above-referenced matter.  Mr. Moore acknowledged receiving the investigative
materials that we submitted last week, and he indicated that his office is
commencing its review of those materials.  I emphasized to Mr. Moore the
desire of EOTT's management to have this case aggressively prosecuted.  Mr.
Moore acknowledged that the aggressive prosecution of this matter would send
a strong message to other traders who might consider dishonest acts, and he
assured me that his office would vigorously pursue this matter.  Based upon
some statements made by Mr. Moore during our discussion, it was obvious that
he recalled much of the presentation from our initial meeting.  I will call
Mr. Moore again tomorrow afternoon to get an update on the progress of this
matter.
We are also attempting to obtain from Louis Dreyfus tape recordings of
Todoroff's conversations with them regarding the series of deals that we are
describing as "The Second Transaction."  If Louis Dreyfus does not
voluntarily provide us with copies of those tapes (or if they assert that
tapes do not exist), the next step will be to consider filing a lawsuit or
seeking a bill of discovery in order to obtain the tapes.  Based upon some
notes we have received from a contract administrator at Louis Dreyfus, it
appears that Louis Dreyfus also suspected or knew that something was amiss
with The Second Transaction.  Assuming that Todoroff's conversations with
Louis Dreyfus were taped, the tapes should tell us whether Todoroff had a
conspirator at Louis Dreyfus who assisted him in his scheme to defraud EOTT.
If Louis Dreyfus does not voluntarily produce tape recordings of its
conversations with Todoroff, we will need some guidance from Enron as to how
aggressive we should be in attempting to obtain the tapes.

Joe -

I spoke w/Fernley Dyson,  CAO for EE and Barry's current boss, and he's
supportive of Barry's transfer to our region to lead the
accounting/commercial support efforts for your Tokyo office.  I also spoke
with Barry, and he's excited as well.  I think it's a done deal.
Scott/Michael - I told Barry one of you would contact him tomorrow to discuss
the next steps re: a more standard expat package (not the 6 month situation -
Causey approved a more standard longer term expat arrangement), and plans to
move his family to Tokyo.

The issue we need to work out is transition, and I asked Barry to discuss
that with you directly, Joe, and I told Fernley we'd obviously be flexible
but we'd like him sooner rather than later.  Barry indicated the guy that
Fernley just hired that Barry was going to be reporting to is going to start
towards the end of April.  So I bet they're going to want some overlap there,
which puts us into end of May before Barry could really move.  I think we
should be able to accomodate this somewhat longer transition period with
Heidi's help and with Carol from Houston if necessary, plus I told Barry we'd
want him to make at least a couple of trips over to Tokyo in the interim so
he can start getting involved even before he moves over there.  But it will
be important for us to understand what specifically you want Accounting to
accomplish by the end of May so Heidi and Carol can plan how to support those
efforts while not infringing on Heidi's responsibilities and demands in
Sydney.

Meanwhile, I've asked HR to contact Eugenio Perez, Sally's designee for the
temporary Risk position, to begin those discussions, and Sally said she could
address transition issues for him next week - she'll be in London
(Scott/Michael - you should probably give her a call in the London office
their Monday afternoon).  Perhaps we can get Eugenio over to Tokyo earlier
than Barry.


Regards,
Cassandra.

Simon,

Please forward a copy of my Ken Rice presentation to Vince Kaminski.  Send
him the version with the white background.

Vince:

Thanks again for meeting with me today and I am pleased that you are
interested in discussing this opportunity in more detail.

Feel free to contact me should you have any questions.  As discussed, the
Enron Media / Advertising idea is being developed under EBS, but should
develop into its own business unit.

Enron Media / Advertising:
- Advertising Risk Book
- Physical Trades, supported by excess inventory from Cable Networks, Radio,
Network TV, etc.
- Media Buying Service
- Alliances with Advertising Agencies to sell Enron's "eyeballs" from our
customer / server - ISP relationships i.e., US West
- Agencies could endorse EBS to their customers (Ford GM, Procter & Gamble,
etc.) and become an Extended Enterprise for EBS and our EIN applications
- Enron's Capital, to fund Content Development for the networks and
Hollywood, which in turn would provide content for our pipes with licensing
and syndication rights.
- An Enron On Line B to B opportunity (You may want to review the following
sites: DoubleClick.com, Agency.com, AdAuction.com)

Mark and Kal:

Vince and I are meeting on Tuesday, March 28th @ 3:00 PM to further discuss
the development of the Enron Media /Advertising concept .  Can you join us to
provide a Customer and Agency perspective?

Regards,
Michael P. Horning

Here's the deal--I just talked to my guy out in Kennebec S.D. and got a
glowing report on the situation.  His opening day group is down to 6 guys so
he is only giving them access to half of his fields--we get first shot at the
rest.  He's got so many pheasants he's worried about us limiting out to fast
and getting mad.    I assured him that the way we all shoot that wouldn't be
a problem.
When:  Friday-Sunday, Oct. 27-29.
Where:  Kenebec S.D.  (about 2 hours east of Rapid City, about 5 hours from
Omaha)
$$:   $75 per guy per day if we have at least 8 guys.   If we dwindle to less
than 8, its $100 per guy.  (he will cut us some slack on this if some of you
can only hunt 2 days.)
Fish:  Walleye fish fry on Sat. PM included
Lodging :  Super 8 in Chamberlain--about 30 miles away if the weather is
cold, possible camping in Kennebec if people are up for it.  Super 8 is a
lovely place:  motto is "Labs sleep free."  $100 per night, 4 guys per room+
$25/head/night.
So far, I think we've got 5 or 6 guys locked in solid. Another 6 or 8 have
been invited but are obtaining spousal consent.   I'd like to get 10 locked
in solid by end of Sept.  More than that would make the hunting a little
clumsy.  Bay, my wife says you can't come because your new kid is due around
this time.  What a lame excuse!!  You were there for the first 4, right?
Doesn't a guy deserve a bye eventually?  If you guys have anyone else that's
interested other than the folks that have already been invited, let me know
as we may want to invite a few more just to make sure we have around 10.
Talk to you.  DF

This is what transpired on yesterday's conference call regarding
Edison's legislative proposal:

Participants: NEV, Green Mountain, Utility.com, TURN, Reliant, Don
Fields

Rick Counnihan met with Edison and John White to discuss the proposal.
Edison discussed four issues which they would like to link to the public
goods charge extension which I have listed below.  These issues differ
from the original issues which Edison said we all took out of context.
According to Rick, John didn,t say much other than he wants to establish
emission standards for DG.

Public Goods Extension ) Edison would like to extend the charge but
change how money is allocated.

Maintain Wire Franchise ) Edison would like to own, operate and plan the
distribution system.  They believe there should be charges associated
with this, perhaps non-bypassable, but that that should be worked out by
the CPUC.  They also indicated that the utilities should no longer own
DG systems.

Procurement Charges ) Edison would like to procure energy wholesale from
a variety of sources, including the PX, and distribute with no mark-up
to their customers.

Revenue Cycle Services ) Edison believes the metering/billing area is
too contentious and they will not address it.  This does not mean the
unions won,t address it in exchange for supporting the public goods
extension which they oppose.

Edison said PG&E may want help with the irrigation districts who are
encroaching on their distribution system in exchange for support.  No
word on Sempra.  Edison was also confident that they could kill an
extension because so many people have problems with it including Rod
Wright
and the unions.

With respect to the coalition, it was agreed that each entity would
continue to take meetings and discuss the issue from their prospective.
We,d like to do so with John,s supprt but Rick will have to check with
him first.  We plan on having another conference call on Monday, March
13 at 4pm.

Along with my conversations about the Calvert City projects, I also spoke to
Paul Burdick about the following:

1.  Putting a peaker expansion at AES's announced Sayreville, N.J. plant.  He
indicated that they would be interested but that there was an issue with
transmission cue spots.  I asked if there was a certain maximum size that
would allow for a quick interconnection.  He was going to check?  Do we know
of any exceptions?

2.  I mentioned that we were developing a market based LD insurance product
to Paul.  I walked him through the basics of mark-to-market accounting.  He
was extremely interested.  He says that they have 4 tolling agreements that
they would be interested in applying the product to (I believe that the
agreements are all with Williams;  one of the agreements I believe already
calls for market based LDs).  I told him that we would organize a
presentation shortly.

If Scott Yeager can make it, he will do his magic via quick motivational
speech on the vision of EBS, etc..

It is will be strictly Technical to Technical professional meeting to get to
know each others group. So, do not include others unles Stinson or I look at
the additions case-by-case.

John suggested Scott Yeager's summar house in Denver for this event.  Please
follow this up with Scott's assistant (Scott may not know about this if John
has not told him so you should explain the intend, etc.) to get in touch with
Scott.  I'll cc this e-mail to give Scott a heads up.

We can do half day friday and all day saturday. Or, we can do the whole
weekend and people will have an option to bring family to nearby hotel
(family expense in NOT on EBS). We will have to sort all this out when we
have a chance to talk to John & Scott.

I just wanted to get the ball rolling but getting dates and place first.

Thanks,

Ravi.

Bruno --
We should contact Mike Day as soon as possible and have him prepared to draft
legislative fixes for any bill that would come out looking like the Wood
Draft Decision consistent with the issues you outlined below.  I want to make
sure that we are prepared for this possibility.
FYI, given the information I have, the Wood Draft Decision is more favorable
for Enron's attempt at becoming the wholesale supplier to SDG&E.  It looks
pretty tough to beat the Duque Decision.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Dear David,

I'm so glad you asked for an update!

We have indeed had an interesting development regarding the Electricity Bill
since your visit.  You will recall that in AMCHAM's briefing, it was
positively noted that the drafting process of the Electricity Bill had been
transparent and that a draft that would provide a blueprint for the
restructuring of the electricity sector to move toward competitive markets
was attained.  Noone was 100 percent satisfied (probably the mark of a good,
passable bill) but many  agreed to the draft and felt, while not perfect, it
would achieve the desired reform.

We have learned that there are actually two drafts of the Electricity Bill
sponsored by the Ministry of Power.  The first has been developed by NCAER
(NCAER draft) in a very transparent process with seven iterations and
comments from 190 parties.  NCAER was hired as a consultant for this purpose
by the Ministry of Power.  At the time of Draft III, a second draft (MoP
draft) was developed in the Ministry which subsequently incorporated some but
not all of the NCAER draft provisions negotiated in the transparent process.
It was the MoP draft that was sent to the Group of Ministers and has been
worked on by the Ministry of Law.

The draft, however, was never introduced in Parliament.  The industry
discovered the existence of the second MoP draft immediately prior to
Minister Kumaramangalam's hospitalization and lobbied him and Secretary Basu
heavily to introduce the NCAER draft in Parliament or, at a minimum, allow a
transparent commenting process on the MoP draft.

Several parties in the industry have now been given the MoP draft, and
Secretary Basu has said he would entertain comments.  (How widely it has been
distributed is unknown.)  In addition, the death of the Minister, who was a
staunch advocate of reform, and the lack of a named successor, has now left
things somewhat uncertain.

The issues as they now stand are:

The existence of two separate Ministry-sponsored drafts, only one of which
was subjected to a wide sector review process.
The need to use the product of a transparent, commenting process once it has
been formulated.
The fact that the fine-tuned balance of interests and clear blueprint for a
transition to competitive markets achieved by the NCAER draft has been lost
in the MoP draft.  For example, the clear deregulation of price provisions in
the tariff section have been removed so that there is, in the MoP draft, full
regulation of price by the state commissions; however, in the state
commission section, there is a provision that allows the State Commission to
permit access to a consumer class and only determine the wheeling charge
(rather than the wheeling and supply price) for that class when it has so
determined.   Thus, there is  an apparent conflict within the statute
regarding the regulation of commodity priceand uncertainty regarding access
to end users.  (There are many such examples.)

Action Item:  Either support the NCAER draft and send it to the Ministry of
Law for legal fine tuning (Basu mentioned that the "form" of the NCAER draft
was not right), or repeat the iterative, transparent commenting process with
regard to the MoP draft.  hWe recommend supporting the NCAER draft because it
reflects a balance of the multiple sector interests.  It is the first such
document produced through an open process in India and was a process
sponsored by the Ministry -- for that reason alone, the Ministry should
promote and support the NCAER version.

Any assistance you can render on this issue will be greatly appreciated by
many parties in the sector.  Let us know how it goes.

Sincerely,
Jane Wilson

have CSFB come in for trainng.
At the same time we can complete the clearing agreement.
We will not do the give up agreement.  If we decide we can do easily in the
future.
Guillaume suggested that you call him if you have any questions.  He will be

Good seeing you again.  As I mentioned yesterday, I am sending you a copy of
the Conservation Easement that has been granted to Cal Dept of Fish and Game
over the NCL property.  I would appreciate if you could get a copy to John
Schaefer (I couldn't find him in the Enron directory).

As you will see, the Conservation Easement references the State Endangered
Species Take Permit I gave you previously, so the two should be read in
conjuction.  Also, I wanted to let you and whoever in environmental ends up
servicing the assets out here two other things:  first, Kenny Maltby of ETS
Bakersfield is our designated "representative responsible for communications
with the Department and for overseeing compliance with th[e Take permit]", as
specified in section 5.1 of the permit.  (Kenny and I are really the only
personnel in California who are aware of the Permit and its requirements.)

Second, various sections of the permit require use of " a knowledgeable,
experienced biologist."   (See e.g., Section 5.4.)  We have been using a
biologist in Bakersfield, Randi McCormick, for this purpose for years.  I
strongly urge we continue to use her because she knows our operations, knows
our people, knows our contractors, knows our habitat, knows our permit
conditions, has good relations/credibility  with Cal. Fish and Game and US
Fish and Wildlife, and has always been reasonable with and responsive to us.
I would like to get her on a contract wth ETS.

Lastly, I am getting more eager to see and discuss the results of the audit
now after your statements regarding the credibility of the sampling in the
1997 "baseline" study done by WZI.  (It's a very interesting issue for many
reasons, which I'll spare going into here; obviously, the crux of my concern
is that it may not be much of a baseline at all.)  So, I would like to have
some input into the question of how "resampling" would be done, if possible,
because of the Koch indemnification issues presented.  So please be sure that
your enviro folks remember our EOTT company motto: "Call Before you Dig!"

Again, good seeing you and the crew, and I look forward to talking about
these and other issues again real soon.  In particular, if there's any other
info i can get your enviro folks that they'd find helpful, please let me
know. --ETA

For those who did not have time to watch the third and final presidential
debate Tuesday night, I've prepared this transcript of what was said:

Jim Lehrer:
Welcome to the third presidential debate between Vice President Al Gore and
Gov.  George W.  Bush. The candidates have agreed on these rules: I will ask
a question.  The candidate will ignore the question and deliver rehearsed
remarks designed to appeal to undecided women voters.  The opponent will
then have one minute to respond by trying to frighten senior citizens into
voting for him. When a speaker's time has expired, I will whimper softly
while he continues to spew incomprehensible statistics for three more
minutes.

Let's start with the vice president.  Mr.  Gore, can you give us the name of
a downtrodden citizen and then tell us his or her story in a way that
strains the bounds of common sense?

Gore:
As I was saying to Tipper last night after we tenderly made love the way we
have so often during the 30 years of our rock-solid marriage, the
downtrodden have a clear choice in this election.  My opponent wants to cut
taxes for the richest 1 percent of Americans.  I, on the other hand, want to
put the richest 1 percent in an ironclad lockbox so they can't
hurt old people like Roberta Frampinhamper, who is here tonight.  Mrs.
Frampinhamper has been selling her internal organs, one by one, to pay for
gas so that she can travel to these debates and personify problems for me.
Also, her poodle has arthritis.

Lehrer:
Gov.  Bush, your rebuttal.

Bush:
Governors are on the front lines every day, hugging people, crying with
them, relieving suffering anywhere a photo opportunity exists.  I want to
empower those crying people to make their own decisions, unlike my opponent,
whose mother is not Barbara Bush.

Lehrer:
Let's turn to foreign affairs.  Gov.  Bush, if Slobodan Milosevic were to
launch a bid to return to power in Yugoslavia, would you be able to
pronounce his name?

Bush:
The current administration had eight years to deal with that guy and
didn't get it done. If I'm elected, the first thing I would do about that
guy is have Dick Cheney confer with our allies.  And then Dick would present
me several options for dealing with that guy.  And then Dick would tell me
which one to choose.  You know, as governor of Texas, I have to make tough
foreign policy decisions every day about how we're going to deal with New
Mexico.

Lehrer:
Mr.  Gore, your rebuttal.

Gore:
Foreign policy is something I've always been keenly interested in. I
served my country in Vietnam.  I had an uncle who was a victim of poison gas
in World War I.  I myself lost a leg in the Franco-Prussian War.  And when
that war was over, I came home and tenderly made love to Tipper in a way
that any undecided woman
voter would find romantic.
If I'm entrusted with the office of president, I pledge to deal
knowledgeably with any threat, foreign or domestic, by putting it in an
ironclad lockbox.  Because the American people deserve a president who can
comfort them with simple metaphors.

Lehrer:
Vice President Gore, how would you reform the Social Security system?

Gore: It's a vital issue, Jim.  That's why Joe Lieberman and I have proposed
changing the laws of mathematics to allow us to give $50,000 to every senior
citizen without having it cost the federal treasury a single penny until the
year 2250.  In addition, my budget commits $60 trillion over the  next 10
years to guarantee that all senior citizens can have drugs delivered free to
their homes every Monday by a federal employee who will also help them with
the child-proof cap.

Lehrer:
Gov.  Bush?

Bush:
That's fuzzy math.  I know, because as governor of Texas, I have to do
math every day.  I have to add up the numbers and decide whether I'm going
to fill potholes out on Rt.  36 east of Abilene or commit funds to reroof
the sheep barn at the Texas state fairgrounds.

Lehrer:
It's time for closing statements.

Gore:
I'm my own man.  I may not be the most exciting politician, but I will
fight for the working families of America, in addition to turning the
White House into a lusty pit of marital love for Tipper and me.

Bush:
It's time to put aside the partisanship of the past by electing no one but
Republicans.

Lehrer:
Good night.

Here is a summary of recent developments:

Another Class Action Natural Gas Complaint Against El Paso and others (Los
Angeles)
Berg v. Southern California Gas Company. Class action anti-trust and
unfair competition.   This is a conspiracy case alleging that the Southern
California Gas, SDGE and El Paso  conspired not to compete in the
delivery of natural gas in Southern California.  The  complaint alleges
that the conspiracy resulted in discouraging new power plants and drove
up the cost of electricity by controlling the supply of gas.

<<Rojoin.cmplt.PDF>>
California AG Investigation
Here is a copy of my email to the California AG describing our
agreement re preservation of data:
Rich,
As promised, here is my summary outline of what we discussed
regarding preservation of data:

1. In Portland, we proposed to handle business email related to the
topics in your preservation letter by instructing employees not to delete
any email sent or received for 24 hours.  Email that is personal and does
not relate to the business topics you have identified can be kept, discarded
etc. at the employee's pleasure.  Each day there is a backup made that will
capture the email in those employees mailboxes.  After 24 hours, each
employee is free to manage their email box as they deem appropriate to the
business needs (e.g. keep, discard).  From our conversation, I understand
that you agree that this is an acceptable procedure.

2. With respect to the hard drives on individual computers, you would
like to get an organizational chart for Portland that would enable us to
discuss 6-12 individual's computers that would be copied using ProQuest
Drive Image Pro 4.0.  In addition, there may be some other individuals that
you would like to have us use a software product called Robocopy to copy
files from their hard drives onto the network.  Until we figure out which
computers to copy etc. we will not begin this process.  We discussed that
because of the holiday period, it may not be practical to get this started
until after the new year.

3. Outside of Portland, we have proposed making a snapshot backup along
business function lines reasonably called for by the subject matter of your
request.  We propose not to backup any other business units or functions.
On a going forward basis, those business functions that related to the
subject matter of your request would be instructed not to delete business
email.

4. We believe that relevant database  backups have been and will
continue to be made and preserved.

5. When an employee runs out of hard disk space on their computer, it
is an acceptable practice to copy files form their hard disk to the network
(where they will be backed up) and then delete those copied files to make
sufficient work space for the employee to work.

6. For EES, I explained that their IT services are outsourced so we do
not have as detailed information immediately available.

As I mentioned on the phone, all of these discussions and efforts being made
are done without waiving any objections that any of the Enron entities may
have to your request including scope, burden, jurisdiction, relevance,
privilege, privacy, vagueness etc. and Enron specifically reserves each and
every right and objection it or its employees may have.

Please let me know if your general understanding of our conversation is
different than the above.
CPUC Subpoena
Jeff Richter and Tim Belden have been working on getting the EPMI
data correctly gathered.  They hope that by the middle of next week the
Enron technical types will have figured out where all the data is and have
assembled it for production.  Because Jeff Richter will be gone until after
the New Year, we will not be producing any data to the CPUC until early next
year.
Jeff and Tim are focused on having a common set of reliable data
that will be used for all subpoenas, discovery requests etc.  We also
discussed once we have the data collected that we use one of our experts to
help with the analysis so that we are not creating files and records for
which we will need to claim a privilege at a later point in time.  In other
words, since we are keeping the backup tapes for the systems in Portland any
analytical work that Tim or Jeff do for us will be recorded on the backup
tapes.
Tim Belden
FYI Tim and his wife are expecting their first child with a due date
of December 25th.  He will become out of pocket for a short time thereafter.
FERC Reporting
A question arose regarding whether Enron needed to file a report to
FERC concerning sales out of market that exceeded the soft caps.  This was a
requirement that was requested by the ISO in an emergency application on
December 8th.  The order granting the relief did not seem to include the
reporting requirement.  The first cut at the data for the report showed that
Enron made $1.0M over a weekend by buying power at $500 and selling at $700.
A later cut at the data came up with a different answer.  When consulted by
Christian Yoder and Steve Hall, I made the unilateral decision not to file
the report.  It was unclear whether we needed to do so and I had not seen
and did not trust the data.  Later Dan Watkiss confirmed that he believed we
did not need to file the report.  However, beginning January 12th this
report will have to be filed for sales over the soft cap.  Since this report
requires a breakdown of costs vs. sales price, it is the same data that the
PUC has been requesting and we anticipate will be requested in the
litigation.  Tim Belden and Jeff Richter are working on a standard reporting
method.
Hiring of Chief Operating Officer for ISO
Tim Belden has been approached by the current Chief Operating
officer of the ISO requesting a job.  Apparently the COO and the current ISO
board are not getting along.  The issue raised by Tim to Mark Haedicke and
Richard was whether they saw a problem with this hire.  One of the key
issues would be what was the business purpose for the hire.  Obviously,
Enron does not want confidential ISO information from this person.  Also, if
this person will be a witness in the litigation there is a risk that if his
testimony would be favorable to Enron it would be viewed as purchased.  On
the other hand if his testimony would not be favorable at a time when he was
employed by Enron that could be harmful.  There is also the question raised
whether this is a bona fide request for employment or whether other motives
could be in play.  Tim will be meeting with the COO on Friday.  He has
instructions to make sure that he is not given any confidential data and
that no commitment will be made then without consulting the litigation team.
Potential for Criminal Investigation
The news of the investigation and all of our involvement has raised
questions in the mind of some employees as to whether there is a risk of
personal liability for them (civil or criminal).  I reported that all we
know is that there is an investigation under way by the California Attorney
General.  We have no reason to believe right now that they are focused on
Enron or that Enron or any employee is a target.  I said that at this stage
of the investigation (including our investigation) we do not know enough
facts to evaluate the risk for individual employees.  We have not reviewed
the trader tapes to know what has been said on those tapes.  If we learn of
facts that are specific to an employee, Mark has asked that we notify him
immediately.  We did provide some of this same information to traders we
interviewed early in the process.
Analysis of EPMI data
I have taken a look at the deviation of the ISO energy flow on a
daily basis from its day ahead schedules and compared those deviations to
EPMI's.  The source of the data is public information that was available to
decision makers at the time.  The comparison shows that generally speaking
the ISO was short in its projection by a magnitude of 5-10 times the amount
that EPMI was out of balance.  There are some exceptions, but those are
rare.
Approaching Federal Judge for More Time
Dave Noonan has pointed out that we should look carefully at the
assigned federal judge and decide who from the defense group locally in San
Diego would be in the best position to make the motion.
Holiday Contact List
Dave Noonan suggested and I concurred that it makes sense for all of
you who receive this report to email me with your contact information and
schedule over the holiday period.  I will have a composite list made up and
distributed.

Thanks
Gary

It's do-or-die for Longhorns

Oct. 12, 2000

[IMAGE]Chip Brown, who covers Texas football for The Dallas Morning News,
answers your questions about rebounding from the Oklahoma loss, Major
Applewhite as the sole starter, promotions for Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson
and more. Inside Texas Football appears each Thursday.

E-mail questions to Chip: chipbrown@dallasnews.com

Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on
DallasNews.com's Colleges site



Chip Shot


This week, Texas faces the man whom UT officials considered a finalist for
the Longhorns' coaching job awarded to Mack Brown. The Longhorns travel to
Boulder, Colo., and meet Gary Barnett's Buffaloes.

No team has ever beaten Texas seven straight times. But that's exactly what
the Buffaloes will be trying to do this week. Colorado has won six straight
against UT dating to 1989. Texas last beat Colorado in the 1975 Bluebonnet
Bowl, and hasn't won in Boulder since 1941.

Two of the last three UT-CU games have been decided on the final drives. The
Buffs won on a final-play field goal in Austin in 1994, and the Longhorns'
Hail Mary pass fell incomplete in a 28-24 loss in Boulder in 1996.

Here are some comments from Barnett in his weekly news conference:

On the play of his team in its first victory of the season over Texas A&M:
"The play of our offensive line was the most dominant we've had. I felt like
the line and all the kids really cut it loose for the first time this season.
We were a much more focused team."

On Texas: "Texas is the most talented team we'll face this year, maybe in a
couple years. They are loaded with talent on both sides of the ball, and they
have depth. You've got to think after their loss (to Oklahoma), they will
come in here really inspired. It should be a good matchup. The obvious
challenge for us is to hold up defensively against their passing game."

On Mack Brown: "What I've been most impressed with Mack is his ability to get
players. He's forced the hand of a lot of players and gotten commitments
early. They have been able to hand-pick the players they want out of Texas.
When you can get Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas in the same
class, something is going on. Something good. We recruited all of those
players. The hype around Simms had something to do with it, too. Receivers
want to play with a good quarterback."


Longhorn Q & A
Q:What's the deal with the QB rotation this week? And were there any other
promotions to the starting lineup?
Marge Ringer

BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on
Tuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a
"need-to-win" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is no
plan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the
offense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive
coordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB
rotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other
promotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and Roy
Williams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches made
these promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take
more of a vocal leadership role. And coaches said freshman tight end Brock
Edwards might see more playing time, and running back Kenny Hayter will see
more carries than the two he had against OU last week.







[IMAGE]
Kenny Hayter

Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a bigger
running back during first and second down to increase their chances at a
third-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-down
back who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a
guy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on
first and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as
well, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and
long  situations due to not

picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion, is a
more physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in there
on first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in
Hodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands and
is a reliable blocker.
Eric Barker, Plano, Texas

BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game
became a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in the
second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said he
was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw
and score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice this
week, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.



Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game?
Lance Kyles

BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed to
bring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to next
year's OU game.



Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get
pressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?
Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?
Cody Anderson, Houston

BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The running
game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT was
forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot of
time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and because
he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this
week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference,
but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Rogers
was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,
according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the
defense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like
running backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for big
yards.



Q:I began following Longhorn football when I arrived at UT in  1995, and no
one was more shocked than me when the alumni and DeLoss Dodds  turned on John
Mackovic so viciously after the loss to UCLA in 1997. Not only was I appalled
at the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that  this was par for
the course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly
embraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm  worried we are
about to see a repeat of history. What do you think?
Lisa Davis, Austin

BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around
Austin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive
coordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond
after being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that this
game with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,
the Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart in
order to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are really
in the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the
chances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas State
and at Texas Aare slim. The chances are good the Sooners will emerge with at
least two losses in those games. Texas can get right back in the race with a
win Saturday. If the Longhorns do win and UT looks good with Major Applewhite
at QB, then everyone will say "I told you so, Mack" regarding the QB rotation
having slowed down UT's offense all season. But the critical fans will also
embrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but
they will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for
the rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.
He'll be around Texas for a good while.

Casey Hampton

Q:I know I have no right to criticize coaching because I don't have any idea
what I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that
after a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said  numerous
times that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'  inconsistency,
and most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern  UT seems to
follow amazes me. Every few games, everything just blows up and  we are
embarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage  to screw
up horribly in random

games? My only thought is that it has to be  the coaching. It's not like the
players aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter  proves in the OSU game to be the
solution to the running game's problem.  Why replace him the next weekend in
a much bigger game with the truly  hard-working, but honestly inefficient
Hodges Mitchell? Why run the ball  over and over when it obviously doesn't
work? Or it could work, if the  right players were in... These things baffle
me. Do you think the coaching  is one of the problems? What can be done to
fix the inconsistencies that  are actually becoming consistent and developing
a pattern of embarrassing  losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then
the last three awful  games. This year, it's  mediocre Stanford, and the good
but not THAT good  OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.
David Rowe, Austin

BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma got
it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in to
slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanche
was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense.
Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I
believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and the
offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has no
vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. But
none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an
ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about whether
he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.
Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You
can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is
inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey
Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trahan
needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to
step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.



Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to have
the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new
wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is
coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the
play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On
defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and
the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the same
blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis
seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mistake
or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some
excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on the
sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU
with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,
especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and
tendencies also?
Todd Purl

BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating his
play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas has
done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said just
using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50
with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line
can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of being
balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up the
run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the
coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten
after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives.



Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- be
realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and
losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has
said "the other team just wanted it more" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges
Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas and
Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? Or
is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might
for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc.
Mike Engelman

BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very telling.
When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 under
the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams
like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A(1998) and won. But now that Texas
is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though
Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure
there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with
everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiting
star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will be
expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So he
has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when the
Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have
all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT
had to beat them - Texas A(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (had
been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cotton
Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT
in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hope
of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over
Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and make
his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership
among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or
constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.







[IMAGE]
Greg Davis

Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were
thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is
the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are
offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the
better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last
seven games (including this one) we have played against "good" defenses
(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible.
We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank

54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in the
country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th in
the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly
conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below average
when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much
credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failure
to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on
this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter was
on Saturday!  Thanks,
Lane

BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bit
more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down,
and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin
there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being
yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where
plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the
tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense
anymore.



Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, no-
huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come
alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Major
Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford,
the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense
did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then
when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why
not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I
believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we all
would  love to see a consistent running game.
Brian Gannon

BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: "The
one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo because
it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against
using it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosophy
of being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass."


Q:The OU game was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish with no
redeeming features  whatsoever which sets the program back at least a year,
if not more. So tell us something good, Chip ... PLEASE!
Rowell Rogers, Denton

BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the driver's
seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas
doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear
hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. For
every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fall
into place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects of
the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. If
UT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedule
to get to the Agame with only one league loss. Let's see what happens.



Q:You stated that every QB would benefit from a redshirt year unless they
were Michael Vick. Michael Vick redshirted at Virginia Tech and benefited
greatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it
last year.
Brad Livingston

BROWN: I stand corrected. But even in my error, I proved my point. I said all
freshmen benefit from a redshirt year, and Chris Simms probably would have,
too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for
setting the record straight.



Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the
receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely
coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but
Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run
on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance
to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and
opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surely
if Simms lives up to his pedigree as everyone hopes, he wouldn't have his
feelings hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to him.
Brandon May

BROWN: Simms said this week that if the coaches went solely with Applewhite,
he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has
been pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his
play. He said the grade he would give himself this season would be terrible.
But he says, in his heart, he believes he will show everyone the promise that
has been expected of him since leaving high school as the nation's top QB
prospect.



Q:What role is Courtnee Garcia playing this year on the football team? Is
Miguel McKay on the football team?
Poorun Patel, Lufkin

BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the
pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And
he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behind
Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince
the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make the
most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's
position) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the
team and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU.



Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting
restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recruits
that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4
years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered up
by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the
next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive
tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where
the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would
guess that it has something to do with getting "senior" performance from
underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I
don't know. What do you think?
Kevin P. McCarthy

BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with the
schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without
losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star
high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 from
then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 10
and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving
corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the
O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have
all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will lose
two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcus
Tubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership
in other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors.



Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the
offense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland
Owls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's
semi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final
game. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams?
Tyrance "Duke" Barnett, Garland, Texas

BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importantly,
their leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack
Brown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to be
and play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be
outstanding, in my opinion.



Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the QB
situation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of the
most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my
opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps
in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can
say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would
not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the
entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to the
level they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB
controversy creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved. The
coaches, media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity, all
the while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to prove
he should be the starter. Mack Brown's job is to be above that, and it's time
for him to take the heat. The media and fans are touching on this, but I
think it's time to tell it like it is with his illogical, failed and unfair
experiment.
Jason Stone

BROWN: Amen, Jason. You have spoken, and the rotation has come to an end. At
least for this week.



Q:Is there a start time for the Missouri game on Oct. 21?


BROWN: Not yet. ABC has opted to use its 6-day window to determine which
games it will televise that weekend. Right now, it's possible that the game
could be at 2:30 p.m., 6 p.m. or 1 p.m. It definitely will not be at 11 a.m.
Stay tuned.

This is worth the time it takes to read.
Happy Holidays everyone,

Subject: Bush's Testimony


The founder of the (web?)site said he called
Gore and  Bush  andasked them to send in their
testimonies for the web site-since they BOTH
"claim" to be Christians.
Gore's office said that he didn't have one in
typed  form - but Bush did.
Here it is...please pass this along!
Very Important!!! This could change America.
(Whether Democrat or Republican)
If any of you are interested in what George Bush
says about his faith, here it is.
(Alex Mooney, State Senator)
From George W. Bush:
"Actually, the seeds of my decision had been
planted  the year before, by the Reverend Billy Graham.
He visited my family for a summer weekend in Maine.
I saw him preach at the small summer church,
St. Ann's by the Sea.  We all had lunch on the patio
overlooking theocean. One evening my dad asked Billy
to answer questions from a big group of family
gathered for the weekend. He sat by the fire and
talked.
And what he said sparked a change in my heart. I
don't remember the exact words. It was more the power of
his example. The Lord was so clearly reflected in his
gentle and loving demeanor. The next day we walked
and talked at Walker's Point, and I knew I was in the
presence of a great man.  He was like a magnet; I  felt
drawn to seeksomething different. He didn't lecture
or admonish; he shared warmth and concern. Billy Graham
didn't make you feel guilty;  he made you feel  loved.
Over the course of that weekend, Reverend Graham
planted a mustard seed in  mysoul, a seed that grew
over the next year. He  led me to the path, and I  began
walking.
It was the beginning of a change in my life. I had
always been a "religious" person, had regularly
attended church, even taught Sunday School.
But that weekend my faith took on a new meaning. It
was the beginning of a new walk where I would commit
my heart to Jesus Christ.
I was humbled to learn that God sent His Son to
die for a sinner like me. I was comforted to know that
through the Son, I could find God's amazing grace,
a grace that crosses every border, every barrier and
is open to everyone.
Through the love of Christ's life, I could understand
the life changing powers of faith.
When I returned to Midland, I began reading the
Bible regularly.  Don Evans  talked me into joining him
and another friend, Don Jones, at a men's community
Bible study. The group had first assembled the year before,
in Spring of 1984, at the beginning of the downturn in the
energy industry.   Midland was hurting. A lot of people
were looking for comfort and strength and direction.
A couple of men started  the Bible study as a support group,
and it grew. By the time I began attending, in the fall of
1985, almost 120 men would gather. We met in small
discussion groups of ten or twelve, then joined the
larger group for full meetings.
Don Jones picked me up every week for the meetings.
I remember looking forward to them. My interest in
reading the Bible grew stronger and stronger,
and the words became clearer and more meaningful.
We studied Acts, the story of the Apostles building the
Christian Church, and next year, the Gospel of Luke. The
preparation for each meeting took several hours,
reading the Scripture passages and thinking through
responses to discussion questions. I took it seriously,
with my usual touch of humor....Laura and I were active
members of the First Methodist Church of Midland,
and we participated in many family programs,including
James Dobson's Focus on the Family series on raising children.
As I studied and learned, Scripture took on greater meaning,
and gained confidence and understanding in my faith.
I read the Bible regularly.  Don Evans gave me the
"one-year" Bible, a Bible divided into 365 daily readings,
each one including a section from the New Testament, the Old
Testament, Psalms, and Proverbs. I read through that Bible \
every other year. During the years in between, I pick
different chapters to study at different times.
I have also learned the power of prayer. I pray for
guidance. I do not pray for earthly things, but for
heavenly things,for wisdom and patience and understanding.
My faith gives me focus and perspective.It teaches humility.
But I also recognize that faith can be misinterpreted in
the political process. Faith is an important part
of my life. I believe it is important to live my faith,
not flaunt it.
America is a great country because of our religious
freedoms. It is important for any leader to respect
the faith of others. That point was driven home when
Laura and I visited Israel in 1998. We had traveled to
Rome to spend Thanksgiving with our daughter, who was
attending a school program there, and spent three days in
Israel on the way home. It was an incredible experience.
I remember waking up at the Jerusalem Hilton and opening
the curtains and seeing the Old City before us,
the Jerusalem stone glowing gold. We visited the \
Western Wall and the Church of the Holy Sepulcher.
And we went to the Sea of Galilee and stood atop the
hill where Jesus delivered the Sermon on the Mount.
It was an overwhelming feeling to stand in the spot
where the most famous speech in the history of the world
was delivered, the spot where Jesus outlined the
character and conduct of a believer and gave
his disciples and the world the beatitudes, the
golden rule, and the Lord's Prayer.
Our delegation included four gentile governors,
one Methodist, two Catholics, and a Mormon, and several
Jewish-American friends. Someone suggested we read
Scripture. I chose to read "Amazing Grace," my favorite
hymn. Later that night we all gathered at a
restaurant in Tel Aviv for dinner before we boarded
our middle-of-night flight back to America. We talked
about the wonderful experiences and thanked the guides
and government officials who had introduced us to
their country.
And toward the end of the meal, one of our friends
rose to share a story, to tell us how he, a gentile, and
his friend, a Jew, had (unbeknownst to the rest of us)
walked down to the Sea of Galilee,joined hands underwater,
and prayed together, on bended knee.
Then out of his mouth came a hymn he had known as
a child, a hymn he hadn't thought about in years.
He got every word right:
Now is the time approaching,
by prophets long foretold,
when all shall dwell together,
One Shepherd and one fold.
Now Jew and gentile, meeting,
from many a distant shore,
around an altar kneeling,
one common Lord.

Faith changes lives. I know, because faith has
changed mine." Icould not be governor if I did not
believe in a divine plan that supersedes all human
plans. Politics is a fickle business. Polls change.
Today's friend is tomorrow's adversary. People lavish
praise and attention. Many times it is genuine;
sometimes it is not. Yet I build my life on a
foundation that will not shift. My faith frees me.
Frees me to put the problem of the moment in proper
perspective. Frees me to make decisions that others
might not like. Frees me to try to do the right
thing, even though it may not poll well...
The death penalty is a difficult issue for supporters
as well as its opponents.
I have a reverence for life; my faith teaches that
life is a gift from our Creator. In a perfect world, life
is given by God and only taken by God. I hope someday
our society will respect life, the full spectrum of life,
from the unborn to the elderly. I hope someday unborn
children will be protected by law and welcomed in life.
I support the death penalty because I believe,
if administered swiftly and justly, capital punishment is a
deterrent against future violence and will save
other innocent lives. Some advocates of life will
challenge why I oppose abortion yet support the
death penalty.  To me, it's the difference between
innocence andguilt.
Today, two weeks after Jeb's inauguration, in my
church in downtown Austin, Pastor Mark Craig,
was telling me that my re-election was the first
Governor to win back-to-back, four-year terms in
the history of theState of Texas.
It was a beginning, not an end.... People are starved
for faithfulness. He talked of the need for honesty in
government. He warned that leaders who cheat on their
wives will cheat their country, will cheat
their colleagues, will cheat themselves.
Pastor Craig said that America is starved for
honest leaders. He told the story of Moses,
asked by God to lead his people to a land of
milk and honey.  Moses had a lot of reasons to
shirk the task. As the Pastor told it, Moses'
basic reaction was, "Sorry, God, I'm busy. I've got a
family. I've got sheep to tend. I've got a life.
"Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh, and bring
the sons of Israel out of Egypt? The people won't
believe me, he protested.  I'm not a very good
speaker. Oh, my Lord, send, I pray, some other person,
"Moses pleaded. But God did not, and Moses ultimately
did His bidding, leading his people through forty
years of wilderness and wandering, relying on God for
strength and direction and inspiration.
"People are starved for leadership, "Pastor Craig
said, "starved for leaders who have ethical and moral
courage." "It is not enough to have an ethical
compass to know right from wrong,"  he argued.
"America needs leaders who have the moral courage
to do what is right for the right reason.
It's not always easy or convenient for leaders to step
forward," he acknowledged. "Remember, even Moses
had doubts." "He was talking to you," my mother
later said. The pastor was, of course,talking
to all of us, challenging each one of us to make
the most of our lives, to assume the mantle of
leadership and responsibility wherever we find it.
He was calling on us to use whatever power we have,
in business, in politics, in our communities, and
in our families, to do good for the right reason.
And his sermon spoke directly to my heart and my
life.... There was no magic moment of decision.
After talking with my family during the Christmas
holidays, then hearing this rousing sermon,
to make most of every moment, during my inaugural
church service, I gradually felt more comfortable
with the prospect of a presidential campaign.
My family would love me, my faith would sustain
me, no matter what. "During the more than half century of
my life, we have seen an unprecedented decay in
our American culture, a decay that has eroded the
foundations of our collective values and moral
standards of conduct.
Our sense of personal responsibility has declined
dramatically, just as the role and responsibility
of the federal government have increased.
The changing culture blurred the sharp contrast
between right and wrong and created a new standard
of conduct: 'If it feels good,do it.'
and 'If you've got a problem, blame somebody else'.
"Individuals are not responsible for their actions,"
the new culture has said. "We are all victims of
forces beyond our control." We have gone from a culture of
sacrifice and saving to a culture obsessed with
grabbing all the gusto. We went from accepting
responsibility to assigning blame.
As government did more and more, individuals
were required to do less and less. >The new culture said:
if people were poor, the government should feed them.
If someone had no house, the government should provide one.
If criminals are not responsible for their acts,
then the answers are not prisons, but social programs....
"For our culture to change, it must change one heart, one soul,
and one conscience at a time. Government can spend
money, but it cannot put hope in our hearts or a
sense of purpose in our lives."... "But government should
welcome the active involvement of people who are following a
religious imperative to love their neighbors through after
school programs, child care, drug treatment,
maternity group homes, and a range of other services.
Supporting these men and women - the soldiers in
the armies of compassion - is the next bold step of
welfare reform, because I know that changing hearts
will change our entire society."
"During the opening months of my presidential
campaign, I have traveled our country and my heart has been
warmed. My experiences have reinvigorated my faith in the
greatness of Americans. They have reminded me that
societies are renewed from the bottom up, not the top down.
Everywhere I go, I see people of love and faith,
taking time to help a neighbor in need... These people and
thousands like them are the heart and soul and greatness of
America. And I want to do my part. I am running for
President because I believe America must seize this moment,
America must lead. We must give our prosperity a
greater purpose, a purpose of peace and freedom and hope. We are a
great nation of good and loving people.
And together, we have a charge to keep."

First Aid Tips
In a medical emergency, knowing what to do can make all the difference.
Here are some tips to help you handle an unexpected injury or illness:
* In the event of decapitation, sit the victim's body in a chair
as best you can, balance the head on top of the shoulders, and walk away
whistling nonchalantly.
* Always keep plenty of gauze around the house in case you invent
an invisibility potion.
* If you did all you could and the victim still dies, pat him or
her down for a Snickers bar. It's not like you don't deserve one.
* Nothing revives a stroke victim like an eye-popping orgasm.
* If someone you know is seriously injured, cradle his or her head
in your lap and scream, "Why?"
* Administering CPR is easy. Just do it like you saw them do on TV
that one time.
* In the event of accidental drug overdose, call Lou Reed
immediately.
* To stop a nosebleed, apply pressure. To start a nosebleed, apply
even greater pressure in short, repeated bursts.
* If a person requires artificial respiration, and you are of the
same sex as the person, and no one of the opposite sex is around to
perform the procedure, you are gay.
* If the Heimlich maneuver is ineffective on a choking victim,
grab his or her neck and squeeze downward to force the food into the
stomach. If this fails, grab the victim's ankles and swing him or her
around in a circle to force the food up.
* Make sure your first-aid kid contains a large, frilly Victorian
fan to revive fainting victims.
* If you are a hideous, disfigured hunchback and you see someone
who is injured and unconscious, treat the person. Then, as the person
begins to wake up, retreat into hiding. The person will always wonder
who saved him or her, and the experience will be poignant in a
bittersweet way.
* As a rule of thumb, always ask yourself this question: What
would Randolph Mantooth do?
* If possible, try to be the guy who tells the victim,
"Everything's going to be all right," while others do the actual work.

Hoecker is in San Diego today and tomorrow (congressional hearings followed

and ask him on Thursday after the regular D.C. FERC Meeting. I'll also get
started with Markey. Note that Markey, Barton, and Hoecker as well may not
want to sit on a Panel - they may demand speaking positions.
FYI - NARUC has some overlap with a couple of our potential second tier
speakers.  I got the names on background and can't list them until Chuck
Gray at NARUC has confirmed that they've been invited. Will follow up on
that in a couple days.  NARUC has its Electricity Committee meetings on
Monday, with plenary sessions on electricity on Tuesday morning (lessons
from California on state restructuring policy; Order 2000; consumer
wlelfare/response issues) and Wednesday morning (supply side responses to
price spikes, if my notes are correct).
One balance issue we haven't discussed that may help Bill - Gary Neale of
NiSource is current chairman of the NERC (North American Electric
Reliability Council Board of Trustees). Do we want a speaker who will
provide a focus on reliability issues - I think its a missing piece in our
plan (akin to leaving out NTSB and FAA out of a conference on airline
restructuring). See http://www.nerc.com/about/chairman.html

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I am faxing you separately three pages from Don Ray George, reflecting
calculations that I asked him to do concerning each individual plaintiff's
damages shown by the Rhodes study.  Specifically, Don Ray, with Marianne's
help:  (i) tried to determine the specific wells in which each individual
plaintiff had an interest; (ii) located, from Rhodes' study, the 2-page
sheets for each of those wells; (iii) added up all the over- and undertake
"values" (dollar amounts) shown for that well in the Rhodes study; and (iv)
applied plaintiffs' percentage interest to that amount.  He then added up the
individual well amounts for each plaintiff, to arrive at that plaintiff's
"actual damages per Rhodes."

The purpose of this exercise was to make a rough cut determination as to
which plaintiffs will be claiming the most damages, and therefore, to help us
decide which method of choosing ten representative plaintiffs would most
benefit us.

In doing so, we gave plaintiffs the benefit of the Rhodes Study's
methodology, with two exceptions:  (1)  for a given plaintiff, Rhodes added
up only the undertaken "values," disregarding entirely and thus failing to
offset overtaken "values;" in the scenarios on p. 1 and p. 2, we credited a
given plaintiff's overtaken values against that plaintiff's undertaken
amount;  (2)  Rhodes also added an "interest" calculation" to his numbers; we
did not use his interest calculations at all, because they are totally wrong
under the law.

But of course, Rhodes' methodology is totally flawed in numerous other
respects as well -- so much so, in our opinion, that it is utterly defective
-- and furthermore, plaintiffs have now indicated they want to rerun numbers
using different (Intratex) data.  This is just our best effort to get our
arms around some numbers at this stage based on plaintiffs' theories, with no
consideration of most of our defenses as to each individual plaintiff and to
all plaintiffs in general.

Page 1 shows the results for each individual plaintiff, crediting overtakes
against undertakes.  DISREGARD the $27 million total; that is the total only
if net overtakes from all of the overtaken plaintiffs combined are credited
against net undertakes from all of the undertaken plaintiffs combined.  At
least as of this stage, since we are not seeking contribution from overtaken
plaintiffs, that number is not valid even under our current theories.  (It
may become valid at some point, but for now, let's disregard it entirely).

Page 2 shows the cumulative total for all plaintiffs with damages, when
offsets are not considered.  The total is: $50,528,850.

Page 3 shows the cumulative total for all plaintiffs, when overtake values
are NOT taken into account.  The total is: $66,402,761.

A few observations about these numbers:

1.  First, many plaintiffs -- approximately half -- have no damages at all
under the Rhodes methodology, when undertaken values are taken into account.

2.  If my hurried calculations are right, of the $50 million shown on page 2,
$45 million represents the damages of only 8 plaintiffs (nos. 1-8).

3.  There are significant individualized defenses with respect to these
plaintiffs.  It appears at this stage that Southwest Royalties is another
Beeson -- i.e., that it acquired its interests in the wells after the 1978-88
time period at issue.  We do not yet know that SW Royalties acquired the
right to sue on the contracts.  With respect to Eclipse (Beeson's company),
we're pretty sure it did not.  American Trading and Production (ATAPCO) had
Panhandle gas, and litigated its "fraud" claim re: Panhandle; thus, all
damages as of the time of the Panhandle agreements (1985) are plainly
barred.  Almost all of Staley's damages would be foreclosed by a settlement
he entered into in 1987 (I think that's the date).  We know Joe O'Neill
deliberately underproduced a lot of the time.  Those are just a few examples
from my memory, all of which underscore that these numbers are inflated.

4.  Of course, at trial -- since the court has not certified, and they are
entitled to prove up individualized types of damages -- plaintiffs could try
for damages over and above those shown by the Rhodes study, such as
"reservoir damages" for certain individual plaintiffs, etc.  So these are not
a ceiling, necessarily.

5.  Again, using the Rhodes study as a basis is very iffy to begin with,
since plaintiffs have indicated they're going to redo their ratability
analysis using Intratex numbers -- which may yield entirely different results
-- and the Rhodes study's methodology is utterly wrong.  But at least it
gives us a rough basis with which to work at this stage of the game.

Several, months ago Limas Jefferson wrote you a letter requesting your
support for business opportunities at Enron.  That letter was subsequently
forwarded to Cindy Olson and me.  As you can see from the note below, we were
able to arrange for Jefferson & Associations to partner with Compaq on the
Windows 2000 Project.  You commented on Mr Jefferson's letter that you would
consider meeting with him.  I can be of assistance in coordinating a meeting
between the two of you.   Please advise.

FYI - Mr. Jefferson had a difficult time reaching me because my phone number
changed when my office moved to 3AC.

VICE PRESIDENT GORE
I fight for the chickens and I am fighting for the chickens right now. I
will not give up on the chickens crossing the road!  I will fight for the
chickens and I will not disappoint them.

GOVERNOR GEORGE W. BUSH
I don't believe we need to get the chickens across the road.  I say give
the road to the chickens and let them decide.  The government needs to let
go of strangling the chickens so they can get across
the road.

SENATOR LIEBERMAN
I believe that every chicken has the right to worship their God In their
own way.  Crossing the road is a spiritual journey and no chicken should be
denied the right to cross the road in their own
way.

SECRETARY CHENEY
Chickens are big-time because they have wings. They could fly if they
wanted to.  Chickens don't want to cross the road.  They don't need help
crossing the road.  In fact, I'm not interested in crossing the road
myself.

RALPH NADER
Chickens are misled into believing there is a road by the evil
tiremakers. Chickens aren't ignorant, but our society pays tiremakers to
create the need for these roads and then lures chickens into believing
there is an advantage to crossing them.  Down with the roads, up with
chickens.

PAT BUCHANAN
To steal a job from a decent, hardworking American.

JERRY FALWELL
Because the chicken was gay!  Isn't it obvious? Can't you people See the
plain truth in front of your face?  The chicken was going to the "other
side." That's what "they" call it-the "other side." Yes, my friends, that
chicken is gay.  And, if you eat that chicken, you
will become gay too.  I say we boycott all chickens until we sort out
this abomination that the liberal media whitewashes with seemingly harmless
phrases like "the other side." That chicken should not be free to cross the
road.  It's as plain and simple as that.

DR.  SEUSS
Did the chicken cross the road?  Did he cross it with a toad?  Yes!  The
chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed, I've not been told!

ERNEST HEMINGWAY
To die.  In the rain.

MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.
I envision a world where all chickens will be free to cross without having
their motives called into question.

GRANDPA
In my day, we didn't ask why the chicken crossed the road.  Someone told us
that the chicken crossed the road,and that was good enough for us.

ARISTOTLE
It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.

KARL MARX
It was a historical inevitability.

SADDAM HUSSEIN
This was an unprovoked act of rebellion and we were quite justified in
dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN
What chicken?

CAPTAIN JAMES T.  KIRK
To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

FOX MULDER
You saw it cross the road with your own eyes. How many more chickens
have to cross before you believe it?

FREUD
The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken crossed the road
reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES
I have just released eChicken 2000, which will not only cross roads, but
will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook
-and Internet Explorer is an inextricable part of eChicken.

EINSTEIN
Did the chicken really cross the road or did the road move beneath the
chicken?

BILL CLINTON
I did not cross the road with THAT chicken.  What do you mean by
"chicken"? Could you define "chicken" please?

GEORGE BUSH
I don't think I should have to answer that question.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN
The road, you will see, represents the black man. The chicken crossed
the "black man" in order to trample him and keep him down.


COLONEL SANDERS
I missed one?

Steve Smith called this afternoon.  He was anxious to know where we stood on
the issue of the third arbitrator.

He advised me that they have withdrawn Bill Paul as a proposed arbitrator.

I disclosed Judge Webster's relationship with me and my wife, and his firm's
relationship with Enron, whereupon Smith advised that they would not be
willing to have him as the neutral.

He asked me where we stood re Morris, Roberts and Sessions.  "Sessions?"
said I.  Apparently they considered putting former judge Bill Sessions on
their list but must have decided not to do so.  (the third proposal was
Layne Phillips)

I told him that we were considering them, that Beatty was going to call
Renfrew to get more info about his relationships with them, and that we
probably were going to propose some names of our own next week.

Smith advised me that the deadline for selecting the neutral was January 15
(Monday), and that they did not intend to let the schedule slip.  I told him
that we were aware of the deadline, but as a practical matter did not see
what significance it really had since going to AAA (the remedy in the letter
agreement) would only slow the process down, not speed it up.  It reiterated
about five times that they expected us to stick to the deadline and did not
want the schedule for the arbitration to slip (has this man been speaking to
Brian Redmond secretly?).

I told Smith five times that we were not going to send them names this week,
and were unlikely to agree to one of theirs this week.  I told him that if
he insisted on an answer re his remaining three prior to Monday, that would
be easy:  the answer would be no.  I told him I preferred to take the time
to actually consider whether one of them was acceptable, and assumed that's
what he would want once he thought about it.

We should try to get back to him sometime next week with a response re his
remaining three and, unless we are agreeing to one of those, some proposals
of our own.

Richard, have you gotten any feedback from JVD?

COUNT :::: 184

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Concededly unencumbered by research, I have the following preliminary
thoughts, some of which already had been expressed by David:


1.  In the context of a Rule 9 (b) motion, ordinarily the case is not
dismissed.  If the motion is granted, the plaintiff is usually given 20 or
30 days to replead.  The case remains on the docket.  I think that's what
happened on the first 9(b) conspiracy motion in the Lufkin oil case.   While
it is possible to obtain a Rule 9(b) dismissal with prejudice, that is
unlikely here in the Wright case.  Truth be told, I think that Downes could
give even Grynberg one more chance to replead.

2.   Also, the government has already intervened in part in the Wright case.
So even a dismissal of the relator's claims would leave the case in Judge
Downes' court.   Wright would have to move to sever, seek some type of Rule
54 (b) relief, or file some other motion to get out from under the existing
case -- short of filing a whole new lawsuit.

3.  Filing a new lawsuit creates limitations problems of all kinds for him.
At a minimum, he would lose more than four years of claims.

4.  A new lawsuit has "first to file" problems.  Grynberg and Osterhoudt
would be ahead of him as to some claims.  Also, remember the Perry case.  It
was transferred from New Mexico to Lufkin only recently, the MDL tag-along
notice was filed even more recently, and the case is not yet in Downes'
court.  Perry is apparently a relatively attractive relator who actually has
some first hand knowledge (at least as to Burlington).  But the government
apparently decided to stick with Wright because he was so far ahead of
Perry.   Hosie likely would be aware of the risk of the government
reconsidering the decision if Wright had to start all over.

5.  A new complaint has obvious public disclosure and original source
problems for Wright.  He would be starting all over filing material evidence
when the government already has complaints on file.

6.   Even if everything in Judy's hypothetical happened, there still would
some non-measurement issues in Downes' court.  The transportation allowance
and condensate claims (there may be one other) are not covered by the
government's motion to dismiss in the Grynberg case.  Thus, there would
still be an argument in support of MDLing a new case.  A less strong
argument, I recognize.

7.   Filing a new suit would be a high risk tactical move which likely would
anger Downes, the MDL Panel, and perhaps even Hannah.

8.   I do not favor a Rule 12(e) motion for a more definite statement.  The
case law is much different than under 9(b), or even 8(a).  Also, I believe
that it shows weakness.

9.  In short, I don't see a great risk of filing a Rule 9(b) motion.
However, what this points out (and thanks for flagging it) is that we must
be continually alert not to do anything now or later that would allow Wright
or the government to go to Downes and ask him to transfer the case back to
Lufkin.  While they can always file such a motion based on the boilerplate
language in the MDL order,  we should not say anything that will make the
Wright allegations seem so different from the Grynberg and Quinque
allegations that such motion might be taken seriously by Downes.


FINALLY, SORRY FOR THE LENGTH OF THIS E-MAIL.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Mike,
All of us working on the San Diego defense of Enron have been
attempting to watch the other class actions that we know have been filed
related to the California electricity and gas markets.  The reason is that
if there is a state court class action that is broad enough to sweep Enron
in as a doe defendant and that case is not removed, then even if we are
successful in our efforts in Hendricks and elsewhere it may all be for
nought.   The Rojoin case is somewhat different than the rest of the cases.
It was filed December 6th, but we do not whether or when it was served.  It
alleges violations of the PUC, unfair and deceptive practices, false
advertising and fraudulent concealment against ACN Energy et. al arising
from their retail sales of electricity.  In essence, plaintiffs allege in
Rojoin that they were offered electricity at 3.4 cents per KWH when in fact
the true charges to plaintiffs turned out to be about 15 cents per KWH.  One
of the allegations is that plaintiffs were not told of the "sneaky way that
the fees are recalculated."
In short, the Rojoin complaint as written does not really address
the wholesale market other than to allege that ACN is acting to take
advantage of the "deregulated" electricity market.
Counsel for one of the other defendants, Chris Healy, has commented
that they have concerns that this case may be the weakest in terms of
removal under a federal question.  If the defendants try to remove that case
and lose it could be harmful or undermine the basis for removal in the other
cases.  As a practical matter, Jean Frizzel, Dave Noonan, Mike Kirby and I
tend to agree with him.  As you know, we are trying to find out who is
representing ACN to see what they are planning to do.
Since the Rojoin allegations are aimed exclusively right now at the
residential market, we thought it important to bring you up to date.  Unless
EES has a similar fact pattern to that alleged in the complaint (e.g. energy
rates charged to customers as the higher of 3.4 cents per kwh or the
difference between 3 cents and the power exchange price without revealing
what the power exchange price might be), this may be a stand alone case
where it is unlikely that EES would be brought in.
Mike Kirby and Dave Noonan are looking at the question of whether if
the Rojoin complaint is amended, new defendants would have the ability to
seek removal then.
Bottom line - given the unique fact pattern of the Rojoin case and
subject to your confirmation that EES does not have a similar fact pattern,
it may make sense to just let the Rojoin case alone and not attempt to
influence counsel for the defense with respect to removal and focus our
efforts on the Berg, Continental Forge and Phillip cases.
Do you concur?

Thanks
Gary

Edison International CFO Disputes 'Technical Insolvency' Claim
By Mark Golden
10/03/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- Edison International's treasurer and chief financial
officer, Ted Craver, disputed Tuesday a claim made last week that
California's utilities risk "technical insolvency" in 2001.
Since May, California's three investor-owned utilities have been spending far
more to purchase needed electricity than they are getting paid by customers.
As a result, the undercollections in the "transition revenue account" of
Edison's regulated utility unit, Southern California Edison, grew by $1.97
billion between May 1 and August 31, the company reported to the Securities
Exchange Commission.
An article Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, which is published by Dow
Jones & Co., said that "if the cost of wholesale power continues to exceed
the price these utilities are allowed to bill their customers, as currently
seems likely, they could become technically insolvent sometime next year."
"The way this term was used insinuated that you take the transition revenue
account, and whatever the gross number is equates to the amount of debt that
you would have to raise," Craver said in an interview. "That is not at all
the way it works. That is not an accurate portrayal."
California Gov. Gray Davis acknowledged the concerns Friday, saying,
"California consumers have a legitimate need for California's utilities to
remain solvent, and the state must be committed toward that end."
But Edison's Craver said the situation is not that simple.
"That transition revenue account balance says nothing about what we have to
fund in the market," Craver said. "Southern California Edison has some 37
balancing and memo accounts set up by the California Public Utilities
Commission. What we have to fund is the net amount of all of them, plus
whatever else is going on, and the net figure is considerably smaller than
the $1.97 billion. It's like picking out one line item on the balance sheet
and saying this is all that matters. No accountant does that or looks at it
that way."
Craver also said that the term "technical insolvency" has no specific meaning
to him.
A PG&E Corp (PCG) spokesman declined to comment when asked this week if it
risks technical insolvency next year. The company is seeking refunds from
independent generators that have been selling power to the state's utilities,
and for the future it has asked the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to
consider a return to cost-based pricing specific to each generating station
in the state.
Utility bond analysts, nevertheless, are concerned about California utility
debt.
"I don't believe the utilities are going to go bankrupt, but they don't have
any assurance from the legislature, governor or regulators," Bear Stearns's
Ted Olshanski said. "The uncertainty is critical."
Bear Stearns has a negative outlook on Edison and PG&E bonds due to the
uncertainty on the recovery of these energy costs.
This summer's period of undercollections has continued into the fall, with
the California's wholesale market for Wednesday power at $135 a
megawatt-hour, compared with the $65/MWh that SCE gets from customers.
The current best asking price for on-peak power fall all of 2001 in southern
California is $85/MWh.
When asked how long Edison can continue to fund the difference between its
purchase power costs and the revenue it receives from customers, Craver
responded: "How long can ratepayers or anyone afford those prices, which
don't have anything to do with reality? The market mechanisms don't work."
California's utilities are hoping to make significant changes to the market,
and some of those changes would require action by the state legislature,
which is out of session until December.
"I don't know that this is something that waits for the legislature," Craver
said. "There are a lot of things that can be done before the legislature
meets. We have significant issues before the FERC and the CPUC."
Olshanski said he hoped for a political solution.
"We're not sure how its going to end," he said. "We expect regulators and
legislators to step up and provide for a constructive resolution. In the
past, the California legislature has approved measures to make companies
whole."

12 opening kickoff against Oklahoma State. Only one other UT jersey has been
retired and it belongs to the school's only other Heisman Trophy winner -
Earl Campbell's No. 20.

UT officials wanted to do this last year, but Texas didn't have a home game
when Williams' New Orleans Saints were off. This week, the Saints have a bye.

Just a refresher, Williams left Texas with 21 NCAA records and 46 UT
records. Among his 15 NCAA career records that still stand are his 7,206
all-purpose yards, 11,200-yard rushing games and 6.2 yards per carry. His
6,279 rushing yards, 72 rushing touchdowns and 75 total touchdowns rank
second on the NCAA all-time career lists.

Williams claimed the NCAA rushing titles in 1997 and 1998 and was the NCAA
scoring leader in 1997.

This came in from one of the readers this week:

Just wanted to let you know that a multimedia (CD-ROM) tribute to Ricky
Williams has been available for almost a year. It contains video showing
Ricky breaking about 10 records, a panoramic tour of the UT football
facilities, Ricky Williams personal scrapbooks, his rings and trophies in 3D,
and a few other notable features. Unfortunately the company that produced the
CD-ROM (called Run Ricky!) has gone out of business due to the fact the NCAA
would not allow the company to release the title during the summer. But the
CD-ROM is still available at the Texas co-op and Longhorns Ltd. at
DKR-Memorial.




Longhorn Q & A
Q: What is the start time for the Texas-Oklahoma game?
Sanford Gaines

BROWN:  The Texas OU-game is 11 a.m. Oct. 7 at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas.

Ivan Williams

Q: Last year, the coaches raved about Ivan Williams and almost took off his
redshirt. Now, a year later, he hasn't gotten a sniff at real playing time at
tailback. What happened to tailback by committee? It seems like we could use
a bigger back (given the lack of blocking prowess by the O-line).
Bob Nance



BROWN:  Good question. The coaches took a good look at everyone in the
Houston game. They came away thinking that Kenny Hayter needs some more
carries. They still think that Ivan Williams is developing the toughness
needed to run in college. In the Louisiana-Lafayette game, coaches thought he
was running tentatively.

Just as an aside, Hodges Mitchell says the running game is going to cut loose
this week. He says this season has been just like last season. For three
games, the running game has been Nikes stuck in glue. But he says this week
is the week. If it is, there would be no better confidence-builder than to do
it against the nation's top rushing defense. OSU is giving up just 30.3 yards
per game rushing this season. (Texas is fourth nationally against the run,
yielding 47.0 ypg). I think it will be tough sledding for the UT RBs this
week. Should be a good passing game, though.



Q: Many of us who discuss this frequently still question the play-calling on
offense, and feel that Texas can never win a national championship with Greg
Davis as offensive coordinator. Any comments?
Reggie Reeves

BROWN:  Davis is not the problem. His offenses routinely rate among the
nation's best in either rushing, passing or total offense. This season, UT is
fourth nationally in pass offense (366.5 yards per game). The running game
stinks. But he has gotten the passing game to the top with a quarterback
rotation that appears to have kept both Major Applewhite and Chris Simms from
peaking and with receivers who are barely old enough to shave.

Davis is in constant contact with Gary Kubiak of the Denver Broncos. The
Broncos are considered one of the most cutting-edge offenses in the NFL.
Davis is constantly tapping into Kubiak and trying to bring in new wrinkles
to the UT offense. I don't know if anyone works harder than he does. Plus,
the quarterbacks love him. Even if they don't love this rotation, they love
him. I have seen no signs that this rotation has eroded that relationship.

Davis is solid. In fact, if there is a UT coach who could leave the staff in
the near future for a head job or head coordinator job in the NFL, it's Greg
Davis.



Q: In your first newsletter I asked you why is everyone so excited about
this year's team when they showed last year that they could not run the
football. Against the big boys, you better have more balance. You replied
that the line is one year older and should be better. No, Chip, sorry, but
they are less than a year older since they struggled at the end of the season
with running and picking up blitzes. Now, not to say I told you so, but it is
still a serious problem that you sports writers overlooked and got too caught
up in the QB hype and the great receiving corps. Shame on you.

Maybe that offensive line is not as great as you guys thought? I see UT going
8-3 this year and hanging around at 15th, which is where they should be. They
are still young and not hungry enough as evidenced by poor starts against
really bad teams. Horn fans and sportswriters need to be a bit more patient
this year and take off their blinders. Maybe being a sportswriter during my
days at UT helped me see through the hype. Hook'em!
Larry, Dallas

BROWN:  I thought this offensive line would be much better than it's shown
this season, but I wouldn't give up on them. Everyone saw UT's third
possession against Houston in which Leonard Davis and Derrick Dockery - two
guys I think have to take leadership roles on that line - allowed a DE to go
untouched right between them and stuff the running back for a 6-yard loss.

This kind of play should be a deep concern for UT coaches. Dockery has been
sick, and is still trying to regain weight lost while out with an infected
cyst. Davis has struggled to get chemistry with Dockery's backup, Tillman
Holloway. Offensive coordinator Greg Davis says the line tends to play better
in the second half than it does in the first half because it takes a while
for them to get on the same page and see what the defense is doing. That,
however, may be too late against a good team.

The old adage goes that you have to have a senior-laden offensive line to
have any real chance at a national title or Top 10 success. So far, that
appears to be true. Texas' O-line has just two seniors (Leonard Davis, Cory
Quye), two juniors (Antwan Kirk-Hughes, Matt Anderson) and a sophomore
(Derrick Dockery).



Q: How frustrated is Chris Simms with his lack of playing time? In the
off-season I kept hearing about how most of the players were really impressed
with the passing abilities of Simms. Are any of the players now questioning
why Chris is not playing more than he is?
Jeff Weaver, Dallas

BROWN:  Simms said this week that the rotation is difficult. But players
have not chosen sides. Simms says there are times when he makes a mistake and
would love to go back in and correct it, even though his rotation is up and
Major Applewhite is coming in. The questions for both guys are constant.

Simms also said there are times when he knows it's his last series before
Applewhite comes in, and it's third-and-17 and he's tempted to throw a deep
pass to try to make something happen and stay in the game. Against Houston,
he had a situation like that and opted to throw a 6-yard route to B.J.
Johnson, the safer choice. "It was the smarter thing to do," he said.

My theory was that the coaches would try to get Simms as much playing time as
possible in the first four games to show what he can do. And then, come
Oklahoma, the coaches settle on one QB. After the OSU game, I think the
coaches need to settle on one guy for awhile and give credence to the
hot-hand policy Brown said he would employ this season. The question is, will
Simms get enough snaps to show he deserves to be that guy? Right now, coaches
have tended to lean on Applewhite whenever it's crunch time.

Major Applewhite

Q: Major Applewhite has become the red-headed straight-A student who is
having to contend with the jock favored son. Mack Brown has to appease alums
and parents (Simms') who want to see Phil Simms' son as UT's QB. I think what
is being done is a ... (I have to say  it) ... a Major Injustice.
A "Major" Longhorn fan from Dallas

BROWN:  I think there is a misconception out there that Phil Simms is
constantly calling Mack Brown, demanding that he give Chris more playing
time. Or that Mack Brown made some deal with the Simms family, assuring
everyone that Chris would get playing time. None of that is true.

According to Chris, the only assurance he received is that he would be
allowed to

compete  for the starting job. So far, that's what's happened. Now, whether
Chris continues to make the most of his playing time and shows that he
deserves to get substantial minutes remains to be seen.

It's hard to argue with Applewhite's results so far this season. Here's a
breakdown of their stats: Applewhite is 49 of 87 passing (56.3 percent
completion rate) for 729 yards with 6 TDs and 3 interceptions. He has a QB
rating of 142.57. Simms has completed 19 of 36 passes (52.8 percent) for 257
yards with three TDs and three interceptions. His QB rating is 123.58. But
Brown is not trying to appease Simms as much as he is trying to see what
Simms can do.



Q: Is the quarterback rotation hurting the UT offense?
Sara McFadden

BROWN:  I asked Major Applewhite if he was playing up to his ability this
season. He said no. I asked him if Chris Simms was playing as well as he
could. Applewhite said no. If one or the other was given the QB job until he
lost the hot hand, you wonder if there might be some more rhythm to this
offense. But it's almost impossible to know.

The players say it doesn't matter who is playing QB, they're both solid. It
is hard to argue that Major shouldn't be the man. All he's done is win and
break records. Simms is still adjusting to college ball and not being "the
man" for the first time in his competitive life. Every time he has walked
onto a football field, he's been Phil Simms' kid and the top choice to play
QB. Now, he's battling with a guy who has Major results.

I thought that the rotation was hurting the offense. But offensive
coordinator Greg Davis justifiably pointed out to me that UT has passed for
more yards through three games this year than it did last year. So I decided
to break everything down in the passing game, comparing UT's offense through
three games this year to the first three games of 1999. While Texas has more
passing yards (986 in 2000 to 940 in 1999) and more TD passes (9 in 2000 to 7
in 1999), the combined completion percentage of both QBs is down (55.3 in
2000 to 61.6 in 1999). UT also has more interceptions this year (6 in 2000 to
1 in 1999). And one of those picks was returned for a touchdown.

I tend to think Applewhite's numbers would be much better if he were allowed
to start and stay in. Of course, Simms would have better numbers, too, if he
got to play most of the game. But by sharing, I think both of their
production is down. Maybe it's just a matter of getting used to this
rotation. We'll see how long everyone can keep a positive attitude about
this. Davis said Tuesday he could see the team rotating both quarterbacks all
season long.



Q: What is the source of greater confusion for the O-line: opposing
defenses' tactics or Texas' own offensive scheme?  In other words, is the
offense too complex so that they don't know their assignments  or are they
simply being outplayed?
Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas

BROWN:  The offensive linemen, quarterbacks and coaches all say that they
have seen a slew of junk defenses through the first three games. Coach Mack
Brown said Louisiana-Lafayette, Stanford and Houston did not use defensive
schemes that they had shown in previous games.

Brown's contention is that other teams can make their season by beating UT,
so they gamble and throw a bunch of risky blitzes at the Longhorns. Against
Stanford, UT wasn't good enough to make the Cardinal pay. So, according to UT
personnel, the defenses have been new. Now that it's the fourth game of the
season, one would think there are only so many defenses the O-line hasn't
seen. The excuses are running out.







[IMAGE]
Ricky Brown

Q: It appears to me that Texas really misses the blocking of Ricky Brown,
both in the running game and in the blitz pick-up. Who is Texas recruiting to
replace him? I don't question Matt Trissel's effort, but he just doesn't seem
to be getting it done for Texas.
Bart Jacobs

BROWN:  The coaches are recruiting a fullback named James Buchanan of
Sarasota, Fla., Cardinal Mooney, who is also being pursued by Florida State
and Florida. But they are happy with Matt Trissel. They say he's young and
needs a little more time to get adjusted to the fullback position after
excelling at linebacker in high school. Mack Brown considers Trissel a leader
on the offense despite his status as a redshirt freshman. He's had some
botched blocking assignments, but so have all the other backs.



Q: Despite a visit from the nutritionist during the off-season, and a much
publicized weight loss, the offensive line still appears overweight and slow.
What is Jeff Madden doing the rectify this problem? If this problem
persists,

might Texas be looking to hire a new strength coach? I know Madden is a good
friend of Mack Brown's, but production has to be the bottom line, and right
now, it appears Madden isn't getting it done. I enjoy your newsletter. Thank
you for your time.
James Taglienti

BROWN:  Madden is someone I consider UT's secret weapon. He's much more than
a coach for this team. He works their bodies and minds and can be credited
with getting this team to believe that it could beat Nebraska back in 1998.
The players love and respect him even though he works them to the ground.
None of the breakdowns so far this season can be attributed to Madden.
Physically, the players are in good shape. Their problems are mental. Madden
is one of the most valued members of the staff.

Q: Are there any hopes for a national championship considering the loss to
Stanford?
Liddy Newsome

BROWN:  Anything is possible. Texas would need Nebraska to remain
undefeated, and then hope the other top 10 teams pick up a loss or two. If
Texas could go unbeaten the rest of the way and beat an undefeated and No. 1
Nebraska in the Big 12 title game, the Longhorns could possibly get lucky and
end up in the Orange Bowl. But that is about as long a shot as Ricky Williams
suiting up for UT this Saturday.



Q: I have heard a lot about how much talent Chance Mock has. How does his
talent compare to that of Chris Simms? If he wouldn't have redshirted, could
he have beat out Chris or possibly Major Applewhite as the main guy?
Brett Holmes

BROWN:  Not a chance. No pun intended. Mock asked to redshirt because he has
much to learn and wants to step in after Simms and Applewhite move on.



Q: I think Hodges Mitchell is a good kid, with a good pedigree ... and
there's the rub. Is Coach Brown too in love with this kid? Is he doing an old
friend a favor by keeping this kid in the game? He had a decent season last
year, especially coming out of the shadow of Ricky Williams, but I have seen
nothing this year that suggests anything close to that this season.

I cannot blame the O-line and here is why: For a prototypical "scat-back,"
Hodges seems to run to traffic. There were several plays last week where a
quick step one way or the other would have gotten him to more open field.
Instead he would run right into the defense. Does he just not have the
"vision" required of a good running back? I cannot believe that he is that
much better than the other running backs on the roster. Are the rest that
bad? There has to be more to the story.
Roy Cassas

BROWN:  Mitchell apparently needs to be pushed to the brink of losing his
job to really find traction. Last year, he was on the verge of losing his job
to Victor Ike when he started to really cut loose on the way to 1,300 yards
rushing and 300 yards receiving. He says he is ready to cut loose, again (in
the fourth game, just like last year).  The problem is, Texas is playing
Oklahoma State this week, who has the nation's No. 1 defense against the run.
Last year, Mitchell broke a couple draws on Oklahoma State and ran for 149
yards. We'll see if he can shake the slump he's in. Otherwise, look for Ike
and Kenny Hayter to start getting more of the load.



Q: In your most recent "Inside UT Football" you mentioned that stations on
the UT football network are listed on the texassports.com Web site. I have
another suggestion for people such as me who live in other parts of the
country, or overseas. I have found that all (I think) NCAA top 25 broadcasts
are carried on http://sports.yahoo.com/. They carry all NFL radio broadcasts
as well. One of the beauties about this site is that if you don't like one
set of announcers you can usually switch over to those who carry the opposing
team. As my grandson would say, "And that's really cool." I enjoy your weekly
newsletter very much. Keep it up.
Bud Sloan, Reno, Nev.

BROWN:  Thanks for sharing, Bud. Hope this helps some other folks.



Q: Why does Coach Mack Brown reject criticism with cynicism, yet accept
praise with zeal? To illustrate my point, Coach Brown became terse while
citing fans as "... being negative and openly critical ..." (i.e., four
losses in five games, 100 net yards rushing in five games, a probable QB
controversy and lest we not forget, yet another blocked punt). Conversely,
Coach Brown will devour praise with carnivorous delight! Coach Brown cites
the team's emotional psyche as "... being fragile," yet Coach Brown fueled
this euphoria in the players during spring drills and prior to the season.

Is it not the coach's responsibility to provide stability to the team's
mental and emotional state? Is Coach Brown's tenure paralleling the turbulent
and volatile path taken by rival coach Jackie Sherrill at Texas A(no egos in
that one!) during the 1980s?
David Newburn

BROWN:  Mack Brown says all of his responses to criticism are simply to help
his players and protect them from getting unfairly ripped. Brown is very
sensitive to criticism. If someone criticizes the running game, he reminds
them that the passing game is rated No. 4 nationally. When someone questions
the quarterback rotation, he tells people to be positive instead of negative
and contends that the players are fine with it - only the media is not.  I
honestly think that Brown tries to see everything in such a positive light
that he becomes personally offended at criticism and negative thinking. He
forgets that people are deeply, deeply passionate about their team. That
people get mad, really mad, when their team loses a game it shouldn't. Or
worse, when the team plays really lousy in losing a game it shouldn't (see
Stanford).

I think Brown also believes that because he is so forthcoming in public
appearances and with the media and has done so much to restore the tradition
to UT, that he feels betrayed when fans or the press criticize parts of his
team. He wants fans to rally behind their team, no matter what, and be the
first to pick up the team when it's down. Not pile on.

But people are going to get angry when his team gives up five sacks, gets 10
penalties and gives up another blocked punt for a TD. There is no question he
is still adjusting to the intense scrutiny that comes with being at Texas.
When his team loses a game it shouldn't and plays terribly in doing so, he
will always hear it from the fans and the press, whether his team is young or
not.



Q: Why do you suppose the Longhorns are throwing so few really long passes
this year? It seems to me doing so would open up the running game like it was
when Ricky Williams was playing.
Will Vernon

BROWN:  They need some more time. The young receivers need a little more
time to adjust. But I do think that with the athleticism of the young
receivers, you will see more short routes that turn into long gains. Once Roy
Williams, Sloan Thomas and B.J. Johnson develop some comfort in this offense,
I think you'll see more long pass plays.



Q: I just have two questions that have been frustrating for me this year.
The first deals with punt returns. I can respect Coach Mack Brown wanting to
have an experienced player returning punts in order to avoid mistakes, but
why bring in so much talent and speed if you aren't going to use it? Why does
Hodges Mitchell continue to return punts?

He is too much of a dance-around, east-west runner to be successful in the
kicking game. I realize he averaged close to 10-yds a return Saturday, but
his average was more a product of Houston's poor field position. We need a
gamebreaker returning kicks. If you trust the freshmen to play significant
minutes, why not trust them with the return game?

Secondly, why do we pull Casey Hampton on third-down passing situations?
Hampton is a load and usually gets double-teamed. Why would you pull your
All-American in a situation like that? In their nickel defense, shouldn't
they push Shaun Rogers outside and leave Hampton in the middle?
Jeff Wilson

BROWN:  Brown trusts Mitchell not to get tight and muff a punt return in
front of 80,000 people. That's not the greatest criteria, in my opinion. I
would like to see Nathan Vasher back there personally, just to see what he
can do. Vasher has been fearless in everything I've seen him do. Mitchell
hasn't shown breakaway moves yet. If we don't see it soon, it might be time
to give someone else a shot.

They take Hampton out on nickel situations because they think that Shaun
Rogers is the better pass rusher from the tackle position. There has been no
talk about moving Rogers to end in pass-rush situations.



Q: Coach Mack Brown appeared to be auditioning for the head coach job at the
University of Oklahoma in the last minutes of the Houston game. Apparently
unsatisfied with a 40-0 lead and two minutes to go, the Horns unloaded a long
pass from the arm of Chris Simms who hadn't been able to do anything all
night. Just when everyone was ready to run the clock out,  Brown, or Simms
(whoever was in charge), elected to do whatever necessary to humiliate our
guests even more by rubbing their noses in it. I, for one, was not very proud
of being a Texas-ex for the last two minutes of that game. Texas football
traditions took a hard blow in that  Switzer-like move. Shame.
Jim Ball, Class of '57, Big Sandy, Texas

BROWN:  Mack Brown says he had Simms throwing late in the game to get
experience and live snaps because there could come a time in the future where
Texas needs to move the ball late in a game to win, as it needed to do
against Stanford.

The pass into the end zone to Sloan Thomas in the waning seconds was a
checkoff that Chris Simms made. Mack Brown said he wished that Simms hadn't
done that. But Simms actually made the right read. Simms said he bobbled the
snap or it would have been a touchdown.

There was a huge outpouring of criticism for having Simms pass the ball when
UT needs experience running the ball. What better time to work on running the
ball than at the end of the game? There is an argument to be made there. Mack
Brown said his team got criticized for not being able to hold onto the ball
and run out the clock after taking a lead at the end of the Stanford game.
Now, he says he's being criticized for moving the ball at the end of the
Houston game.

"We get hammered either way," Brown said. He added that he wasn't trying to
run it up on Houston for the chop block that led to Shaun Rogers' injury, and
he wasn't trying to pay back the Cougars for what John Jenkins used to do in
running it up. He said the team was just working to get better.



Q: What happened to Sneezy Beltran, the much-heralded running back out of
Abilene High?
Eddie Alvarado

BROWN:  Beltran has asked to redshirt this season.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Chris,

A couple of years ago the East and the Central Desks decided that Empire
State Pipeline in NY would
be changed from an "East Desk pipeline" to a "Central Desk pipeline" in our
scheduling and accounting
systems.  The reason for that decision was to fix the significant OA
variances both desks were experiencing
by the Sithe book liquidations, and to better control and manage all the
subtle little issues under the gas
sales agreement.  Since the only transaction that was being done on Empire
was the Sithe deal, this
approach has worked great and the OA and contract problems have been
corrected.

Over the last month or so, Sithe pointed out to us that some days CNG North
Point gas prices were high
enough so that Chippawa gas could be shipped over to CNG Lysander and still
make a margin.  I talked
to Geoff Storey about it and told him to keep that trade in mind.  At the
time I assumed that Sithe's IT
contract would be used to ship the volumes from Chippawa to one of the new
interconnects with NFGS
at Pendleton or CNG at Lysander and that we would just schedule it on the
Central Desk and report the
transactions under our monthly revenue sharing transactions with Sithe.

If ENA begins shipping gas on Empire under our own agreement, there are a
couple things that I am very
concerned about:

o   ENA has a contractual obligation to optimize Sithe's transportation
assets & to split
the incremental revenues with Sithe,
o   Empire desperately wants to Sithe's new 750 MW plant to be served
through Empire
and if we start doing alot of IT business on Empire the word will
probably get back to Sithe,
o   I hope that Empire Pipeline continues to be a "Central Desk pipeline" in
our systems.  We can
not go back to that mess we had before when the Sithe deal was split
between two desks.

I will be back in the office on Tuesday, maybe we can get everybody together
an make sure that we can
come up with a plan that works for everybody.

Thanks,
Ruth

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Talked to Bill Reed.  In his comments, he will say:

FERC should be more prescriptive.  Can't wait for a new board, made of new
people, to act.  FERC needs to be more assertive--I told him we're all for
leadership from FERC.
They will strongly support the end of the buy-sell requirement and express
concern about the CPUC's micromanagement of utility purchases--I told him
we'd have a similar message on that issue.
FERC should "PJM" the California market--I told him we would differ
significantly on that issue, i.e., PJM-ing generaly, and "merging" the PX and
the ISO.
He said his comments on "refunds" would be "narrow" and would point out that
the FERC staff report says there is evidence of specific "bad actors" and
that those bad actors should be required to give refunds--I told him that our
position hasn't changed on retroactive ratemaking.
I explained our position on getting more information to the market sooner.
He said that it sounds like a good idea.
I told him about our message on price caps.  He said that he would stress
that price caps ought to be a temporary "fix," and should be removed just as
soon as the market is "functional."

Steve: I told him he should search you out prior to the start of the panel
tomorrow and talk more.

Best,
Jeff

Best,

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


IN THE SPIRIT OF LET US MAKE IT BETTER - NOT IN TED IS CHUCKING BLAME AROUND,
PLEASE CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING ISSUE:

At the Audit Comittee Meeting, Jeff made the comment that the number of and
timing of the limit notifications caused them to be meaningless.  Now part of
that was an attempt by him to diffuse the number of notifications represented
graphically, but I think that there is an element of truth, particularly of
late.  therefore, I propose that we work toward making that timing faster and
the impact more meaningful.

I think the following might help:
1) Cassandra will be our point person, therefore it will be faster than
waiting for the slower, more distracted and less organized ME
2) I will propose that we raise the threshholds for notifications,
particularly at Jeff's level - I think that the sheer volume makes an
impression on Rick. Unfortunately, I think that it will not be in effect
until after the Dec bd meeting.  FYI I have proposed this at least twice and
have been shot down by Greg and Rick, but now that a smart guy is proposing
it, it will probably get more attention.
3) We should use the executive report viewer as the mechanism for delivery.
I do not know who actually supports that thing so please let me know.
It has been important to AA for audit purposes to see "evidence" that Rick,
Jeff, Ken and Bd received appropriate notification - so that needs to be
considered.
Another possibility would be RisktRAC.  The 3-d solution contracted for
contains an "Executive View" of "hot spots" .  Unfortunately, even though
Jeff requested it on his desk top 5 months ago, we can't get the IT resources
to pay attention to it.  IT however, has been interviewed several times for
magazines and have created such incredibly successful and useful products
such as EnergyDesk.com, Credit.com, En-lighten,
..............................................................................
..

Conceptually,
Notifications should take place before trading begins the next day.  This may
be utopian, but it is fundamentally correct (just because Enron doesn't know
it is supposed to, doesn't make it right).  I am certain that real risk
management organizations have a mechanism in place for this.   It  may be
necessary to create a SWAG process that is lightning fast with a more exact

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


For those who have never traveled to the great West, cattle guards are
horizontal steel rails placed on the road at fence openings to prevent
cattle from crossing.  For some reason the bovines will not step on the
guards, probably because they fear getting their feet caught between the
rails. I need to make that clear in order for you to appreciate the
following true story:

President Clinton received a report that there were over 100,000 cattle
guards in Colorado.  Because Colorado ranchers protested his proposed
changes in grazing policies, he ordered Secretary of Interior Bruce
Babbitt to fire half of the guards immediately. Before Babbitt could
respond, and presumably straighten him out, Colorado's congresswoman
Pat Schroeder intervened with a request that before any were fired, they
be given six months of retraining.

Al Gore, never one to pass up a chance to piggy back on any story,
pointed out that if the Guards had formed a strong union, such as the
teachers have with the NEA, they would not be in jeopardy.

....And so it goes, in this election year.  Don't you just love the
smell of political napalm in the morning?  We are governed by a pack of
fools!






What is a Goron?


1. Gorons sincerely believe that Vice President Gore is a true
environmentalist, when he has an environmental disaster on his
own
farm: a
polluting zinc mine, from which he received $500,000 of income
last
year.

2. Gorons likewise believe that the VP is anti-smoking and
anti-tobacco
when he has operated a tobacco farm for decades and accepted
government
subsidies.

3. Gorons truly believe that Gore is a Vietnam war hero, when in
fact
he
was placed by family influence in a "cushy" correspondent's job
and
the
only action he saw was that of his Brownie camera!(and his bong)

4. Gorons actually believe that Al Gore is justified in illegally
raising
political funds from the Office of the VP, simply because the
Vanderbilt
Law educated VP claims he was ignorant of the illegality.

5. Gorons further believe that it was OK for Al Gore to accept large
sums
of political money from China through Buddhist monks who had
taken
vows of
poverty, since he again claimed ignorance.

6. Gorons also believe that the man who claimed to "invent the
internet"
would be so computationally ignorant that he could lose weeks of
potentially incriminating e-mail!

7. Gorons, incredibly, believe Gore's claim that he and Tipper were
the
models for the book and movie, "Love Story" even though the
book's
author,
Erich Segal, says that's a bunch of crap.

8. Gorons, amazingly, believe that Gore will be the consumer's
champion
against high gasoline prices although Gore holds a million
dollars
in
Occidental Petroleum stock.

9. Gorons applaud Mr. Lieberman's open rejection of President
Clinton's
immorality, but believe it was fine for Mr. Gore to remain
silent
on
the
subject, while simultaneously declaring Mr. Clinton "one of the
greatest
Presidents of our history."

10. Gorons believe that Al Gore is an effective leader, when they
won't
bother to look at his record as a Tennessee Senator, a record so
ineffective that it has led to election of Republicans as BOTH
of
Tennessee's senators.

11. Gorons hold the belief that Gore is a compassionate man who will
be
the working man's friend, in spite of the eviction notice he
served
to the
poor family who complained about the conditions of the run down
slum
house that he was renting to them.


Cautionary Note:Medical researchers acknowledge the Gorons are
generally
harmless, except when allowed into a voting booth. There,
unfortunately,
overcome by their gullibility syndrome, they are apt to actually
vote
for
Gore! They should be carefully protected from their ailment,
since
it
may
be harmful to their well-being, yours, mine, and that of the USA.
Therefore, PLEASE, heed the Surgeon General's warning, reach out
to
aid
the Gorons in overcoming the syndrome, and PLEASE pass this on to
your
normal friends, who might also know Gorons who need immediate
treatment.

All,
before we take precipitate action, can we all speak to ensure we are all on
the same page about this.
Firstly - the decision to add a Hong Kong password application on the
registration screen was taken in full knowledge of the relevant law and
everyone should be aware of the process that was gone through
Secondly - if I understand David's note, the conclusion is "we believe there
is no problem but we may attract some attention". We need to determine how
concerned we are about that and whether our concern merits the inconvenience
(is that all it is?) of removing the password application;
Thirdly - we are already pregnant. The application is already there. If
removing it solves the problem, why not wait until we know we have the
problem and then remove it?
Fourthly - all David's questions are valid and should be answered.
When we have discussed it, the right decision may well be to remove the
password application.
Mark, David F.  - could you make 4pm today London time (10am yours). Justin
and I will call you Mark at 4pm.  If not, I'll ask Tracy to fix something up.
Obviously David Minns can't make that, but I have a call with David on
Thursday and can update him then.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Matt advised me today that John Nowlan and John Chismar have decided that
they want to try to settle this case before the joint survey takes place and
that they will likely appoint Paul Henking, their new head chartering person
in Singapore (formerly of Enron's Houston office) to contact Mitsubishi about
this.

A.  A number of new developments may have influenced this decision (although
I would rely on Matt's knowledge about this, as he actually spoke with Nowlan
and Chismar):

1.  SGS's Singapore lab  continues to struggle with trying to implement the
joint survey test program that Steve Jones, our chemist, wants to use.  In
order to determine if SGS is up to it, Jones feels that it will be necessary
to send Alan Goddard (another one of our experts) to SGS's Singapore lab and
assist in the trials, at an additional cost of about $7,250.  Goodard can't
leave for another ten days or so, causing further delay.  Goodard may or may
not conclude at the end of his stay that SGS is up to it.  ECT's other
options are clearly second choices in terms of cost and strategy.

2.  ECT's damages now appear to be harder to prove.  As to the Elang Crude
cargo at issue, ECT was recently able to calculate that it actually
reportedly made over $500,000 more than if ECT had sold the cargo to FGH.
ECT's big loss was having to substitute a naptha cargo for the Elang Crude
that FGH had rejected.  That loss is reportedly in the range of about
$1,300,000.  However, this seems to raise a number of issues:

(a)  Is this a recoverable consequential damage?  I haven't yet looked at the
charter to see if there is any contractual limitation on damages.

(b)  can we prove that we in fact had to substitute naptha for condensate
(our contract with FGH reportedly requires us to sell the naptha at a big
discount)?  Our traders would reportedly have a tough time stating under oath
that there was no condensate available; our key problem was lack of
confidence what the D3605 test would show even with condensate that we
thought was on spec.

3.  ECT has determined that it may need to recharter vessels from Mitsubishi
in the future for strategic routes.

There may be other reasons for Nowland and Chismar's decision, and I invite
Matt to report on anything else of which he is aware.

B.  Settlement Strategy

Matt advises that Nowlan and Chismar want to offer to settle for a net
payment of $250,000 by Mitsubishi to us (Matt, I would appreciate your
helping me out with the numbers on how that figure was calculated).  I have
told Matt in the past that I believe a drop hands agreement between ECT and
Mitsubishi would be a very good result, and I think he and I agree.  David
Best also agreed with a drop hands agreement when I mentioned it to him in
the past (although he will not be aware until receipt of this e-mail of the
recent revelation regarding the damages figures).

I will keep you advised.

Britt

Back to reality

Sept. 21, 2000


[IMAGE]Chip Brown, The Dallas Morning News' Texas writer, answers your
questions about what went wrong against Stanford, Coach Mack Brown's response
to the loss, the continuing quarterback controversy, UT players in the NFL
and more. Inside UT Football appears every Thursday.


E-mail questions to Chip: chipbrown@dallasnews.com



Listen to Chip Brown talk about the Longhorns on
dallasnews.com's Colleges site



CHIP SHOTS


Every year since 1983, Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four games
of the season. That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the past
17 years - usually before Texas-OU weekend.

Orangebloods spend winter, spring and summer discussing the impact of new
recruits, the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning
starters. They spend money on season tickets, airplane tickets and alumni
luncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hopes
have usually come crashing down.

Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985 and
1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or
losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four
losses.

In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2-1
run in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,
respectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the
Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.




Longhorn Q & A
Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of last
season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There is
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think the
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving
us.

In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our best
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experienced
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to start
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively and
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people
miss in the open field.

I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarterback.
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chance
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?
The Jackson residence

BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out -
change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telling
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be too
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT then
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's
opponent, Houston.

That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread was
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolve
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a hard
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhorns
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will be
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire
being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. But
changes will have to be made constructively and gradually.







[IMAGE]
Chris Simms

Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?
Mitch Golding

BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start
because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the
trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll
see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic in
his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a
miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see
what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other

to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games.

Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mack
Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of
his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. He
said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to me
that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, light
it up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watch
like everyone else.

I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Carolina
with success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf),
Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense to
prepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and
Applewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,
you also had injuries dictate a few starts.



Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the
quarterbacks against Stanford?
Nels Marshall

BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: "Experience. We were in a tight
football game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was proud
- even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that we
didn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job
of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look
like it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too hard
and get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday
night, it is one of those things that you have to grow from."



Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers having
any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a
left-handed or right-handed QB?
Dave Stastny, Austin

BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catching
the ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little
faster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.



Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this year.
What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know
that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they also
apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of
time?
Chad Graham

BROWN:  No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he does
not suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the
window.







[IMAGE]
Jermain Anderson

Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson back
to linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texas
City. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the
necessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be better
suited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the
progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and
Adam Doiron.
Micah Hurt



BROWN:  Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. They
are pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's
instincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop the
run.



Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn
football schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard
Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he has
remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner
fans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging about
the Longhorns.
Barbara and Mark Harper

BROWN:  As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:

Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox
Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 11 a.m. on ABC
Oct. 7 (in Dallas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA
Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA
Oct. 21 (home) vs. Missouri, TBA
Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA
Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA
Nov. 11 at Kansas, TBA
Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas Aat 2:30 p.m. on ABC
Since you all have access to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site
(texassports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your
area. And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at
dallasnews.com.



Q: This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the
number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.
how's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.

BROWN:  The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players in
the NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For
example, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa
Bay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and
Dallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota
Vikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted. Anyway,
here is the list as provided by the Big 12:

TEXAS (21)
Ben Adams, OL, Miami
Taje Allen, DB, St. Louis
Tony Brackens, DE, Jacksonville
Blake Brockermeyer, OG, Chicago
Ricky Brown, RB, Cincinnati
Chris Carter, DB, New England
Kwame Cavil, WR, Buffalo
Phil Dawson, KS, Cleveland
Shane Dronett, DL, Atlanta
Priest Holmes, RB, Baltimore
Aaron Humphrey, DE, Tampa Bay
Jay Humphrey, OL, Minnesota
Derek Lewis, TE, St. Louis
Wane McGarity, WR, Dallas
Eric Metcalf, WR, Carolina
Dan Neil, OL, Denver
Roger Roesler, OL, Cincinnati
Chris Smith, TE, Dallas
Winfred Tubbs, LB, San Francisco
Bryant Westbrook, DB, Detroit
Ricky Williams, RB, New Orleans
Cedric Woodard, DL, Baltimore







[IMAGE]
Hodges Mitchell

Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in your
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometimes
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.

About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible for
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than one,
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of
those yards were "move

the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning the
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.

Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through the
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.

Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY time
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up
with opponent's wideouts.

How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were all
over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What is
up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does
Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Can
anyone at UT block?

Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several times
the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you run
up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll play
against?
Andrew Bowen

BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday's
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.

To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated and
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probably
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams did
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce. If a trend develops,
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question
about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwed
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of the
team.

Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There's
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.

Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it was
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.

Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a couple
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. But
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed to
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That player
has been chewed out every which way.

As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brown,
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't say
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still
have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so
early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss
constructively or destructively.



Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding. I
know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in
the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against
teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. My
question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker
where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized
and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our
recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!
Ernie McAnally

BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first love.
But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the field
right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) is
perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. In
time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But there
is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big plays
against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and
blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season and
the next two years, he should only get better.


Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the
announcers  stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign for
LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky
Williams' run for the Heisman?

BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few
postcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national
media detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than
$10,000, according to UT officials.



Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayette game
play in the Stanford game? I am watching to see which ones might be
redshirts.
Mike Smith, Houston

BROWN:  According to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-Texas
game, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal who
did not play against Louisiana-Lafayette. In addition to Sendlein, here are
the other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson and
Sloan Thomas; TE Brock Edwards; DE Kalen Thornton; CB Nathan Vasher; FS
Phillip Geiggar; and DT Stevie Lee.



Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, his
teams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost
four out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week
officially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his
abundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5
recruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victories
to go with those recruiting victories.
T. Hough

BROWN:  It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship in
stints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At
Appalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead
programs. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with in
the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl games
in his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.

A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas
faithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot
seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he has
done beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A(once) in his
first two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination
school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In
addition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight than
probably most Texas fans realize.

Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd Carr,
Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in the
eyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to that.
UNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,
even when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a school with huge
expectations. He'll have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starting
out the next few seasons in the Top 10.



Q: Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game?
Marty Bonner

BROWN:  Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffered
against Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said
this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball
really well.



Q: Is Ricky Williams' jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game Sept.
30?
Mark Wilson

BROWN:  Yes. Williams' No. 34 will be retired at that game. Williams has
said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend.
Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams that
will be available soon.



Q: What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after
the loss to Stanford?
Virginia Blair

BROWN:  Again, here are Mack's words: "I said during the pre-season that we
were overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished
last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a
Top 5 football team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receive
a tremendous amount of attention and publicity, but in some cases people want
to push you too fast to get to the top. I think that we were in that position
and expectations got out of hand. I knew that we would have a difficult game
at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win. I also didn't think
that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country. Our current rank within
the Top 15 is much more fitting for where we are today."

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


As you may know, we are trying to schedule an interview for Alex Tartakovski
in Houston this week.  I am copying everyone involved because i wont be able
to coordinate this tomorrow.  we just brought our new daughter home today and
my wife is yelling at me to get out of my office.

I just found out that Thursday & Friday are bad days for him, so Wednesday is
the only day to do it this week.  he would come down tuesday night and fly
out wednesday evening.  it's probably easiest for him to arrange his flight,
but he will need a hotel and transportation from the airport.  i gave him
donna's phone number for help. i assume the hyatt would be best.  his home
number is 215-702-3705 and during the day his cellular is 267-981-5425.

by way of background, i plan to bring in 3 people from outside the company to
fill in some of the "vacants" in my group's org chart.  the 3 areas of
specialization that are needed to execute the business plan are (1)
coordination of origination, (2) deal pricing and underwriting, and (3)
modeling and portfolio management.  alex is the perfect person for #3.  he
has the deepest knowledge of probability of anyone i know and is efficient at
building analysis models, which will be a big job in this business because
portfolio management needs to be redefined in real time due to the lumpiness
of insurance contracts and the lack of any historical methods for evaluating
these risks.  development of pricing models will be a joint effort between
"my" group and the research dept because this will need to draw on the
expertise in research as well as being a realtime activity as new deals are
being structured.  i want to encourage joint work between vasant / amitava
and alex because his background and expertise is compatible with research.
over the past 2 years, alex and i spent a lot of time developing new
electricity spot pricing methodology and this is one area where he excels.  i
would expect that he would be a valuable resource in research as well, and so
i would like for him to be able to meet with vince is possible.  (this could
possibly be done when vince is in philadelphia next week if there is time -
(?))  depending on what work needs to be done in the future, i could see him
working both on pricing research and this specific business unit.

i have attached alex's resume.  i assume he would be manager level, but i'm
not sure of this.
this doesnt necessarily come across in the resume, but the skills that are
useful to us are:
probability / statistical model development
development of theoretical pricing methodology
excellent computer programming skills
database development and data analysis
he has the best understanding of the NERC reliability data format outside of
Mike Curley, the NERC data manager.
designed and wrote the code for the pricing model used by Ace Power Products
for deal pricing and porfolio mgmt.
excellent understanding of options pricing methodology and its application to
hedging insurance portfolios.
if you want to get into superconductor trading, he can design the standards.
can beat me at Atari Battlezone (as well as being able to navigate a real
tank through a minefield).

one objective of this meeting in houston is to make him feel comfortable with
the organization (with which you did such a good job for me) and to give him
confidence that he will be able to do state-of-the-art pricing research in
the most innovative company in the world.  he is also interviewing for a job
in morgan stanley's equity dept.

we will also arrange a meeting with Per in NY, but i would like to be in the
office for that, so we can do that next week.

please call me @610-996-2522 if there are any questions.  i may not pick up
but i will reply to voicemail promptly. i'm up 24 hours this week anyway.

thanks,

-- Dave

Fruits Of The Spirit
Max Lucado)

It's quiet. It's early. My coffee is hot. The sky is still black. The
world is still asleep. The day is coming.

In a few moments the day will arrive. It will roar down the track with
the rising of the sun. The stillness of the dawn will be exchanged for the
noise of the day. The calm of the solitude will be replaced by the pounding
pace of the human race. The refuge of the early morning will be invaded by
decisions to be made and deadlines to be met.

For the next twelve hours I will be exposed to the day's demands. It
is now that I must make a choice. Because of Calvary, I'm free to choose.
And so I choose.

I choose love... No occasion justifies hatred; no injustice warrants
bitterness, I choose love. Today I will love God and what God loves.

I choose joy... I will invite my God to be the God of circumstance. I
will refuse the temptation to be cynical...the tool of the lazy thinker. I
will refuse to see people as anything less than human beings, created by
God. I will refuse to see any problem as anything less than an opportunity
to see God.

I choose peace... I will live forgiven. I will forgive so that I may
live.

I choose patience... I will overlook the inconveniences of the world.
Instead of cursing the one who takes my place, I'll invite him to do so.
Rather than complaining that the wait is too long, I will thank God for a
moment to pray. Instead of clinching my fist at new assignments, I will face
them with joy and courage.

I choose kindness... I will be kind to the poor, for they are alone.
Kind to the rich, for they are afraid. And kind to the unkind, for such is
how God has treated me.

I choose goodness... I will go without a dollar before I take a
dishonest one. I will be overlooked before I will boast. I will confess
before I will accuse. I choose goodness.

I choose faithfulness... Today I will keep my promises. My debtors
will not regret their trust. My associates will not question my word. My
wife will not question my love. And my children will never fear that their
father will not come home.

I choose gentleness... Nothing is won by force. I choose to be gentle.
If I raise my voice may it be only in praise. If I clench my fist, may it be
only in prayer. If I make a demand, may it be only of myself.

I choose self-control... I am a spiritual being. After this body is
dead, my spirit will soar. I refuse to let what will rot, rule the eternal.
I choose self-control. I will be drunk only by joy. I will be impassioned
only by my faith. I will be influenced only by God. I will be taught only by
Christ. I choose self-control.

Love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
gentleness, and self-control. To these I commit my day. If I succeed, I will
give thanks. If I fail, I will seek His grace. And then when this day is
done, I will place my head on my pillow and rest. >>

Per Beatty:

1.  Morris is available immediately

2.  Phillips is unavailable until March 5 at the earliest.

3.  Ken Roberts has said to withdraw his name from the list (which saves us
the trouble of striking him).

4.  As previously noted, Webster has been withdrawn by Duke and Paul has
been withdrawn too (Beatty says it is because he has been picked by Duke as
their party arbitrator in another matter-- which shows how Renfrew was
trying to screw us).

Beatty suggests Jim Coleman of Carrington Coleman as a possibility.  I do
not know him.

He also suggests L. K. Smith of Oklahoma as a possibility.  I don't know him
either.

Renfrew pressed Beatty to agree to someone by this Monday (same speech Smith
had given me).  Beatty demurred.  Renfrew is still out of the country  and
will be until the 22nd of January.

For scheduling purposes, be advised I have just been re-set for trial in
another case on February 26, so we need to avoid that week for the hearing.

We still need to press forward on the witness interviews and witness
preparations.  Where do we stand on getting access to some or all of them?

Let's have a conference call when convenient for you, Richard.  Thanks.

Some corrections to the write-up for the first one for EES, some attribtuon
changes (I think) and an additional valuation for EES.  Also, includes
changes to the write-ups for ENA and what I got from Tim Belden.  I also have
a note discussing Tim Belden's "philosophy" in giving me valuations.

EES

RAP '98
Enron raised the issue of the UDCs imposing an artificial cap on the PX
credit for direct customers during the very first proceedings during which
the method of CTC collection was raised.  The CPUC shined us on. Later, we
raised it in the very first Revenue Adjustment Proceeding (RAP '98) RAP '98
and ensured that it became part of WPTF's case as well.  The way the "cap"
worked, the UDCs would not pay ESPs the full PX credit when prices were high
-- they would pay a credit that, when added to the other bill components, did
not exceed the frozen rate for the direct access customer, thereby costing
ESPs a lot of  money  potentially.  It was clear in the previous CPUC direct
access decisions that UDCs had no right to cap direct access credits. Because
of our good case and the fact that the UDCs believed the chance of such high
PX prices was LOW, the UDCs settled on this issue in 1999.

2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $30 - 40 million
% Attributed to Enron's GA Efforts: 90%

Green Credit Legislation
Enron and other green suppliers began work in 1998 to extend the credit given
for sales of green power. The credit was scheduled to end by 2002. In 1999,
the money specified in AB 1890 was being depleted rapidly and Green Mountain
took the lead in pressing for legislation. We actively supported Green
Mountain by lobbying legislators and other interest groups, working with
environmental organisations, and spearheading legislative amendments.
Although this bill became wrapped up in the San Diego crisis and ISO/PX
issues, the green credit portion of the bill remained intact.  We had also
decided jointly to propose a ten-year credit and were very pleased and
surprised that it survived into the final bill.  Governor Davis is expected
to sign the bill.

2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $50 million
% Attributed to Enron's GA Efforts: 25%

RAP '99
Enron, through ARM, has successfully made its case that retail procurement
and retail sales costs should be removed from the Distribution Charge that
all customers pay.  Direct Access customers would receive a credit on their
bills in addition to the PX credit. Enron was the first party to raise these
issues as part of RAP '98 and got a Commission decision in that case to
determine the credit in RAP '99.  In RAP '99, Enron chose to use ARM to
litigate the case as a cheaper alternative.  Hearings were completed in the
Spring of 2000.  ARM has negotiated settlement rates with certain parties and
has convinced the Assigned Commissioner to draft his own decision to
counteract the unfavorable ALJ decision. An additional credit of from $0.25
to $0.30/MWh is expected.  The decision will be voted out within the next two
months.

2000 NPV estimated by Dennis Benevides: $1 - 5 million
% Attributed to Enron's GA Efforts: 75%

San Diego Marketing
Government Affairs worked closely with EES origination to help the staff
understand the wildly fluctuating regulatory and political arena in San Diego
and to assist its efforts to take advantage of the unique marketing
opportunity afforded by volatile wholesale market prices.  EES created a new
Enron milestone.  Beginning at a point with no personnel working on San Diego
deals, EES moved in and was able to sign deals worth $1 million in three
weeks time.  EES has received kudos from the highest levels of Enron for this
effort, which continues today.  Martin Wenzel and Doug Condon of EES
origination have stated their belief that these deals would not have happened
with the assistance of Government Affairs.

2000 NPV estimated by Doug Condon: $1 million and growing
% Attributed to Enron's  GA Efforts: 90%


ENA

Note:  Tim Belden, VP West Trading Desk, discussed with me how these
valuations would be used.  He found it difficult to assess Gov Affairs'
contribution to the ENA dollars made.  In the end, he settled on the concept
that Government Affairs works, sometimes for years, to present ENA with an
opportunity to make money and then it is up to ENA to run with it.  So, the
value Tim provides is the value ENA made with the opportunity.  I think this
is consistent with the way Dennis Benevides calculated the value for me.


FTR Release April 1, 2000
I have spearheaded the release of firm transmission rights in CA since I
joined the Company in 11/96.  When I joined Enron, the plan of market
participants was to have financial-only rights.  I began working immediately
to move people in the direction of physical rights. A very long and painful
fight ensued, including a number of personal appearances by Bill Hogan. This
culminated with an ISO decision to have physical-type FTRs and to release
some, but not all, FTRs in April of this year.  ENA actively participated in
the auction and became the largest single purchaser of FTRs.  The new
congestion management approach, which Enron also spearheaded, will require
100% release of FTRs, but will not take effect until next year. This
valuation looks only at the FTR release in 2000.

2000 NPV estimated by Tim Belden: $20 million
% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 90%


ISO Price Caps
Price caps have been discussed in California beginning a few days after the
market opened in April 1998.  Over the course of the last two years,
Government Affairs had as a number one priority to provide rapid advance
information on price caps, educate Board members on the effects of price
caps, and, when appropriate, work to move price caps.  By June, 2000, ENA had
a substantial long position in the market in the West and had millions at
risk when lower price caps began to be discussed in CA in mid June.
Government Affairs, working with Dave Parquet and others, was instrumental in
delaying the movement to lower price caps by six weeks, thereby giving ENA
time to move out of those positions in an orderly fashion .  The following
events happened in 2000.  We entered the year with a price cap of $750,
having fought to raise it to that level in 1999.  In March 2000, the ISO
considered lowering the price cap to $500 but voted to leave it at $500,
because the Board believed at the time that market power had been adequately
mitigated.  After the three very high-priced days in June, the ISO considered
lowering the price cap to $250 with a vote on June 22. Government Affairs
initiated an all-out lobbying effort to convince Board members and their
constituents to oppose lower price caps.  We also lobbied interest groups,
banks, venture capitalists, NYMEX and others to weigh in on this issue with
individual Board Members and the Board itself, going so far as to set up a
special arrangement with the ISO staff to allow interested parties to address
the Board telephonically.  The vote on June 22 failed by ONE VOTE. Instead,
the Board lowered the price cap to $500.  The Board voted again on July 1 to
lower the cap and again the vote failed by ONE VOTE.  Finally, on August 1,
the Board approved the $250 price cap, effective August 7.  In the end, it
was the end-use customers, Enron and the generators who opposed price caps.
Utilities and munis favored them. Enron was the only party lobbying against
the lower price caps (the generators gave up early in the fight) and had
significant credibility with the end-use customer reps on the Board.

The ISO recently held Board elections for the first time.  Government Affairs
actively sought market-oriented individuals to run for the Board and replace
those that do not support competitive markets.  Enron was successful in
getting about five to run.  The Members selected or confirmed by the EOB have
been held up and we do not yet know the outcome of those Board seats.
However, one seat of interest has been decided.  Dave Parquet suggested a
potential municipal representative who was extremely market-oriented (Michael
Wood, Attorney for the City of Pittsburgh).  Government Affairs worked with
him closely to decide which seat to run for, help him prepare his
application, suggest lobbying tactics, assist in lobbying and support him
with other Board Members.  He won the election and became a Board Member in
early September.  This effort is significant, because the munis voted nearly
100% in support of lower price caps. The position he took was one of those
votes.  All other things being equal, we have now added a vote on our side
that could be instrumental in defeating further efforts to impose lower or
additional price caps, given the close votes that have taken place thus far.

2000 NPV: Tim did not feel this is measurable at this time, but agreed it
could be worth millions if future votes are as close as they have been
% Attributed to Enron's Efforts: 100%

Brothers,

Keep the messages coming. Your messages are laugh out loud  funny. My wife
wishes she were a Beta and could get in on the fun  to. For example, in
response to our selection of Lakewood Landing for  Thursday night- Jim Dent
writes:

Beek:

"I regret to inform you  that the Lakewood Landing is a gay bar. Looks like
some of the brothers will  have to go in drag. Get it, Elvis."

Brother Del  Dent

I sent this message to Tom Benson and he  responded:

"No wonder everyone was so  friendly! That explains the bathrooms being
marked "shipping" and  "receiving" ."

Tom

Shortly thereafter, I get a message (Anderson, you're  gunna like this) from
Bill Jansson:
"There is no problem so large,that it can not be overcome by  the use of
high-explosives." LTjg Bill Jansson,USN-1983

Bill also included the a photograph. (see  attached).

Another source of great entertainment was the copy from  the SMU Alumni
On-line Newsletter that John Miller circulated. I couldn't  help suspecting
the influence of the Drow factor. I hope the responsible  party will humbly
step forward and receive the clicks due him for such a  creative and humorous
piece of writing that captured the essence of a 'Gamma  Omega' Beta.

Many clicks,
BEEK

Rob Marvin of Inside FERC called for Mary Kay today with a couple questions.
I reviewed them with Mary Kay and reported back to him.  He wanted to know
what "Settlement Amount" and "Net Settlement Payment Due" meant on the
schedules.  I told him "Settlement Amount" was the Kansas ad valorem tax
refund obligation due under the Settlement, and that the "Net Settlement
Payment Due" was what was remaining due if the producer had already paid
money to Northern.  He then asked how the "Settlement Amount" was calculated
and I told him that was subject to settlement negotiation privilege and that
the parties agreed not to disclose any calculations or formulas in the
Settlement.  Jrt

Aneela Charania to take all pieces of paperwork and make sure they get to the
right person.  I spoke with Mike Bruegel at Bear (312) 663-3253 and I think
he fully understands what we are trying to do, which is simply to sell these
shares and move the cash out of the account once the trade is settled.  I
also told him the account will not stay open once the trade is done.
Obviously this is what is causing BS heartburn since they want more business,
and if it weren't for the fact that BS is the investment banker, we would not
be using BS at all.  We would go with the existing account with Morgan

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


At our last meeting, we identified several impediments to participating in
the aggregation programs in Northeast Ohio.  They included the uncertainty of
the shopping credit and the requirement for load following on 500-600
megawatts of capacity in Cleveland and possibly 2000 megawatts in Norheast
Ohio, where we have no generating capacity and no pool exists.  At the
conclusion of the meeting, we decided to try and find out if there are other
serious non-Ohio affiliated bidders out there before we took more aggressive
measures on why municipal aggregation doesn't work.

I have spoken to George Pofok at Cleveland Public Power who stated that he
has spoken to 12 power marketers and 1 power broker.  He has received a
number of bids below the shopping credit from suppliers who are both
affiliates and nonaffiliates.  He said that about three or four of the
bidders have voiced concerns about getting firm transmission service into
FE.  (Once the power reaches FE, under the Ohio settlement, they will treat
it like their own native load).  An equal number of marketers have also
expressed concern about the load following issue. Pofok's view is that
without generation in the region, it will be difficult to play in this
market.  He noted that in 3-4 years, Orion will be a major player once the
buy-back is completed.  Further, he believes that the problem is not as much
one of insufficient generation as it is of insufficient transmission and that
"paper solutions" will not solve the problem.  Jeff and I will be meeting
with him to discuss transmission issues.  (Pofok is also Chairman of the
Board of Amp-Oh).

Our competitors who are proposing/building capacity in Ohio include:
Cogentrix, Dominion, DPL Energy, Dresden, Duke, Entergy, Ohio National Energy
and  PG&E National Energy Group.

With regard to aggregation in FE service territory, I see three options which
are as follows:

1.  Do not compete in that market for aggregated load
2.  Reconsider building generating capacity in the FE service territory
3.  Bid on aggregation and take the risk for balancing or sign a network
operating agreement

With respect to the third option, preliminarily, it appears that under FE's
regs, if you don't have power within a control area's control, you have to
sign a network agreement.  I am in the process of obtaining that agreement to
see if that gets us over the hurdle, since if we signed the network
agreement, we would not have to worry about load following, (depending of
course on the price).  Point to point is only available to retail customers
taking service at 69 kv and above.

The other point with regard to balancing is that under the FE settlement, as
long as the system is balanced within 88 MW, there is no penalty,  A payment
of the cost to the utility would be required if the system was out of balance
by more than 88MW (based on FE's L-sub 10 limit) and our contribution to the
system was in the same direction as the imbalance.  Cash out is at market
price  with no penalties.  Market price is calculated as the incremental cost
to FE to buy the power if we are short or the sale price if we are long.
Penalties attach if there is a pattern of frequently being out of balance.
Under the FE agreement, we would schedule a day ahead but could change that
schedule up to twenty minutes before each hour which should help manage the
risk of getting into an imbalance situation.  This is very close to how we
managed the deal we did behind Duquesne.

One other issue I am looking into is ancillary services.  It appears in the
Alliance RTO filing that the intention is to require suppliers to pay for
ancillary services associated with retail services whereas the utilities
would not.  In the FE supplier tariffs, it indicates we must pay for
transmission and ancillaries, but in the retail tariffs unbundling service,
the transmission and ancillary charges are broken out and appear to be
included in the cost the customer pays the utility (minus the shopping
credit).  I asked Rick Hornsby of Tabors and Associates to look at this to
see if there is a double counting or an argument that could be made to keep
suppliers and customers from paying the same charge twice.  He concurred that
there appears to be a double counting.  I have written up an argument on this
which is being included in a pleading we are filing today and am also talking
to staffers about it.  This would improve the economics of any aggregation
deal we might do.

As soon as I get the network agreement, I will let you know.  Please let me
know your thoughts about how we ought to proceed.

Janine

As discussed, given Joe's comments below, a note to confirm that this being
dealt with internally.

Rob Soeldner has made it clear to Joe that:

Enron places great importance on trading controls. These are non-negotiatable.
The suggested course of action is not an option
We aren't seeking to close any of the Agency offices given implemetation of
these controls.

Joe is not in yet - Rob will be discussing with him further when the US gets
in.

Of note - Joe is on the commercial side,  Marcelo Parra who is responsible
for the operational side is fully onboard for the operational changes made.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


To All EMSA students,

Attached are two versions (Word and Power Point) of a flier regarding the
Enron Informational Meeting next Tuesday (September 19th).

As the flier states, Mike McConnell, an OU graduate and a graduate of this
program (formerly known as PLM), will be the main speaker. Mike is a former
landman and is a very dynamic speaker. Mike recently assumed the position of
President and CEO of Enron Global Markets, L.L.C.. Though many of you have
heard him before. Mike has a completely new and exciting power point
presentation he will give. Not only will he talk about new things going on
at Enron and in the energy business, he will also discuss what is going on
in Exploration & Production too. It is my understanding he will also give a
fascinating demonstration about Enron On-Line ( Enron's revolutionary idea
that has completely changed the way gas and other commodities are now
traded).

I realize many of you have night classes (i.e.. Oil and Gas Law, etc) and
cannot miss it. However, you need to plan on attending the social, after
class, at Coach's. Jody Crook, Sally Beck (Vice President of Energy
Operations) and  Lexi Elliott (Enron's new college recruiter) will be here,
along with other Enron representatives, to meet and visit with you about
career opportunities with Enron and discuss questions you might have about
the energy industry in general.

Also, Enron will have a booth at the Career Fair the following day
(Wednesday, Sept. 20th). You should also plan on going to that and visiting
with them and the other companies that will also be on campus to look at EM
students too. This will give you a good comparison of what type of
opportunities that are out there and to compare the management styles of
each of these companies. I know that Enron invites comparison, as they have
obviously been very successful with their style.

Again, I expect all of you that do not have class conflicts, or try to make
arrangements to have someone cover for your class,  to attend all or at
least the social part of this presentation. Needless to say, Enron, and
especially Mike McConnell, are taking the time and expense to come up and
visit with you and to look at this program. It was this program and both Ms.
Beck's and Mr. McConnell's support, that first brought Enron to OU. We need
to make the same type of commitment to them and show them how much we
appreciate Enron's support of our program and the hiring of OU students. The
new "Participation Point  Policy" will be in effect for this and attendance
and non-excused absences will be noted.

For your information, this week is the week to sign up for Enron interviews,
through the Career Services website. Enron is scheduled to be here on
Monday, October 9th for first round interviews. If you make it to the second
round, those will take place on Tuesday, October 10th. So be aware of your
schedule to allow for interview times for both Monday and possible Tuesday
when interviewing with Enron.

Should you have any questions, or have problems opening these attachments,
please let me know.

See you at the EMSA meeting on Sunday night (e-mail coming) and next week at
"An Evening with Enron".

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I have asked ENA's Compensation team within HR to conduct a compensation
study for me for all positions from Manager level through Vice President.
This analysis will include employees who are dedicated to ENA, EIM and EGM.

It had been the plan to complete our compensation analysis by focusing on the
Manager level and above, following the market analysis for Senior Specialists
and below that was completed by Yvonne Land.  I learned recently that Yvonne
has left the Company and that she had not begun the analysis for Managers and
above.

Todd Burke, who recently joined Enron, will be conducting the market survey
and compensation analysis.  I met with Todd recently.  He has had wonderful
experience with Towers Perin and Watson Wyatt, and I feel that we are
fortunate to have him devoted to this project.  Please give sufficient
thought and attention to requests from Todd.  The quality and timeliness of
your responses will directly impact the quality and timeliness of the
analysis that I will receive from Todd.  I think that you should each have a
vested interest in the success of this project!

Todd also plans to resurvey market information for Senior Specialists and
below so that his view of compensation will be complete and timely for all of
Energy Operations.  Since we recently took action on compensation levels for
key players at the Senior Specialist level and below, I would not anticipate
further adjustments for those levels as a result of Todd's review.

You should receive a message from Todd in the next day or so in which he will
detail steps in the compensation analysis and what your role will be.

Imbalances:
I would like us to continue to pursue Channel/ El Paso/ Tenngasco for our
payback.  They got our cashout number last week, where do they stand.
Again,  I think Robert is an ally and I do not want to irritate him but
things will not get any better in the future.  We need to resolve this
imbalance.  Can we net some  of these contracts?
I like Mary Poorman's report; however I have questions:
How can we miss black marlin so completely?  do we agree with this imbalance?
Can we net all the Chevron and Dynegi contracts together for payback to
Keith once we get the AR issue solved?
Where do we stand on the Columbia Energy resolution?
Where do we stand on the NGPL reconcilliation?
Duke Energy 206 is still a problem.
Do we need all these Amoco contracts they have 8, that seems like a large
number to me, can we net some of them?
Are we charging enough for the swing we get at the paper plant on the Entex
contract?
Is there a way to keep Tejas in line at Southern Union this winter?  That
meter will really swing then and I do not know how much line pack they have
the  right to use.
Can we net the Corpus Christi gas marketing and all the Tejas/ Coral/Gulf
Energy/Shell imbalances down?  How is the reconcillitation going?
Can we smash the Entex and the Reliant contracts together so we can get rid
of some of these contracts?  They have 9, that seems like a lot to me.
Gulfmark is gone down the road can we check with someone about this
contract, it seems like we should be able to net these volumes against some
where we are owed?
Is this Lone Star 213 imbalance real, if so how do we resolve?
Where did the Exxon imbalance come from?
Do we need 5 Texaco transportation contracts, can we get rid of some?
Can we combine the Vastar and the Southern imbalances?
What is the Webb/Duval do, can we get rid of it, combine this with Midcon,
how old is this imbalnce?

Mick update the compressor fuel on the P/L but the new numbers do not seem to
translate up to the profit calculation?  Can we do something about this?
I thought the imbalance report I got this Wed was pretty sad.  Some of the
columns did not add and there seemed to be a lot of missing information.  Can
we resolve this?
I am concerned about our capacity positons in the future, we are going to
have to work on a better way to check our positions.
I had a meeting with Tom Shelton and our representative to the RRC, James
Mann, the RRC is concerned about this winter and they have asked us to
compile a list of customers we will cut based upon the priority we filed with
the RRC several years ago.  Lauri will have a copy of the priority list.  We
need to compile this list and get Tom and James comfortable with the
process.  The last thing we need is the RRC hammering on us, when can we get
this list?  I think we should be able to get something out of the contract
system.  Jackie Morgan is who I would approach.

Richard, issues to consider before Faye makes any changes,
*  NFUL is an EDI pipeline, how will the changes impact Angie's EDI file?

Good  morning Sarah and Jackie.

Do we  now have an agreement on the PrimeTrade access agreement ? If yes
could  you fax it to me @ 603-250-4916.
This  will then allow us to focus on the clearing docs. Please note that
these  clearing docs are signed by a large number of
international/supranational  organizations as well as US government agencies.
As such they should not  represent any difficulties and should not be
contentious.
Thanks  for the list of traders received yesterday, I will start the process
of getting  them logins
as  soon as the documents are signed and the software installed I plan to
fly  toHouston and train everybody.


PS  Ellen could you give me the name of the person who will install the CD I
sent  you on your network...he should contact my IT colleague Mr. Sachin
Joshi  212-325-8926 & sachin.joshi@csfb.com

David,

The business model you outline is actually the one we are implementing with
one big difference - the Head Trader in London (Sam Hainsworth) calls the
sales person each day to tell him what to do before they speak to any
customers. As you point out, these conversations are recorded so if the sales
person does anything other than what is agreed at the outset of each day,
then they will be red carded.

I refer you back to the memo supplementing the updated list of authorised
traders that I sent out and which Marcelo and Sam have discussed with
Commercial staff in both these offices (Shona and Bjorn have this memo), as
well as Marcelo's operational plan.

Clarification point - when Andy says "internally" he means that Commercial
(Rob Soeldner) is taking a lead in resolving Joe Robertson's concerns.

Tim

I had a conversation yesterday with Brian Fitzgerald, local counsel in CT,
regarding the LighTrade issue.  He informed me that LighTrade has been
successful thus far in its argument that it should not be regulated by the
DPUC due to its intent:  LighTrade does not intend to provide the actual
bandwidth to customers.  Instead, it wants to establish connections between
various points as a service to those companies that sell bandwidth.  Brian
has offered to monitor this issue for us.  I told him that we would let him
know if we wanted him to do that.
Additionally, please use this link to access the LighTrade petition and other

News from Los Angeles in the Los Angeles Times
Riordan to Join L.A. Unified After He Leaves City Hall
<<...>> Mayor: In an address to Valley leaders, he strongly denounces
secession, then makes surprising disclosure about plan to take executive
post with district.
By JIM NEWTON, Times Staff Writer
In his final annual address on the state of the San Fernando Valley, Los
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan on Friday delivered his most forceful call
ever for that area to remain part of the larger city, then surprised the
audience by announcing that he will go to work for the Los Angeles Unified
School District when he finishes his term in office.
Speaking to a group of Valley business leaders, Riordan denounced secession
on political, moral and practical grounds, warning that it would force a tax
hike, leave the Valley with uncertain leadership and abandon the city's
poor.
"I love the Valley," Riordan said. "I feel that you're part of the family,
and I don't want you to desert the family. . . . The rest of the city needs
you. You can't abandon the poor. It just isn't right."
Riordan's pointed rejection of secession represents a significant escalation
in his efforts to head off that politically charged prospect--a topic so
heated that in a mayoral debate following Riordan's speech, not one of the
six candidates angling for election in April so much as mentioned the word.
Riordan, by contrast, tackled the issue head-on and in far more
confrontational terms than he ever has before.
"Secession," Riordan said bluntly, "is a lousy idea."
As significant as that pronouncement was, however, the mayor almost
overshadowed it with an offhand personal remark in response to a question
after his speech. Asked to elaborate on his thoughts about breaking up the
school district, Riordan let slip that he intends to go to work for L.A.
Unified after he finishes his second term as mayor, which ends next summer.
The mayor, who helped elect four of the school board's seven members, said
he has been in discussions with Supt. Roy Romer and has agreed to accept an
"executive position" with the district next year. Riordan did not elaborate,
but in an interview later, he said he and the superintendent had agreed that
Riordan would run the district's classroom computer program.
The former Colorado governor, who now runs the city's schools, was not
immediately available for comment.
At the district, Riordan said, he will be in charge of working with schools
to make effective use of computers in the classroom. Riordan, who has
donated thousands of computers to schools in various parts of the country,
said the job fit his talents. "I think this is something I'm good at," he
said. "I know the experts in the field."
Riordan's post-mayoral plans have for months been the object of much
speculation. Most observers predicted he would do something in the field of
education, because no topic animates Riordan as much as children and
schools.
But Riordan is a multimillionaire, and he will be over 70 when he finishes
his second term as mayor. He passed up the chance to run for governor in
1998, and some friends had predicted he would slow down when he wrapped up
his mayoral administration.
The idea of a quiet retirement, however, seems to have little appeal for
Riordan, an energetic and restless man. Asked how long he intended to take
off between finishing his work as mayor and starting his new job at the
school district, Riordan responded: "three or four hours."
Riordan has held office for nearly eight years, and for that entire time has
enjoyed the strong support of the San Fernando Valley. It was the Valley
that helped put him in office in 1993, and polls since have shown that
though he is popular citywide, he enjoys his greatest approval ratings north
of the Hollywood Hills.
As the race to succeed him gathers steam, some of the candidates clearly
covet Riordan's base in the Valley.
On Friday, City Councilman Joel Wachs often invoked the mayor's name during
a low-energy debate among the six leading mayoral candidates. Among other
things, Wachs praised Riordan's economic development initiatives and his
handling of the recently completed negotiations between the city and federal
government over the future of the Los Angeles Police Department.
So effusive was Wachs in his praise of Riordan that eventually businessman
Steve Soboroff complained. As Soboroff pointed out to the audience, Riordan
has endorsed his candidacy, not Wachs'. Soboroff suggested that his rival
withdraw from the race and back him instead.
Wachs laughed, but did not respond.
The debate--really more of a panel discussion in which the candidates rarely
addressed one another, while sitting cheek-by-jowl in straight-backed
chairs--also was notable as the first joint appearance of the candidates to
include state Controller Kathleen Connell, the latest contender to join the
race.
Connell used her debut debate performance to stress her determination to
bring tough fiscal management to the problems of Los Angeles. She addressed
issues such as police corruption, transportation and the city's business
climate in terms of their economic impact, arguing that her experience in
the private sector and as controller made her the right person to handle
that task.
In other debate highlights, City Atty. James Hahn and Assemblyman Antonio
Villaraigosa enthusiastically welcomed the signing of the consent decree
with the federal government on police reform.
Connell, Wachs and U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra also applauded the deal, though
in less glowing terms.
Soboroff was the only candidate to oppose it, calling it an abdication of
local responsibility.

FYI.  How to remedy the "PX only" flaw in California's market has been on the
table for some time.  I've felt for some time that the gas model offers a
good point of departure for coming up with a more rationale alternative to
the current framework.
As mentioned in a previous note, I made that point at the California Energy
Market conference last week.  The EOB's chief economic consultant, who also
spoke at the conference, was intrigued by my comments and has asked me to go
up to Sacramento sometime in the next week or two to discuss it--and other
options--with him.
My understanding is that the idea coincidentally got some attention at the
Wright meeting last week.  With all of that in mind, I wanted to pass on a
very brief summary of the gas procurement mechanisms currently in place for
PG&E and SoCalGas that I asked Mike Day's shop to draft up last month.  It
might come in handy as prep for the call on Monday to discuss the Wright
meeting.

To All,

A hard copy of the following crime alert was delivered by UCPD with the
request to send it to everyone.

STRONG ARM ROBBERY
Central Campus

"On Sunday, September 17, 2000 at about 9:00 p.m., a strong arm robbery
occurred on the Esplanade between Sather Tower and Doe Library on the
Berkeley campus.

The victim was an 18 year old male UCB student.  he was walking from the
Unit III Residence Halls to Doe Library when he was approached by 5-6
individuals.  Suspect #1 asked, 'Where is Building 1B?'  The victim replied
that he did not know.  As the victim backed away, Suspect #1 hit him on the
right side of his face and knocked him to the ground.  The victim felt his
backpack being pulled away and grabbed for it, but was knocked down
again.  The victim saw the other suspects approaching, so he released his
backpack and ran into Doe Library to report the crime.  A witness saw the
crime occur and said the suspects fled in a southeast direction towards
Stephens Hall.  The victim received scrapes and bruises, but was not
seriously hurt.  His backpack and contents were taken.

The robbers were all described as African-American men:
#1 was 17-29 years old, about 5'-9" tall, about 140 pounds, thin build,
black hair in cornrowed cut, goatee, wearing a black t-shirt with white
lettering and black pants.
#2 and #3 were 17-29 years old, medium height and weight, black hair,
wearing white 5-shirts.
#4 and #5 were 17-29 years old, medium height and medium build, black hair,
wearing dark t-shirts.

Anyone with information about this case should immediately call the
University of California Police Department Detective Kenneth Moody (510)
642-3184.

As with any emergency situation, if you see suspicious activity, call
9-911, from a campus phone."

We wish him the very best in his new venture and want to send him off with
all the "good" wishes and support that he deserves.  However, since I
will be out of town all next week,  we will postone the "Good Luck and
Best Wishes" party for Grant until sometime within the next 3 weeks.  An
announcement will be forthcoming at a later date.

Please take a minute to wish Grant the "Best".

Sincerely,

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I had a voice message from Mike Beatty this weekend advising as follows:

Mike received a call from Renfrew from somewhere in Latin America.  Renfrew
proposed as the neutral arbitrator one of the following:

1.  Joe Morris (ex fed. d. ct. judge and former GC of Shell)

2.  Ken Roberts  (ex GC of Exxon)

3.  Bill Paul  (ex GC Phillips and recently former ABA President)

4.  Bill Webster (Milbank Tweed in DC; ex Fed. Ct App judge, ex FBI
director, ex CIA director)

5.  Layne Phillips (ex fed ct judge in OK City, now at Irell & Manella)

Beatty did not say in his message whether these people had said they were
willing to serve or whether Renfrew was just throwing out some names.

It is an impressive list, obviously.

Beatty wants me to call back (I was unable to reach him this weekend) to
discuss our reaction to these names and who we might want to counterpropose
if none of these is acceptable.

Renfrew undoubtedly knows all of these people.  Each of them is either a
former judge, as is Renfrew, or a former Big Oil CEO, as is Renfrew.

Beatty mentioned that Joe Morris was a good friend of Beatty's.  He did not
say what his relationship was with the others.

Our firm has been adverse to most big oil companies, including Exxon, Shell
and Phillips.

I do not know any of them except Judge Webster.  He is a personal friend of
my wife, who served as his personal Special Counsel at both the FBI and CIA.
Earlier this year, when I was hired to handle a case in which the three
neutral arbitrators already had been selected, Webster (who was one of them)
disclosed (at my request) his relationship with Nancy and me, stating that
he did not view it as a problem but asking the other parties to advise
whether they wanted him to recuse himself.  None did.  Obviously, if he is
someone we wanted to consent to we would need to advise Duke of the
relationship and see if it made them change their mind.

Let's talk soon about how we should respond.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


As all of you know, Diane, Douglas, George, Rick and myself have been engaged
in trying to identify a person who we might prefer to Bob Pickel as CEO
designate of ISDA.

This, as expected, has been a challenging task. Recognising Bob's strenghths,
it was felt that we should focus the search on identifying someone whose was
wanting to do the role emphatically for reasons other than its intrinsic
financial compensation. We hired an executive search Firm to assist us.  A
number of candidate lists were vetted by the Group and more than 50 calls
were made. A number of people were interviewed. But we have not been
successful.

At this time I believe the prospects of our finding someone who would
contribute more than Bob for the range of compensation we are offering is
small relative to the risk to the Association of waiting longer to nominate
Bob.

I have myself spent quite some time with Bob these last two months and I am
very confident he will make an excellent CEO. I sat down with him last week -
just to be sure he has the right degree of interest - and this opinion was
re-inforced.

It is the view of those of us who have been specifically engaged in this
process - Diane, Douglas, George, Rick and myself - that we recommend to the
Board that Bob be appointed CEO designate. I have spoken to a number of you
last month while in the Far East on this topic. I will be proposing this to
the Board next week - and there will if necessary be time to discuss it - but
I would like to know in advance please if there are any of you who hold a
different view.

Hi Everyone,

I just spoke with Joe Edwards about interconnection agreements with ILECs in
states where we have CLEC authority.  Joe was very appreciative of having our
group take the lead on this issue.  We'll be providing guidance in
understanding how these agreements work, identifying the best starting point
for negotiation and then participating in the negotiations along with Joe's
group.

Joe would like to see copies of the sample PacBell agreements that we have
for California.  He also is interested in seeing agreements for SBC in Texas,
Verizon in NY and NJ, and US West in Oregon.

Donald:  I'm hoping you will lead this effort.  Can you give me a call to
talk about how we should approach it?

Jeff:  Can you send Joe the disc you forwarded to Scott, Donald and I a while
ago for California?

Marchris and Margo:  Can you get copies of interconnection agreements SBC has
signed in Texas?

Margo:  When you talk to Andrew Fischer this afternoon, can you ask him for
copies of interconnection agreements that Verizon has signed in New York?

Thanks,

Sue

SIPPING VODKA
A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly
speak. After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done.
The monsignor replied, "When I am worried about getting nervous
on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka next to the water
glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."
So next Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning
of the sermon, he got nervous and took a drink.  He
proceeded to talk up a storm. Upon his return to his office after mass, he
found the following note on the door:

1.  Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2.  There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3.  There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4.  Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5.  Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6.  We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7.  The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not
referred to as daddy, junior, and the spook.
8.  David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9.  When David was hit by a rock and knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he
said,"Take this and eat it for it is my body."  He did not
say, Eat me"
12.  The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry,"
13.  The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub
thanks for the grub, yeah God.
14.  Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at
St.Peter's, not a peter pulling contest at St.Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings
good luck to everyone who passes it on.  The one who breaks the
chain will have bad luck. Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.
Just forward it to five of your friends to whom you wish good luck.  You
will  see that something good happens to you four days from now if the chain
is not broken.

please everyone..."

Gentlemen,

I recommend that we purchase this package and split the cost 3 ways between 3

I think that we should go for option 3 (~ $15,000).

Lance Cunningham in my group looked at this software package and found it
very useful for modeling transmission problems.
Please, feel free to ask him for technical details in support of this
recommendation.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


We met with Gov Davis on Thursday evening in LA.  In attendance were Ken Lay,
the Governor, the Governor's staff director (Kari Dohn) and myself.  The gov.
spent over an hour and a half with us covering our suggestions and his
ideas.  He would like some additional thoughts from us by Tuesday of next
week as he prepares his state of the state address for the following Monday.
Attached to the end of this memo is a list of solutions we proposed (based on
my discussions with several of you) as well as some background materials Jeff
Dasovich and I prepared.  Below are my notes from the meeting regarding our
proposals, the governor's ideas, as well as my overview of the situation
based on the governor's comments:
Overview:   We made great progress in both ensuring that he understands that
we are different from the generators and in opening a channel for ongoing
communication with his administration. The gov does not want the utilities to
go bankrupt and seems predisposed to both rate relief (more modest than what
the utilities are looking for) and credit guarantees.  His staff has more
work to do on the latter, but he was clearly intrigued with the idea.  He
talked mainly in terms of raising rates but not uncapping them at the retail
level.  He also wants to use what generation he has control over for the
benefit of California consumers, including utility-owned generation (which he
would dedicate to consumers on a cost-plus basis) and excess muni power
(which he estimates at 3000MW).  He foresees a mix of market oriented
solutions as well as interventionist solutions which will allow him to fix
the problem by '02 and provide some political cover.
Our proposals:  I have attached the outline we put in front of him (it also
included the forward price information several of you provided).  He seemed
interested in 1) the buy down of significant demand, 2) the state setting a
goal of x000 MW of new generation by a date certain, 3) getting the utilities
to gradually buy more power forward and 4) setting up a group of rate
analysts and other "nonadvocates" to develop solutions to a number of issues
including designing the portfolio and forward purchase terms for utilities.
He was also quite interested in examining the incentives surrounding LDC gas
purchases.   As already mentioned, he was also favorably disposed to finding
some state sponsored credit support for the utilities.
His ideas:  The gov read from a list of ideas some of which were obviously
under serious consideration and some of which were mere "brainstorming".
Some of these ideas would require legislative action.
State may build (or make build/transfer arrangements) a "couple" of
generation plants.  The gov feels strongly that he has to show consumers that
they are getting something in return for bearing some rate increases.  This
was a frequently recurring theme.
Utilities would sell the output from generation they still own on a cost-plus
basis to consumers.
Municipal utilties would be required to sell their excess generation in
California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more
widely deploy distributed generation.
Expand in-state gas production.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for
addtional gas supplies.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power plant
maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of service at
any one time.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term in state.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be
able to help out here).
Wants to condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.  We made
some headway with the idea that he could instead require utilities to buy
some portion of their forward requirements from new in-state generation
thereby accomplishing the same thing without using a command and control
approach with generators.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
To dos: (Jeff, again I'd like to prevail on you to assemble the group's
thoughts and get them to Kari)
He wants to see 5 year fixed power prices for peak/ off-peak and baseload --
not just the 5 one year strips.
He wants comments on his proposals by Tuesday.
He would like thoughts on how to pitch what consumers are getting out of the
deal.
He wants to assemble a group of energy gurus to help sort through some of the
forward contracting issues.
Thanks to everyone for their help.  We made some progress today.

The New Power Company Challenges Green Mountain Energy

10/30/2000
PR Newswire
(Copyright (c) 2000, PR Newswire)

GREENWICH, Conn., Oct. 30 /PRNewswire/ -- The New Power Company (NYSE: NPW)
characterized as "completely false" the October 23 contention of Green
Mountain Energy Company that PECO did not negotiate in good faith with
regards to its award of its "Competitive Default Customers" to The New Power
Company. The New Power Company filed its response to Green Mountain's October
23 protest of the contract award to New Power on Monday October 30.
New Power's filing described the PECO bidding process and how New Power
submitted its winning bid within the bidding period established by PECO in
its RFP. By contrast, Green Mountain only submitted its current bid 12 days
after the bidding deadline and nine days after it was informed that its
higher priced bid had not been selected and PECO and The New Power Company
had begun negotiating the CDS Agreement.
In its protest to Green Mountain's October 23 filing, PECO confirmed that
Green Mountain submitted its untimely "revised" bid nine days after PECO had
selected the New Power bid. PECO explained that Green Mountain only underbid
New Power after it learned it had lost the award.
H. Eugene Lockhart, president and chief executive officer of The New Power
Company said, "We were awarded this contract fairly, following all proper and
specified procedures. We were selected because we submitted the best price
and because we agreed to satisfy the renewable power source requirement
required in PECO's RFP. Green Mountain's position is completely misleading.
Green Mountain is trying to change the rules of the game after the game is
already over."
The New Power Company is fully confident that the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission will resolve this matter in its favor.
The New Power Company was formed in May 2000 to provide electricity and
natural gas directly to households and small businesses in the deregulated
energy marketplace. The company draws on the expertise, experience and market
strength of such industry leaders as IBM, AOL and Enron to bring savings and
efficiencies to energy consumers.

GREENWICH, Conn. -(Dow Jones)- New Power Co. (NPW) called "completely false"
a claim by Green Mountain Energy Co. that Peco Energy Co. unfairly excluded
Green Mountain and an unnamed third bidder from the second round of bidding
for a 300,000 of Peco's residential retail electric customers.
In a press release Monday, New Power said it filed the response to Green
Mountain's Oct. 23 protest of the contract awarded to New Power on Oct. 30.
New Power said Green Mountain submitted its bid 12 days after the deadline
and nine days after it was informed that its previous bid hadn't been
selected.
New Power said it is "confident" the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission
will resolve the matter in its favor.
Last Wednesday, the commission agreed to review the dispute over the contract
award.
New Power is an online retailing venture formed in May by Enron Corp. (ENE),
America Online Inc. (AOL) and International Business Machines Corp. (IBM).

Speculation Swirls On Gore, Bush Energy Cabinet Posts

10/30/2000
Dow Jones International News
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

WASHINGTON (AP)--While the rest of the country waits to see who will be the
next U.S. president, speculation in Washington has already turned to likely
Cabinet members responsible for energy and environmental issues.
For the most part, Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush are keeping
their own counsel on likely Cabinet members in prospective Democratic and
Republican administrations. But from sources in and out of government some
possible choices have emerged.
For Gore, one name mentioned for secretary of energy is Sen. Richard Bryan,
D-Nev., with longer odds seen for two others: Tom Grumbly, who formerly
headed a nuclear weapons cleanup effort at the Energy Department, and Deputy
Energy Secretary T.J. Glauthier.
For Bush, possible picks include Tom Kuhn, a buddy from Yale and head of the
Edison Electric Institute, and Kenneth Lay, 1996 Republican convention
chairman and chairman of the giant gas and energy concern Enron Corp. (ENE)
Another possible Republican pick for Energy would be Montana Gov. Marc
Racicot, a leading spokesman on land issues in the West.
Racicot may be a more likely pick for top job at the Interior Department. But
if Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., loses his race for re-election, Bush might tap
him for Interior.
On the Gore side, speculation about Interior is all over the lot. There's
Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber; former Colorado Gov. Roy Roemer, who now runs the
Los Angeles school system; Sen. Bryan; George Frampton, acting head of the
White House Council on Environmental Quality and former Wilderness Society
director, and former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth.
Bush's director for the Environmental Protection Agency might be David
Struhs, a moderate in the minds of environmentalists who directs the Florida
Department of Environmental Protection. Two more-conservative prospects are
Chris DeMuth, a regulatory expert at the American Enterprise Institute, and
Russell Harding, head of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality.
For Gore, a front-runner appears to be Kathleen McGinty, former head of the
Council on Environmental Quality under Clinton. Another possibility is
Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, stepping aside to elevate Lt. Gov. Kathleen
Kennedy Townsend.

Guessing the new Cabinet while Gore, Bush campaign
By DEB RIECHMANN
Associated Press Writer

Copyright 2000. The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

WASHINGTON (AP) - While the rest of the country waits to see who will be the
next president, in this city - where politics is both vocation and avocation
- a lot of the speculation is about who will be in the next Cabinet.
The top economic post? For treasury secretary, George W. Bush could pick
former Federal Reserve member Lawrence Lindsey, who has been traveling on
some of Bush's campaign trips. Or someone from Wall Street. Al Gore might
well keep the incumbent secretary, Lawrence Summers, in hopes of keeping the
economy thriving.
If Bush wins, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson or the school superintendent from
Houston back home in Texas could wind up in his Cabinet - along with a
handful of people who served in his father's administration.
If Gore wins, newcomers could include the mayor of Detroit or the governor of
Maryland, or North Carolina, or Delaware - but with many positions going to
familiar faces from the Clinton administration.
And whichever man wins, the job running the Department of Agriculture could
go to the same person - veteran Texas Rep. Charles Stenholm, who is in danger
of losing his seat to redistricting.
Richard Holbrooke, with a foreign policy resume stretching back to Vietnam
and Lyndon Johnson, is the frequently heard choice for secretary of state in
a Gore administration. And everyone - even Bush, it seems - expects Colin
Powell to get that job in a Bush administration.
On the campaign trail, Bush introduces the former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff as "a man who used to be in government, and if all goes well,
well. ..."
Holbrooke, who is ambassador to the United Nations, isn't a sure thing for a
Gore Cabinet. Speculation also includes former Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell and former Indiana Rep. Lee Hamilton, who was chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
For the most part, the presidential candidates are keeping their own counsel
on their likely Cabinet members. They may be the only people who are. From
sources in and out of government, these are some possible choices:
FOREIGN POLICY:
In addition to Holbrooke, Mitchell or Hamilton at State, conventional wisdom
has Gore's foreign policy adviser, Leon Fuerth, as a shoo-in for national
security adviser.
Joining Powell at the top of foreign policy under Bush would be Stanford
University scholar Condoleezza Rice as national security adviser. She served
in President Bush's White House.
DEFENSE:
Frequently mentioned for the Pentagon in a Bush administration: Paul
Wolfowitz, Richard Perle and Richard Armitage. Of the three, Armitage has
been the most active in the Bush campaign, traveling with the candidate on
trips when the candidate touches on defense policy.
Wolfowitz, dean of international studies at Johns Hopkins University, was
undersecretary of defense for policy when Dick Cheney, Bush's running mate,
was defense secretary. Perle, defense braintruster at the American Enterprise
Institute, was assistant defense secretary during the Reagan administration.
Armitage was ambassador to the newly independent Soviet states and he served
at State and Defense under President Bush.
A possible Gore Pentagon chief, former Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., was chairman of
the Senate Armed Services Committee. Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig,
who served in Jimmy Carter's Pentagon, is another possibility.
TREASURY:
Should Gore win, Summers could stay on. Other names being floated: William
Daley, secretary of commerce in the Clinton administration and head of Gore's
campaign, former Fannie Mae chairman Jim Johnson and Steve Rattner, a
Democratic contributor who is a partner in a private equity firm, Quadrangle
Group.
Bush's most prominent economic adviser has been Lindsey, who was appointed to
the Federal Reserve Board by Bush's father. Lindsey has been on many recent
Bush campaign trips.
A name heard on Wall Street is Donald Marron, who runs the PaineWebber
brokerage house. John Cogan, a Stanford University economist and policy
adviser to Presidents Reagan and Bush, also is said to be in the running.
Cogan also has accompanied the Texas governor on campaign swings.
JUSTICE:
If Gore wins, some former Justice Department officials think the next
attorney general could be Charles Burson, former Texas attorney general and
the vice president's current chief of staff.
Other contenders are Eric Holder, the current deputy attorney general, and
Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, a former Supreme Court justice in Michigan.
Still other names are Gore's brother-in-law Frank Hunger, formerly an
assistant attorney general; former deputy attorney general Jamie Gorelick,
now vice chairman at Fannie Mae, and Walter Dellinger, former solicitor
general.
Often mentioned for Bush is Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, who was No. 3 at
Justice during Bush's father's administration; Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who
helped Bush prepare for his debates, and Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., should he
lose his re-election bid.
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES:
Current Secretary Donna Shalala appears headed for a university post but is
the choice of some women's advocates for White House chief of staff under
Gore.
If Gore wins, Surgeon General David Satcher could be given HHS. He's a former
director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.
Other names: Leon Panetta, former White House chief of staff and President
Clinton's former budget director; Alice Rivlin, also a former Clinton budget
director and Federal Reserve Board member; David Kessler, former
administrator of the Food and Drug Administration, and Nancy-Ann Min DeParle,
former administrator of the Health Care Financing Administration, which
oversees Medicare and Medicaid.
One other name is former Rep. Tom Downey, D-N.Y., a Gore campaign aide.
If Bush wins, American Red Cross president Bernadine Healy is a possible
choice. President Bush appointed her to head the National Institutes of
Health.
Two others: Gail Wilensky, who helped craft Bush's Medicare prescription drug
plan and directed health care financing in his father's administration, and
Bill Roper, dean of the School of Public Health at the University of North
Carolina and a former director of the CDC.
EDUCATION:
A Bush possibility is Rod Paige, superintendent of the Houston Independent
School District who has appeared with Bush to talk about education in Texas.
Another is Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, chairman of the National Education
Goals Panel. (His experience with welfare reform could make him a pick for
secretary of health and human services as well.)
Other Bush possibilities: Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge, Colorado Gov. Bill
Owens and Lisa Graham Keegan, Arizona's superintendent of public instruction,
a staunch supporter of charter schools and vouchers. Also, a possible
Democrat in Bush's cabinet: former Dallas Democratic Party chairman Sandy
Kress, who has been an informal adviser.
Figuring in the Gore speculation are North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt, who is
seen as a conciliator respected in both parties, Delaware Gov. Tom Carper and
White House domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed.
AGRICULTURE:
Rep. Stenholm, a conservative Democrat who could lose his seat when Texas is
redistricted, is being mentioned in both political camps.
Other Bush possibilities include Ann Veneman, former agricultural
commissioner in California and a senior Agriculture Department official in
the Bush administration; Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., and Charles Kruse, a
Missouri farmer and former state agriculture commissioner.
Other names on the Gore side: Rep. Cal Dooley, D-Calif.; Rep. Gary Condit,
D-Calif., and two Agriculture Department undersecretaries, August Schumacher
Jr. and Jill Long Thompson.
COMMERCE:
Insiders were at a loss to name prospective GOP candidates, saying more
visible Cabinet posts would have to be decided first.
If Gore is elected, Norman Mineta, the first Asian-American member of the
Cabinet, might be asked to stay on. Or Labor Secretary Alexis Herman might
move over. The names of top fund-raisers Peter Knight and Terry McAuliffe
also are being mentioned.
EPA:
Bush's EPA director might be David Struhs, a moderate in the minds of
environmentalists who directs the Florida Department of Environmental
Protection. Two other, more conservative, prospects: Chris DeMuth, a
regulatory expert at the American Enterprise Institute, and Russell Harding,
head of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality.
For Gore, a front-runner appears to be Kathleen McGinty, former head of the
Council on Environmental Quality in the Clinton White House. Another
possibility is Maryland Gov. Parris Glendening, stepping aside to elevate Lt.
Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend.
INTERIOR:
On the Gore side, speculation is all over the lot. There's Oregon Gov. John
Kitzhaber; former Colorado Gov. Roy Roemer, who now runs the Los Angeles
school system; Sen. Richard Bryan of Nevada; George Frampton, acting head of
the White House Council on Environmental Quality and former director of the
Wilderness Society, and former Colorado Sen. Tim Wirth.
For Bush, bets are on Montana Gov. Marc Racicot, who has been a leading
spokesman on land issues in the West. If Sen. Slade Gorton loses his race for
re-election in Washington, however, Bush might tap him.
ENERGY:
If Gorton gets Interior, Racicot might end up at Energy. Other possible Bush
picks include Tom Kuhn, a buddy from Yale and head of the Edison Electric
Institute, and 1996 GOP convention chairman Kenneth Lay, chairman of the
giant gas and energy company, Enron.
For Gore, one name mentioned is Bryan, the Democratic senator from Nevada.
There are longer odds for two others, Tom Grumbly, who formerly headed a
nuclear weapons cleanup effort at Energy, and Deputy Energy Secretary T.J.
Glauthier.

XL Capital Creates Weather-Risk Reinsurer

10/30/2000
Best's Insurance News
Copyright 2000 (c) A.M. Best Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

HAMILTON, Bermuda (BestWire) - XL Capital Ltd. formed a new reinsurance unit
to provide weather-risk-management insurance, reinsurance and financial
products.
The new unit, Element Re, will offer noncatastrophic weather risk-mitigation
products designed to protect against the negative impact that normal weather
fluctuations can have on the financial performance of companies in a variety
of industries, XL Capital said in a statement.
Element Re will be led by Chief Executive Jeffrey Bortniker and Lynda
Clemmons, president and chief operating officer. "Until now, businesses have
had a limited choice in terms of how they managed their weather-related
risk," Bortniker said. "To date, derivatives have been the primary mechanism.
We have identified a growing demand for weather protection in insurance
form--something that is more appealing to corporations around the world."
Clemmons added that the primary market for weather-related-risk-management
products is expanding beyond the traditional customers, such as energy and
utility companies, to include agriculture, construction, retail,
transportation and entertainment.
Element Re is one example of the movement by traditional property/casualty
reinsurers into new markets, in response to declining demand for traditional
reinsurance and new competitors (BestWire, Oct. 23, 2000).
A recent report from insurance consultant Conning & Co., "Property-Casualty
Reinsurance: Developing the Next Frontier," said demand for traditional
property/casualty reinsurance will continue to decline for the next five
years as primary insurers consolidate, grow bigger and improve their ability
to manage their own exposures.
The Conning study found that traditional reinsurers have been hurt by lack of
demand, which sparked price competition to retain market share. As a result,
many reinsurers are exploring alternative markets to expand their businesses.
Element Re's risk management team previously formed the core of the weather
derivatives group at Enron North America, an energy company.
Element Re Advisors Inc., Element Re Capital Products Inc. and Element
Reinsurance Ltd. are subsidiaries of XL Capital Ltd., a provider of insurance
and reinsurance coverage and financial products to industrial, commercial and
professional services firms, insurance companies and other enterprises
worldwide.
The financial strength of XL Capital Ltd. is rated A+ (Superior) by A.M. Best
Co.

Biz - Managing
Thinking ASP?
Don't Forget Security!
Before you sign a contract with an ASP, don't forget to scrutinize its
commitment to keeping your organization's data secure. By Deborah Radcliff
Deborah Radcliff

10/30/2000
Computerworld
58
(Copyright 2000 by Computerworld, Inc. All rights reserved.)

If the rapid convergence of business and the Internet isn't enough of a
security threat, there's now a new bugaboo keeping information technology
managers up at night: application service providers (ASP).
"You've now got a third party responsible for the integrity, confidentiality
and availability of your data," says Pete van de Gohm, director of
information asset protection at Enron Energy Services Inc. in Houston.
Once an organization has handed its applications over to a third party, its
biggest concerns include who's handling and accessing that data and what
guards the connections from the outside, says Amit Yoran, CEO of RipTech
Inc., a security services firm in Alexandria, Va. "ASP users are worried
about the connectivity from the customer to the ASP and how that's protected
from the Internet," he says.
While ASPs say they won't offer any guarantees, many put standard security
offerings in their contracts, such as firewalling and traffic monitoring. But
those who want to earn the business of the Fortune 1,000 companies are also
agreeing to contracts with specified custom security requests for additional
fees, such as scanning the content of incoming mail, setting up and
maintaining virtual private networks or managing firewall and intrusion
detection services.
"Some ASPs are looking at the big picture," says Mitchell Hryckowian, senior
director of security and infrastructure at Interliant Inc., an ASP in
Purchase, N.Y. Interliant, for example, appends its contracts with a security
clause to provide basic traffic monitoring services. In addition, high-end
customers can demand -- and receive -- customized security services be added
to their contracts.
The Threat
Tony Parziale, chief technology officer at online fashion retailer Folded
Edge Inc. in Duluth, Ga., negotiated for customer-centric security clauses
with his ASP, now-defunct Pandesic LLC in Sunnyvale, Calif. [Page One, Aug.
7]
"Security clauses in the initial Pandesic contract were very vague," Parziale
says. So he worked out service-level agreements for customer credit-card
security on transactions and data security for Folded Edge's SAP modules in
addition to setting minimum access and connectivity requirements.
Because his ASP partnered with several back-end service providers, getting
these assurances was complex. For example, Intel Online Services in Santa
Clara, Calif., set up Folded Edge's frame-relay connection and served as
Pandesic's back-end host. It was up to Parziale to track down Intel's
security controls before he could request contract specifications.
Folded Edge didn't encounter any security problems during its two and a half
months with Pandesic, something Parziale attributes to beefed-up security
clauses in the contract between Pandesic and Folded Edge. But that contract
didn't protect the company when Pandesic went out of business, leaving Folded
Edge without an ASP since September.
As Folded Edge searches for another round of funding to get back online,
Parziale is looking for an ASP that handles its own hosting, security and
Internet connectivity so he doesn't have such a tough time tracking down
security policies from multiple vendors.
Additional Measures
Having sat through hundreds of contract negotiations himself, Hryckowian
advises potential ASP customers to read the entire contract carefully. In
addition, he suggests that you:
1. Prequalify the security backgrounds of those who deploy security at your
ASP.
2. Inquire about service-level agreements that suit your business needs.
3. Make sure the contract also includes maintenance windows for regular code
upgrades and patches.
4. Balance acceptable risk against security requests.
5. Know the security products and tools the ASP will deploy.
6. Define what action the ASP will take in case of a breach.
Even with the most comprehensive coverage, ASPs make no guarantees.

Brian Redmond is trying to generate a new business that couples our systems
and infrastructure and puts those services into an ASP.  He is hoping to use
the sale of HPL as the start of this.  Leslie and I worked on an org chart
(positions/functions only) for him one evening this week (copy attached).
Now he would like for us to draft an agreement, with associated costs, to
provide to these potential buyers.  The IT services would also be provided,
and the draft of that agreement is also attached.

I have a starting point for us, using the Bridgeline Services agreement (copy
attached).  We learned alot on the Bridgeline model and it is important for
us to learn from those issues and avoid them for this deal.   Additionally, I
have asked Shari Mao to put together costs of salaries and other associated
costs for the positions listed on the org chart.  We should view the costs
from the perspective that the infrastructure is a stand-alone entity.  All
costs that would be incurred as a stand-alone should be recovered in the
bid.  The meeting on Monday will be a working meeting to ensure we have
addressed all concerns and issues, and ensure the bid is appropriate.  Brian
has not been specific on the due date for this, just "sometime next week."  I
talked with Patrick Wade, and he felt Wednesday (9/20) should be the target.

Thanks in advance for attending.

This is a bit long, but hilarious!!!!!


COPIED FROM A NEWSGROUP POSTING - (the author is responding to a
woman who accidentally walked into the men's restroom):

Please don't feel bad. It wasn't you entering the men's washroom
that caused that guy to pee on the guy next to him. Hell, we do that all the
time. It's rare us guys ever hit what were aiming for.

Sometimes I go into the washroom, start to pee, and then just start
spinning around; just so I'll make sure I hit something.

You see, something you ladies should understand by now is that men's
penises have a mind of their own. A guy can go into a bathroom stall because
all the urinals are being used, take perfect aim at the toilet, and his
penis will still manage to piss all over the roll of toilet paper, down his
left pant leg, and onto his shoe. I'm telling 'ya those little buggers can't
be trusted.

After being married 28 years my wife has me trained. I'm no longer
allowed to pee like a man - standing up. I am required to sit down and pee.
She has convinced me that this is a small price to pay. Otherwise if she had
gone to the toilet one more time at night and either sat on a pee soaked
toilet seat, or fell right into the toilet because I forgot to put the seat
down, she was going to kill me in my sleep.

Now another thing us guys don't usually like to talk about, but
because you and I have become such good friends and you think I'm a classy
guy, I might as well be candid with you because it's a real problem, and you
ladies need to be understanding. It's the dreaded "morning wood".

Most mornings us guys wake up with two things. A tremendous desire
to pee, and a penis so hard you could cut diamonds with it. Well, no matter
how hard you try, you can't get that thing to bend, and if it won't bend you
can't aim, well hell, if you can't aim you have no choice but to piss all
over the wallpaper and that damn fuzzy toilet seat cover you women insist on
putting on the toilet.

And by the way, when you use those damn fuzzy toilet seat covers,
the friggin' toilet seat won't stay up by itself. So that means we have to
use one hand to hold up the toilet seat and the other hand to try to control
our less than perfect aim.

Now sometimes, when you're newly married, (and I know the guys in
here will back me up on this) you think you can get the toilet seat with
that damn fuzzy thing to stay up. You jam it back and compress that fuzzy
thing until the seat stays there. OK, so you start to pee, but then that
compressed fuzzy starts to decompress and without warning that damn toilet
seat comes flying down and tries to whack off your weenie. So us guys will
not lift a toilet seat with a fuzzy, it's just not safe.

I tried to delicately explain this morning situation to my wife. I
told her... look, it won't bend. She said, "so sit down like I told you to
do all the rest of the time." OK. I tried sitting down on the toilet with
"morning wood".

Well it's is very hard to get it bent under the toilet seat, and
before I could manage it, I had pissed all over the bath towels hanging on
the wall across the room.

Now, even if you are sitting down and you can get it forced down
under the toilet seat, when you start to pee the pee shoots out from the
crack between the bottom of the toilet seat and the top of the bowl. You
piss all over the back of your knees and it runs down the back of our legs
on to that damn matching fuzzy horseshoe rug you keep putting on the floor
in front of the toilet.

I have found the only effective maneuver to deal with this morning
urinary dilemma is to assume the flying Superman position laying over the
toilet seat. This takes a great deal of practice, perfect balance, and split
time precision but it's the only sure way to get all the pee in the bowl
during the first morning pee.

So you ladies have to understand that us men are not totally to
blame. We are sensitive to your concerns about hygiene and bathroom
cleanliness, but there are times when things just get beyond our control.

It's not our fault, it's just Mother Nature.

Now, if it was Father Nature, there wouldn't have been a problem!!!

The Cal ISO, Williams, AES Corporation, Southern, and Reliant moved that the
CPUC modify its protective order.  People are protesting the fact that they
have to file their answers before resolution of multiple issues over the
protective order.  Williams is threatening to file a motion to quash.  It
says "to the extent the CPUC is conducting a valid investigation within
jurisdictional bounds, Williams will cooperate."  Richard you may want to

Steve, Jeff, and others: .
Here are some of my thoughts:
Power price strip.  The power prices pulled together from the Davis-Lay
meeting are based on a weighted average of off- and on-peak prices.  We can
easily show on- and off-peak prices  separately.  We're making a FERC filing
on Tues showing l-t prices so we can pull peak/off peak from that data.
Note, however, that "baseload" power is equivalent to 24x7x365 power, which
is what we provided him.
In terms of my other reactions:
Not enough DSM.  The best analysis of the West trading desk is that we are in
a temporary, WSCC-wide energy shortage, not a capacity shortage.  Anything
that reduces kWh demand will leave more water behind dams and natural gas
storage.  This will translate into lower market prices.  Until more natural
gas supply, generating capacity, and rainfall comes along, we will see high
prices.  If Davis is unwilling to raise rates, he should be willing to take
some extraordinary measures to cut demand.  At a minimum, there should be
expanded pay-for-curtailment curtailment programs.
Voluntary Opt Out of Rate Freeze  I have not thought through all the EES
implications but one thing that could be "sold" to customers is to give them
the option of buying an interval meter and pay the current market price of
power.  That would empower them to modify demand and not incur ongoing,
increasing stranded cost liability.
Muni's need to get involved.  I assume that Enron won't take a position on
requiring muni's to sell generation in California but Enron should support
having muni's be cajoled to participate in demand reduction programs for the
reasons noted above.  As recently as 12/23 Freeman said there was no need to
conserve at LADWP.  Pretty irresponsible.
Tie Govt Backings with Move to Cost-Based Prices.  Securitization and state
credit guarantees are great ways to lower the cost of money to the utilties
in this crisis.  However, both are irresponsible actions unless there is  a
plan to move retail rates to a level that covers the full cost of power.

Just FYI.  I got a call from Liz Orr [Wildhorse] who said per her acctg group
we have been flowing around 2,700 mcf/d for October and November.   Per the
production spreadsheet from Jim/Dan, the production has been around 3,000
mcf/d +/- 50 mcf/d for both months.  This is the same as 3,200 mmbtu/d [Btu
factor is 1.06 to 1.07].  Our nom on Wildhorse has been 3200 mmbtu/d.

I just found out that our nom on Wildhorse s/b in mcfs, not in mmbtus.  So,
that will confuse matters.  Per Wildhorse we have an imbalance of 500 per day
[3,200 mcf/d nom vs actuals of 2,700 mcf/d] - 16,000 for Oct.  Thus, per
Wildhorse, we need to reduce the nom to around 2,200 mcf/d in order to come
back in line.   The concern with reducing the nom should not affect the VPP
volumes, but it will affect the excess volume [pricing] because for the month
of November, Paul Lucci has sold the 3,200 mmbtu/d as baseload.  Stacy Brewer
[ENA scheduler] will discuss with Paul.  Thus, if we reduce our nom, it will
affect his baseload market and he will have to go out and buy gas in order to
keep his market whole, and prices have gone up mid month.  [Mark Whitt - I
know this is mixing mcfs and mmbtus and in reality it's not as simply stated
as above].

In discussions with Jim, Dan Reineke [sp?] will get Wildhorse's actuals from
their acctg group, then he will reconcile his numbers with theirs, and come
up with the final actual numbers.  Apparently that will take him about a
day.  So, we need to wait til actuals get reconciled in order to figure out
what our imbalance is.  We do need to reduce our nom from 3,200 mcf/d to
3,000 mcf/d, but Liz said to hold off on that for now.

Per disc with Jim Osborne and Liz Orr, 11/15 pm.

Yesterday, Fred Ni from the FERC called with some questions regarding the TW
options filing.  Most all of his questions centered around the determination
of the highest value.
Bottom of page 7, last paragragh, we say Shipper call options will be
awarded upon the highest rate payable for the  option component.
Then in the bullets that follow we say, based on the criteria known in
advance-  I told him that we would post the   elements and it would determine
the highest value.
Then in the next paragraph we say again sold in a bidding process to only
those parties that place the highest value  on the option.
Then on the actual tariff sheet, 98 we refer to in  33 c) method of awarding
options, ?? being is the highest value
Then on tariff sheet 157, in the Option Fee section he felt we should refer
to the elements that make up the highest   value; volume , rate and term
As you can tell, this all centers around the elements of determining the
highest bid,  I advised him that it included rate, volume and term that the
option call was for.   We need to clarify these in writing as soon as
possible.  I told him we would do so in our answer to interventions.  He said
the sooner the better.  We also need to add expriation date on tariff sheet
98 c as to items included in the posting, since it could be different than
the exercise date.
I'd say all in all this is good that this is his only concern and that he
called before any protests etc.  He said he like the filing-  but was just
confused on what we meant by awarding to the highest value.
Susan, I assume you will be drafting the answer, although at this point I
haven't seen any protests, let's try to have the answer filed Friday or
Monday at the latest.    Please call if questions-  MK

Summary:

Late night efforts by the California assembly to craft a legislative solution
are falling short of market and creditor expectations.  Bankruptcy appears
increasingly likely, but the dynamics of a Ch.11 proceeding remain unclear.
SoCal Edison is likely to be the first in Ch.11 following its suspended
payments to creditors yesterday and is now in a 30 day cure period.  Attempts
to bring in the assets of the parent companies are unlikely to succeed.
Bankruptcy would provide Davis with some political cover to implement the
tough decisions that he has so far avoided on the questions of rate hikes and
other costs to taxpayers connected to the proposed operations of the
California Power Authority.

1. Legislation Passes Assembly, But Generators and Consumers Remain Unhappy

The first legislation (AB 1X)  passed the California general assembly last
night, but both generators and consumers are unhappy with the terms.
Generators object to the 5.5 cent per KW/H price in the proposed long-term
contract, while consumer groups such as the Foundation for Taxpayer and
Consumer Rights object to the state acting as a purchaser of power.  The
legislation is expected to pass the Senate today and to be signed by Governor
Davis as early as tonight.

Press and source reporting this morning confirms that the principal financial
creditors and utility analysts are also unimpressed with the bill, which is
viewed as insubstantial and falling short of creating a solution to the
financial pressures on the utilities.

2. Financial Institutions Exposure to California Utilities

Bank of America: $215 million
J.P. Morgan: $202 million

There is a total of $12 billion in outstanding loans, but much of this
(arranged by Societe General) is to the parents National Energy Group and
Edison International.  The $417 million mentioned above is the most immediate
concern.  The Southern California Edison loans are subject to immediate
repayment in the aftermath of yesterday's rating downgrade to junk status.

The Fed will not be involved, except in a routine way as a bank regulator
making sure that the appropriate risk reserves are made against the
utilities' loans and securities. There is no moral hazard here, because the
Fed is not going to guarantee any of the utilities' credits, which, by the
way, they do not have the authority to do.

3. PG&E/National Energy Group- Shielding Assets

Despite considerable anger at  PG&E for reorganizing to shield its profitable
assets from its debt-plagued utility business, it would seem that Davis has
little authority to intervene. The question of "fraudulent conveyance", which
is a term in bankruptcy law for transferring assets to favored parties not
long before a filing (which transfer can then be reversed by the court) would
not seem to apply here, since PG&E went through a regulatory process before
FERC to seek approval for the reorganization on Friday.  While courts are
reluctant to overturn regulatory agencies, impaired creditors in a bankruptcy
proceeding could attempt an appeal.

4. Involuntary Bankruptcy- Which Creditor Moves First?

As for who is likely to move first, it is typically the smaller creditors or
those who won't receive a good price on post-petition business. In this
situation our source does not know who that would be, but believes it is more
likely that the utilities will file a voluntary petition before one of their
major creditors files an involuntary petition.

If Dynergy files a petition with a federal bankruptcy court today, the debtor
utilities can delay the process for weeks if they choose to, particularly
since there is no allegation of fraud or criminal misappropriation of
assets.  In bankruptcy proceedings (which is what is going on here), this
sort of talk by a creditor such as Dynegy is just the usual "polite
conversational opener," akin to comments about the weather or inquiries about
one's family's health.

5. Edison Teetering on the Brink- Moves Into 30 Day Cure Period

Yesterday, Southern California Edison temporarily suspended a $230 million
bond principal and interest payments as well as $151 million to suppliers of
renewable power and $215 million due to the California PX.  Both utilities
are under severe short-term debt pressure, but Edison is in the worst
position.

Edison
Due Thursday: Dynegy note; Dynegy has threaten to take take Edison into
bankruptcy court if they default

PG&E
Current available: $500M in cash and reserves
Due Feb:
1st - $580M to ISO
15th - $431M to California Power Exchange


Contrary to press reports and leaks from the Governor's office yesterday
about political brinksmanship, Edison is clearly not playing negotiating
games and is really short of cash. In this situation, it is unlikely that its
executives will be making fraudulent statements. The bonds on which they
failed to pay would have a 30-day cure period. After that the trustees will
move on Edison, if Edison has not already filed.  They have three ways of
financing power purchases going forward: 1) the state continues to buy power
and sell Edison (and PG&E) power on a short-term basis under existing
authority; or 2) pending the passage of today's legislation, the state
legislature authorizes the purchase of power through long-term contracts
under the proposed borrowing authority; or 3) Edison files for reorganization
under Chapter 11 and obtains almost immediately superpriority post-petition
lines of credit secured against its unmortgaged assets, which it uses to pay
for power until the PUC and the rest of the state government recognize that
rates have to increase.

6. New Hampshire Experience A Guide for Davis?

Following the bankruptcy of the Public Service Company of New Hampshire, the
bankruptcy judge was authorized by a higher court to mandate rate hikes.  The
prospect of imposed rate hikes from the bankruptcy court caused the state
government to subsequently determine that rate hikes to consumers were
unavoidable, passing a seven year rate hike of 7.5 percent.

For Davis, a similar scenario would provide him with some political cover, if
he were forced by the bankruptcy court to pass through rate hikes as part of
a settlement.

AEP to Divide Its Assets Between Two New Companies (Update1)
Bloomberg, 10/31/00


JAPAN: UPDATE 1-Enron says priority in Japan is electricity market.

10/31/2000
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2000.

TOKYO, Oct 31 (Reuters) - Enron Corp Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth Lay
said on Tuesday the Houston-based company's near-term priority in Japan was
the electricity supply market, which is undergoing deregulation.
"One of our highest priorities...in the next two or three years is
electricity," Lay told a news conference.
Last year, Enron established its first Japanese venture, E Power, to try to
break into Japan's electricity market that since March has allowed
non-utility firms to supply power to large-lot industrial and commercial
users.
Japanese media have reported that Enron, North America's leading buyer and
seller of electricity and natural gas, plans to build a coal-fired power
plant in Fukuoka prefecture on the southern main island of Kyushu.
Asked whether Enron planned to buy or build a power plant in Japan, Lay said
the company believed there was surplus capacity in Japan on which it hoped to
draw.
"Our belief is, if anything, today there probably is surplus capacity both of
generation and transmission capacity," Lay said.
"It's not a matter that we are reluctant to buy or build assets," he said.
"If the market has surplus capacity, there's not much reason to do that, at
least initially."
Enron also unveiled on Tuesday a package offering eligible electricity users
three-to five-year electricity contracts that it says will reduce their
electricity bills by up to 10 percent for the first year, with the
possibility of further reductions for the remaining years of the contract.
Several other foreign energy firms have also shown an interest in entering
the Japanese market.
These include U.S. oil major Texaco Inc , Vivendi SA and the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group .
None has started actually supplying electricity to large-lot consumers in
Japan, however. Enron set up a second subsidiary in May, Enron Japan Corp,
with the aim of seeking business opportunities other than electricity supply
in Japan, mainly through EnronOnline.
The Web-based EnronOnline trading system had, as of October 11, executed more
than 350,000 transactions with a gross value of $183 billion on the system
since it was launched in late 1999.
Enron uses the online system to make markets in commodities such as pulp and
paper, petrochemicals, metals and broadband capacity, in addition to gas and
power.

Enron's Japan Unit To Offer "Elec Discount Pdt" Nov

10/31/2000
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2000, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Enron Corp. (ENE), the Houston-based energy and
communications giant, said Tuesday its wholly-owned subsidiary Enron Japan
Corp. will offer effective Nov. 1 an "electricity discount product" targeting
Japan's high-volume large-lot power users, numbering 8,000.
Joseph Hirl, Enron Japan's president and chief executive officer, told
reporters that his company is "already working with a number of entities" to
discuss power supply contracts.
Enron's package, which will typically run three to five years, will allow
customers to "immediately" cut up to 10% in their current electricity costs
for the first year of the contracts, with the possibility of further
reduction for the following years.
In the first full year of the contract, Enron will pay a financial rebate of
up to 10% to a customer on a kilowatt-hour basis, under the customers'
existing power supply contracts with other power suppliers.
Enron will pay a rebate in the first year but will not actually supply
electricity.
From the second year onward, Enron will supply actual electricity to the
customer at agreed fixed prices.
Under the government's partial deregulation implemented March 21, high-volume
large-lot retail electricity consumers - which represent roughly 27% of
Japan's total power demand - can now freely choose their power suppliers.
Enron declined to elaborate on how it plans to secure electricity necessary
for fulfilling the proposed contracts.
Enron Corp.'s chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay, who was speaking at the same
press conference, said the company's highest priority in the Japanese market
for the next two to three years will be electricity trading and marketing.
Next comes trading in metals, weather derivatives and pulp and paper, Lay
said.

In addition to those main focus areas, Enron Japan's Hirl said there is
"tremendous potential" in areas such as liquefied natural gas, coal and
foreign exchange trading.
"We're looking to provide much services we can at the best price, and in many
cases at lower prices, in most of the services we provide," Hirl said.
Enron also plans to introduce broadband services in Japan.
"For the next two to three years, establishing and extending our broadband
network in Japan is a key part of our growth," said Kenneth Rice, chairman
and CEO of Enron Broadband Services.
Japan is a huge Internet market and it's also a logical foothold for Enron to
extend its network into the rest of Asia, he said.
By offering "EnronOnline" - the world's largest business-to-business
electronic commerce platform, "Enron can help the Japanese economy become
more efficient by significantly reducing the costs of many products and
services," Lay said.

HOUSTON CHRONICLE
Arena flier rouses ire of backers
Letter attacks plan, mayor and Democrats
By ERIC BERGER
Copyright 2000 Houston Chronicle
Arena proponents are decrying a letter circulating among area Republicans
that ties the proposal to Houston Mayor Lee Brown and contains at least six
factual errors.
Brown, a central figure in the 1999 arena proposition that voters rejected,
has had a considerably less visible role in this year's effort. Many
Republicans viewed a vote against the arena last year as a vote against
Brown, a Democrat, and an opportunity to embarrass him.
"There are three areas where we believe Mayor Lee Brown's multimillion-dollar
corporate welfare campaign must be addressed," states the letter, which was
mailed to more than 500 Republicans and was sponsored by Republican precinct
chairwoman Mary Jane Smith.
What it fails to mention is that conservative U.S. Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Houston, has endorsed the plan and that the pro-arena campaign chairmen are
notable Republican fund-raisers Ken Lay and Don Jordan.
"I suppose she believes that we've programmed Lay and Jordan to vote
Democrat," said pro-arena campaign manager Dave Walden. "And that I spent a
day hypnotizing Bill Archer."
Beyond Brown, the letter also seeks to tie the pro-arena campaign to Vice
President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential candidate.
"They have teamed up with Democrat activists and Mayor Lee P. Brown to
connect arena and Gore voters," according to the letter. "Turn out a
pro-arena vote and you turn out a Gore vote."
Such questionable associations -- Lay, for example, is one of Republican
presidential candidate Gov. George W. Bush's closest business advisers --
offer a vivid look at how desperate arena opponents are, Walden contends.
This criticism failed to stymie Smith, who plans to send out another printing
of the letter this week. "All of my Republican buddies are opposed to this,"
she said. "I think it's kind of funny the arena people are taking the
attitude of `How dare anyone question us?' "
The letter, which clearly targets Brown, further suggests that "what Houston
lacks is world-class leaders" who would have negotiated a tougher deal with
Houston Rockets owner Leslie Alexander.
"Mayor Lee Brown won't fund the immunization of Houston's poor Hispanic
children, but he is able to build a parking garage benefiting a handful of
multimillionaires," the letter says.
Walden called that statement racist.
It is also inaccurate, as the city is not building the parking garage. A
group of private business leaders, headed by Lay, will lend the Harris
County-Houston Sports Authority $30 million for the garage. The sports
authority, and its hotel and car rental tax revenues, are not affiliated with
the city.
Among other errors in the letter:
"The ballot language does NOT rule out ... the usual cost overruns." This
is irrelevant because the Houston Rockets pay construction cost overruns.
"Taxpayers fund and build the arena garage with Les Alexander reaping ALL
of the parking fees." The private, interest-free loan will help the sports
authority finance the garage. To help repay the loan, the sports authority
will collect parking fees during the daytime and at concerts and other events
that don't involve Alexander's Rockets, Comets and ThunderBears.
Although the city gets use of the arena for 20 dates a year, the letter
says that only five days may be leased for revenue. In fact, all 20 dates may
be used for fund-raisers. This was clarified in changes to the letter of
agreement between the Rockets and the sports authority.
"This year's ballot language gives an incredible $200 million to the
Rockets for naming rights, while the city receives less than 10 percent."
Under terms of the agreement, the Rockets may sell the naming rights to the
arena, but it is unlikely the team would receive $200 million. Such a payment
is not guaranteed by the ballot language. The city receives 5 percent of the
revenue from the sale of the naming rights.
"Today, Houston is building the Hobby Arts Center, again, with no public
funding. If we can use private funding for the arts, why can't our sports
owners fund their own projects?" Actually, the city donated land appraised at
$35 million for the Hobby Center for the Performing Arts, and gave another
$30 million in hotel taxes toward its construction. The city also gives $8
million annually to the Cultural Arts Council of Houston, a $3.5 million
subsidy to the Wortham Center and a $1.5 million subsidy to Jones Hall.





AEP to Divide Its Assets Between Two New Companies (Update1)
10/30/0 18:40 (New York)

AEP to Divide Its Assets Between Two New Companies (Update1)

(Adds company, analyst comments starting in fourth
paragraph.)

San Francisco, Oct. 30 (Bloomberg) -- American Electric Power
Co., a Columbus, Ohio-based owner of utilities in 11 U.S. states
and Europe, said it will split its regulated utilities from its
less-regulated businesses, creating two wholly owned companies.
The company also said it has ruled out merging Seeboard Plc,
a natural gas and power distributor it owns in England, with
Yorkshire Electricity Plc, a U.K. utility partly owned by AEP.
The separation of its businesses is patterned on plans it has
already filed in Ohio and Texas, AEP said. Earlier this year, the
company was required to separate all or most of its power plants
and assets from its transmission lines and related assets in those
states as part of efforts to open the Ohio and Texas markets to
competition.
The separation will take about a year to complete, said E.
Linn Draper Jr., AEP's chairman, president and chief executive
officer. Once it is completed, AEP will have the option of
spinning off one of the two companies.
``We will have options of IPO, spin-off, divestiture,''
Draper told analysts at the Edison Electric Institute conference
in San Francisco.
As deregulation is approved in other states, AEP said, it
plans to move all of its transmission system into the company that
runs its regulated utilities, which will continue to have fixed
rates of return set by regulators, and move its power plants into
the company that runs less-regulated businesses with more
opportunities for growth.
``I think it's the best way for them to organize such a big
company,'' said PaineWebber Inc. analyst Barry Abramson, who has a
``neutral'' rating on AEP. ``It'll focus better attention on the
growth business, not the slower-growing distribution business.''

`Undervalued' Shares

Draper told analysts that part of the reason for the
restructuring is to raise the value of the company's shares by
more clearly showing the performance of its better-performing
generation, wholesale marketing and trading businesses.
``We are very unhappy about the stock price,'' Draper said.
``We think it is significantly undervalued.''
The wholesale power business -- the buying and selling of
power between utilities and other large consumers and generators -
- is already deregulated.
``We have no plans to expand our distribution business either
in the United States or internationally,'' Draper said.
AEP said it will file its restructuring plan with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission sometime this week and complete
the separation by the end of 2001, in line with the deregulation
timetable in Texas and other states it serves.
AEP completed the $10 billion acquisition of Central & South
West Corp. in June, creating a utility with 5 million customers.
Seeboard and the stake in Yorkshire came with the purchase.
In February, then-Central & Southwest President Tom Shockley,
now AEP vice chairman, discussed the possibility of merging
Seeboard and Yorkshire. U.K. utilities have been squeezed recently
by taxes and regulated price cuts.
Combining those businesses provided no major cost savings,
Draper said today.
``We think that keeping them separate gives us options,'' he
said. ``It simply made better sense to keep our options open.''
AEP owns more than 38,000 megawatts of generation. About
25,000 megawatts of the company's generation will be deregulated
by the end of 2001. AEP also is the No. 2 power trader and
marketer after Enron Corp.
Shares of Columbus, Ohio-based AEP rose $1.88 to $41.81.

Jim:  Thanks for your update.   As you recall, Phil attended the April 2000
Congressional staff trip to the Enron building.  Further,  for years we have
negotiated directly with his boss on electricity legislative efforts and we
have gained his support and leadership for Enron's positions.  We continue to
constantly update him and all staffers on our positions.  We will continue to
do so with yearly fact finding trips to Houston, meetings, letters, hearings,
briefings, coalition building, ope-eds, etc.  Fact is, the California issue
climaxed after federal legislation was declared "dead" for this Congress.  As
such, other active legislative vehicles have claimed Congressional
attention.  Thus, Phil was referring to a recent Senate hearing on the
California situation (October 5th) where we supplied questions, information,
etc. that no other member except Senator Gorton attended (i.e. low
interest.)  Having said this, as the cycle ramps up after the elections and
the new Congress convenes in January and February, Congressional interest
will return with "understanding" California being a key focus.  Educating on
the California situation will be amongst our primary objectives although in
the Congressional downtime, we must continue specific efforts with key
targets (i.e. Congressman Barton, Congressman Tauzin, Senator Murkowski,
etc.).  This is why, for instance, I had requested travel approval to attend
the Rippon Society's trip with the Speaker and these members in order to be
able to take advantate of opportunities to educate in informal settings.  We
will continue to find other opportunities and make opportunities to visit
with these Members while they are out of D.C. between now and January.
As for Private Use legislation, Enron developed and led the strategy which
brought EEI to the table with resulting final consensus legislation.  This
consensus came very close to being added to the tax package which may move
Friday but was dropped due to its high price tag.  As for NAERO, there is NOT
consensus.  In fact, we support Senator Gorton's version of the bill but
oppose Congressman Wynn's version.  Since Joe Hartsoe has been the lead with
NAERO, I will defer further comment to him.  As for comprehensive
legislation, the Senate came very close and indeed pass a bill out of
Committee.  The issues that doomed the bill were the two "non-consensus"
issues:   the native load exception and RPS (which indeed a deal was actually
cut.)  In truth,  we also had cut the deal on native load exception but
consensus came too late in the year for EEI and NARUC to formally sign-off.
This is why we have tried to get the EEI process moving now.
Thank you again for your speech and the update.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Today Mona and I attended a meeting of the "California Energy Solutions
Group" (formerly the AB 1890 Implementation Group).  But for the issues
discussed below, there's not much else to report from the meeting other than
folks engaged in a good deal of posturing.

At our urging, the group decided to form a "subcommittee" comprised of a
subset of the group.  The group will work quickly to develop a "strawperson"
proposal to present to the larger group for consideration.  The goal is to
quickly arrive at a "settlement"---ideally by year end, or sooner---that
everyone can agree to and offer up to Davis, legislators, etc.

Our "reward" for coming up with the idea is the requirement that we serve on
the "committee."  In addition to us, the other people on the committee are:

Eve Elsesser will chair the committee---Cogen types
John Fielder---Edison
Mike Florio--TURN
Bill Booth---CLECA
Carolyn McIntyre---Sempra
Smutney--Generators
Aaron Thomas--AES (retail)
Tony Braun--Munis
Ralph Cavanagh--NRDC
John Flory--CALPX

It is clear that one of the key issues is devising the "benchmark" that the
CPUC can use to judge the reasonableness of utility purchases---similar to
the model used for utility procurement on the gas side.  Chris Calger is in
the office working on the power plant deals and I briefly discussed with him
ways of devising a politically palatable, commercially defensible benchmark.
We came up with some ideas that he suggested I pursue further with Bob
Badeer, Chris Foster and Tim Belden, which I'll do on Monday.   The first
meeting of the subcommittee is on Tuesday.

If possible, I'd like to add the "benchmark" and "committee" issues to our
agenda for Tuesday's meeting.

Best,
Jeff

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


THE FRIDAY BURRITO

"If you aren,t confused, then you don,t understand the problem."

That was a close one.  Favre threw the ball down field to his favorite
receiver last Monday night, Antonio Freeman, in what turned out to be
the last play of the game in overtime.  Viking's defenseman Dishman
flicked the ball up in the air, Freeman went to the ground, but the ball
landed on Freeman,s back.  It slid down Freeman,s jersey, and as he
turned to look, the ball gently poured into Freeman,s waiting open
hands.  The ball and Freeman made a fair catch, and a quick trip to the
end zone.  Game over.  Packers won.

That was the closest and best ending to a football game I can recall in
a long time.

Otherwise it was a ho-hum week.

Oh, yah.  The State of California held its one-party election last
Tuesday, and all members of that party won, I think.  There is no
Republican Party anymore in California.  Those politicians have been
exported like our in-state electrons under price-caps to Arizona or
Nevada.  The radical minority is now firmly in place.  This will make
power-related legislation a hoot in the coming legislative session.  A
veto-proof Assembly and Senate with a $7 billion surplus.  Jeez.  What
would you care to bet that we don,t see one nickel of that $7 billion in
tax reductions? You know we,re in trouble when Lady Bird Bowen and Steve
Peace claim that they are each to the far right of their Democratic
colleagues.

Speaking of Mr. Peace, we had a chance to meet for the first time, and
have a real conversation.  It was in Washington, D.C., a good neutral
turf, at the hotel where quite a few other Californians and I were
staying.  We were attending FERC,s technical conference on the Order
issued last week.  It was all an accident, I suppose.  I was sipping a
brewski with CMUA,s Tony Braun in the hotel bar.  I was explaining to
Tony what a terrible thing it was for CMUA to support a return to cost
of service rates, and what are we going to do about the ISO,s GMC
filing?  In walks Peace and his legislative aide, John Rozsa.  So, being
a nice guy, I utilized your hard-earned WPTF dues, and bought them both
a drink.  A bloody Mary for Rozsa and decaf coffee for  the Senator.

Two-and-one-half hours later we were still drinking and talking.  I hate
to admit it, but I had a good time.  "Why do you call John Fielder +The
Great Warrior,?" Peace asked me after I shared with him my nickname for
JF.  I told him the story, skipping all the nicknames handed out in past
Burritos to the two gentlemen in my then present company.  A lot of what
we discussed Peace repeated to the FERC Commissioners the next day.
Below, I review the logic of his case concerning the future of
California,s restructured power industry.  For the first time I see the
method in his madness.  He takes a very political view of things, which
means economics and physics don,t hold a candle to political factors.

We also talked about the power business, movie production (Attack of the
Killer Tomatoes V is coming out soon.  I asked wasn,t ATKT  I through IV
enough?  He said he was going to keep on doing it until he got it
right.  I offered that that was exactly what Glen Campbell said when he
married his fifth wife.), Dennis Miller on Monday Night Football (we
don,t like DM on MNF), and why he ever took an interest in the power
industry (answer: he goes into it and out of our industry from time to
time, just for a visit).

And at the moment, I am working on the Burrito in my DC hotel room,
watching the clock advance into the wee hours of the night.  What,s a
Thursday night without a Burrito to write?  I won't finish this week,s
edition on time.  I only have my travel computer with me.  So, the
Burrito will go out Friday, or Saturday.  Be patient, and don,t get
pushy.  If it,s going to take another week to declare George W the new
President, assuming the Florida vote remains stable, then you can wait a
day or two for the Burrito.

By the way.  Last week,s Burrito was a great companion for those of you
without much humor in your life.  Pity.  Many of the newer readers
lapped up the ISO Going Out of Business items.  One reader wanted to
know if they could purchase the Market Power Exercise Bike in
California, export to Oregon where it sells for ten times the price, and
then bring it back in the State.  I said you could do that, but it would
be wrong.  I would report that person to the Market Surveillance
Committee, and as punishment that person would have to read every
document the ISO,s Department of Market Analysis ever wrote.  Some
aren,t even colored in yet.

Here is this week,s menu.

The Public Relations department in Enron Europe distributes an electronic
newsletter to staff as a means of providing quick up-to-the-minute
information about commercial and non-commercial activities in Europe.  The
newsletter, which is circulated currently to the London, Oslo, Frankfurt,
Madrid, Moscow, Geneva, Helsinki, Singapore, Warsaw, Teesside and Stockholm
offices, is a mix of Enron Europe business highlights, notable quotes about
Enron in the press and other general items of interest on activities in the
London office and throughout Europe.

Please notify Tracy Ralston on +44-20-7783-6611 or by e-mail, if you would
like to receive a copy of this newsletter and be added to the regular
distribution list.  A copy of the most recent newsletter, which is called
EuroFlash!, is below for your review.







BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Enron Metals Branding
Work to re-position MG as Enron Metals is well underway in the UK and will
shortly be underway at Enron Metals offices around the world.  Any member of
staff who has a question about branding or name changes should contact Fiona
Grant in Public Relations.

Croatia
The mid-term power sales agreement between Enron and Croatian utility HEP is
due to be signed tomorrow (Wednesday) at an official ceremony and press
conference in Zagreb.  Enron is also participating in the annual Zagreb Trade
Fair this week.

EBS
Enron Broadband Ventures (EBV), the investment arm of Enron Broadband
Services, announced its first investment in Europe this week.  As part of a
consortium of venture capital funds, EBV is helping provide development
funding for Interxion, a Dutch Internet infrastructure provider.  Interxion
operates a growing number of carrier-neutral Internet exchanges (IECs) in
Europe and is planning to develop new centres in Madrid, Milan, Zurich,
Munich, Helsinki and at Hilversum in the Netherlands.  "This investment is
part of our strategy to invest in emerging communications and technology
companies where EBV can leverage EBS's knowledge and resources" explained
Andrew Marsden, European Head of Enron Broadband Ventures.


A TECHNOLOGY UPDATE FROM IT'S MARK PICKERING. . .

Sametime, a new communication tool, is coming to screens across Europe and,
in the future, throughout Enron's offices worldwide.   What is Sametime? It's
a simple tool that integrates with Lotus Notes to allow you to send and
receive text messages to/from Enron colleagues. Sametimeis not a replacement
for email or the phone, but rather it should complement both exiting
communication tools. This is a tool that will be of most value to people who
spend a lot of time at their PC, but who want to ask a question of someone,
conduct a simple conversation or send a message in real time, without having
to pick up the phone or compose an email message.
Sametimegives users instant messaging capabilities. The green square tells
you who is online and able to receive a message, while the red dot gives a
simple indication of people who may be away from their desk (see screen
sample below).
I use the system everyday and find it invaluable in communicating with my
team. It also comes into its own when communicating with people in other
offices, especially Houston (you can even use it on the road!). A nice
feature is that you can fire off a message to someone and know it will sit on
their screen until they read it.  Sametime'susefulness falls under the
+Network, effect, i.e. the more people online, the greater the benefit.
Sametime will be available on your desktop in the not too distant future, so
watch out for further details.  Looking forward to sametiming with you soon!





IT TECHNOLOGY SHOWCASE

Don't forget, the IT Technology Showcase is coming up on the 20th - 21st this
month!  Get ready for an amazing tour of the latest technology on offer to
you here at Enron House.  Of interest to all who can't leave home without
their mobile phone -- there will be presentations on Evolving Mobile
Technology in the Auditorium on  Wednesday, 20th September.  All presentation
attendees will be entered into a prize draw to win a mobile phone handset
(please contact Alex Dyer for a copy of the agenda and to book your place).


CHAIRMAN'S AWARD NOMINATIONS

Don't forget to send in your nominations for this year's Chairman's Award.
The deadline for submissions is 1 October.  We'll be distributing nominations
forms during the all-employee meeting on 27 September, but in the meantime,
please go to www.enron.com to learn more about the nominations process and to
download a form.  Remember, we need to hear from you in order to recognise
all our European heroes!

ENRON NIGHT AT THE RACES MAKES AN IMPACT IN THE COMMUNITY

Last month the Enron Social Committee hosted an evening at the Greyhound
Races in Wimbledon.  The proceeds of the evening, combined with a 'matching'
donation from Enron, raised o1,600 for The Battersea Dogs' Home.  With the
charity spending an average o530 per dog that comes into the home, the money
was gratefully received by BDH.  Thanks to all who helped make a difference!

QUIZ OF THE WEEK

A man asks his friend to guess the ages of his three nieces. The uncle gives
his friend a clue: the product of the nieces' ages is 2450.

Being a smart guy the friend concludes after some math work that he needs
some additional information.
He is told that the sum of the nieces' ages equals his house number.

After a while he once again asks for an additional clue. The uncle tells him
that all the nieces are younger than himself (the friend).

How old is the friend?
And in what house number does he live?

(with thanks to Gunvor Bay from the Oslo office for providing the Quiz of the
Week)


AND THE WINNER OF LAST WEEK'S QUIZ IS. . .

Congratulations to Adam Kodish for being last week's Riddle of the Day
winner.  The answer to the riddle was 'surname'!

Now back to Beta stuff.The Gordo's idea for Thursday night has  been
enthusiastically endorsed by all those that have responded. John  Grumbles
has volunteered to arrange seating for us there, so let John know if  you're
going to join us: John_Grumbles@berryplastics.comso  he will have an idea
how many to plan on. We'll get back to you with a time to  meet there and the
new address.

Woody's the man for game tickets: boethia@hotmail.com Let him know how
many you need.

Anybody bringing kids? Carl Hohl is too and would like to talk to you  about
related issues: handshohl@eudormail.com

Chuck Paul was at the stadium opener and thinks it would be a good idea to
have a designated "Beta Tent". We can meet there before  and after the
game. It should attract any other Betas in attendance that  have not
received these mailings.Could be some pleasant surprises. He  thinks it
would cost about $100. I said we could pass the hat at Elvis'  party and
cough that up...no problem. What do you think? Let Chuck  know:

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I received a call from a permit engineer with the Arizona Dept. of
Environmental Quality (ADEQ) concerning the issue of notification of
mechanical activities at C/S 2  Flagstaff and a mandatory 7 day wating period
for agency review and approval.   Due to the urgency of the C/S 2 work being
performed, I had written a notification to the agency friday evening
requesting approval to initiate the activities detailed in the scope of work
which was included with the letter.  On Monday, the engineer called and said
that he had read the letter and had no problems with the activity proceeding
at the C/S.  After we had discussed this issue at some length, I posed the
question to him of whether it was necessary to notify the agency of
mechanical and maintenace activities which  will not impact or change a
combustion units throughput, fuel use, emissions, horsepower, or cause a
change in design.  After some discussions I informed him that Transwestern
will probably inundate the agency with notification letters, he stated that
as long as the engines operating parameters would not change, ( horsepower,
emissions, throughput, fuel use etc), and the burden of responsibility will
rest on Transwestern to ensure that no permit conditions are violated, he
stated that we may proceed with these types of activities in Arizona without
any notification to the agency.

The only hitch being, that when Transwestern does a major mechanical
activity, which would cost more than  25-30% of the cost of replacing a unit,
that we provide them a courtesy notification.  I told them we would apprise
them of such an activity.....

Duke Stands By California Market

In the midst of much uncertainty surrounding California's power situation,
Duke Energy North America Monday reiterated its commitment to the state's
struggling wholesale electricity market, announcing new bilateral power deals
with Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and progress with redevelopment plans at
three coastal power plant sites it is operating.

"Duke is committed to continue playing a major role to help California
address its electricity shortfall and the high prices many felt this summer,"
said Bill Hall, Duke's vice president for the western region in North
America, noting that brownfield projects in California have turned out to be
more difficult than new plants to site, based on Duke's experience over the
last three years.

In response to questions, Hall acknowledged that Duke is constantly
reassessing its position in California and a return by the state energy
officials to a cost-based regulated market would cause him a lot of concern,
but he is confident at this point that for the long-term market solutions
will be applied. He said in his meetings with state political and regulatory
leaders he is convinced they know the state can't turn back to a traditional
command-and-control regulatory structure and they recognize that "multiple
solutions" are needed, including balancing supply/demand for power.

"We believe that new generation coming on line throughout the West in the
next few years will lessen the market volatility and markets will begin to
react based on supply/demand stability," Hall said.

Both Hall's and Duke's western trading executive, Nancy DeSchane, said they
are very anxious to see what the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
releases Wednesday with its initial draft decision on what it will do to
address California wholesale electricity prices, including whether it intends
to extend the California Independent System Operator's (Cal-ISO's) authority
to impose price caps.

Hall said Duke has signed a series of "substantial long-term wholesale
electricity contracts" with PG&E's utility that will "help stabilize the
price volatility for the distributor's retail customers." He would not
disclose the terms of the deal, including the volumes and duration, but said
the supplies are slated to be received in the state's northern zone (NP-15).
Earlier Duke offered California utilities five-year deals at $50/MWh. Duke's
Salt Lake City-based trading arm is doing the deal, rather than its
California-based generation plants, meaning the power could come from sources
inside or outside of the state.

Hall said Duke has begun work with local city officials in the San Diego
suburb of Chula Vista to accelerate the current schedule for replacing the
South Bay Power Plant, which Duke leases with an option to buy. "We hope
within the next year we'll be able to announce what we can do to expedite the
replacement of this facility," he said.

Following approvals from the state and a local water permit last week, Duke
will begin its $500 million modernization of Moss Landing Power Plant along
the north central coast "within the next 30 to 60 days," Hall said. The
upgrade will add 1,060 MW to the site's current 1,500-MW capacity and will
require a 30-40% increase in the plant's natural gas requirements, which
PG&E's gas utility assures can be handled by the existing pipeline
infrastructure.

"We've had discussions with PG&E, and we're obviously concerned that we have
sufficient infrastructure to transport gas that we purchase into the system,"
Hall said. "We're confident that their infrastructure can support Moss,"
although, he added, that statewide "we certainly have concerns about the gas
infrastructure" and Duke is working with state officials to assure there are
adequate gas supplies.

"We had some problems this summer in Southern California, and San Diego Gas
and Electric recently announced it is going to begin an intense look at what
needs to be done to upgrade its (gas pipeline) infrastructure to support the
new generation plants coming on board."

Salt Lake City-based DeSchane said Duke has a "balanced" portfolio of supply
and storage contracts, noting that she thinks her company has a "very strong
physical position in the West for gas," and the trading unit will be working
over the next couple of years "to assure that the gas position is sustained
and continues to grow."

Down the central coast about 80 miles at Morro Bay, Duke has resubmitted
revised plans for totally replacing the 1950s-era power plant in a renovation
that will build a new $600 million 1,200-MW plant. With prompt state
approvals, Hall said Duke could bring the new plant online by the summer of
2003 and demolish the existing (1,000-MW) plant by 2007, adding that PG&E
cannot deliver additional gas supplies so the added output is a product of
the anticipated improved efficiency of the new plant.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


In my summer update about the acquisition of MG Plc and the integration of
the metals business into Enron, I reported that we were aiming to complete
the integration by the end of the year. I am pleased to report that we are
well on the way to meeting this target.

September was a busy month for the metals business as it brought with it both
the co-location of the London and Tokyo-based metals staff with Enron,s
offices and the first quarter of combined reporting under Enron Europe.
Ensuring a smooth transition for both the metals staff and the metals systems
into our London headquarters took a tremendous amount of co-ordination by
teams across the company on the part of the former MG team and the
integration team at Enron Europe.  Nevertheless, &D-Day8 arrived with minimal
problems and the metals team open for business as usual on the morning of
September 18th.

Another key initiative that commenced during September was the re-positioning
of the MG worldwide metals business as Enron Metals. With the exception of
the Henry Bath & Son Limited warehousing division, which will remain as
currently named, the re-branding initiative was kicked off in the UK and
followed by Japan and the US.  The re-branding initiative is on going with
all other remaining regions set to undergo completion of the name change by
the end of November.

Enron Metals is represented throughout the world.  I have attached a regional
office summary that depicts Enron Metals, locations (Appendix I).

In light of the progress that has been made since the summer, I thought it
would be helpful to provide you with a brief recap of Enron Metals, core
business areas and identify those members of the metals team who will be
leading commercial efforts moving forward.

Merchanting Division

The Merchanting Division, led by Michael Farmer (+44 (0)20 7783 2049), is a
worldwide copper merchant, one of the top three independent merchants of
copper concentrates and nickel and the leading European merchant of recycled
non-ferrous metals.  Core activities of the merchanting division are:

Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals ) Enron Metals trades as a principal with
producers and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and
concentrates (particularly copper, aluminum and nickel), exchanging qualities
and locations and lending and borrowing metals.
Global Stockholding ) Through its affiliate, Henry Bath & Son Limited,
Enron Metals holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehouses around the
world.
Merchanting of Recycled Metal ) Enron Metals trades as a principal with
suppliers and consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.  Enron has
augmented its European recycling platform through the acquisition of assets
of W&O Bergmann, the leading German Recycling Business.

Financial Services Division

The Financial Services Division, led by Michael Hutchinson (+44 (0)20 7783
2079), provides market-making and trading services to Enron Metal,s physical
metals trading business through futures trading as a member of the London
Metal Exchange and as a member of COMEX in New York.  The Financial Services
Division will continue to be comprised of brokerage activities for LME and
COMEX contracts and be a market-maker for both futures and options contracts
on the LME and COMEX and in OTC metals contracts.

With much of the metals business moving to online trading, significant effort
has been put into getting metals contracts incorporated into EnronOnline,s
portfolio of product offerings since the metals business, integration into
Enron this summer.  Today on EnronOnline we are trading six metals (Copper,
Aluminium, Nickel, Zinc, Lead and Tin) with over 150 products available.

Enron Metals now has almost 800 financial counterparties on the books, with
300 of these having EnronOnline accounts.  Trading volumes have increased
from a couple of trades per day in September to a high of 300 in October. The
attached charts depict the established metals results compared to the start
up of US natgas (Appendix II).

Origination

Enron Metals established a London-based commercial unit under the direction
of Eric Gadd, Vice President-Global Metals Origination which is focused on
completing highly structured and long-dated transactions.  It will integrate
with existing merchanting and financial service competencies to lever up
earnings creation.  Currently, the origination team is working on a number of
Q4 transactions in Australia and the Americas.  The deal pipeline for Q2 has
prospects in not only these regions but also Europe/Africa and the Middle/Far
East.   Close and regular communication between the metal origination team
and other business units inside Enron is essential if we are to succeed in
building a new capability to achieve earnings targets and deliver shareholder
value through Enron Metals.  Your active involvement and close co-operation
here is appreciated.

Warehousing (Henry Bath & Son Limited)

The Warehousing operations, led by Ed Dablin, operate under the name of Henry
Bath & Son Limited.  Henry Bath has been in business for more than 200 years
and maintains a global operation for the physical handling and storage of
non-ferrous metals, including zinc, tin, copper, nickel, lead and aluminum.
Henry Bath provides support to both the Merchanting and Financial Services
Divisions, and also engages in independent warehousing operations.  Its core
activities include worldwide storage of metals and other products such as
cocoa, general goods and worldwide shipping services.

Presently, Henry Bath maintains over three million square feet of storage
worldwide (most of which is leased), with the largest facilities located in
the United Kingdom (Liverpool, London, Bristol, Immingham), the Netherlands
(Rotterdam), Spain (Bilbao, Barcelona), Singapore, and the United States (New
Haven, New Orleans and Los Angeles).

Rob Soeldner is managing the integration efforts for me.   Please feel free
to contact him at +44 (0)20 7783 7169 with any questions regarding the
business.



Regards
John Sherriff

Here is some feedback I got from within Susman Godfrey:

1.  Morris:  Several people have been before him as a judge or arbitrator
and they all think he is fine.  Recall he also is the one who is a good
friend of Mike Beatty.

2.  Paul:  extremely negative feedback

3.  Roberts:  even worse feedback than Paul.  SG took a very contentious
deposition of him in the Exxon Valdez coverage case.

4.  Webster:  fine; but probably unacceptable to Duke once they know Enron's
and my relationship with him.

5.  Phillips:  Mixed.  Steve Susman likes him and thinks he would be fine.
Others note that he apparently is extremely close to Renfrew, having
strongly urged Renfrew as the neutral arbitrator in a matter in which
Phillips was the (unsuccessful) mediator.

Others note generally the obvious concern that Renfrew may have some special
sway with any former federal judge, a rather small and elite club.

Others noted that we should beware Oklahoma based arbitrators in particular
(Morris, Paul and Phillips all are from Okla.), where Duke is a big player.

With respect to potential counter-proposals, Beatty is considering some
names.  In addition, two people suggested within SG are former state judge
Harlan Martin (who runs JAMS' Dallas office); and former 3rd Circuit judge
Arlin Adams (who ruled in SG's favor as sole arbitrator in our dispute with
Jack Grynberg).

these are neat.
regards.  scott.
FIVE GREAT LESSONS:
1 -   Most Important Lesson - During my second month of nursing school, our
professor gave us a pop quiz. I was a conscientious student and had breezed
through the questions,until I read the last one: "What is the first name of
the woman who cleans the school?" Surely this was some kind of joke. I had
seen the cleaning woman several times.  She was tall, dark-haired and in her
50s, but how would I know her name?  I handed in my paper, leaving the last
question blank. Just before class ended, one student asked if the last
question would count toward our quiz grade. "Absolutely," said the professor.
"In your careers, you will meet many people. All are significant. They
deserve your attention and care, even if all you do is smile and say
'hello'." "I've never forgotten that lesson.  I also learned her name was
Dorothy.
2 - Second Important Lesson - Pickup in the Rain. One night, at 11:30 PM, an
older African American woman was standing on the side of an Alabama highway
trying to endure a lashing rain storm. Her car had broken down and she
desperately needed a ride. Soaking wet, she decided to flag down the next
car.  A young white man stopped to help her, generally unheard of in those
conflict-filled 1960s. The man took her to safety, helped her get assistance
and put her into a taxi cab. She seemed to be in a big hurry, but wrote down
his address and thanked him. Seven days went by and a knock came on the man's
door. To his surprise, a giant console color TV was delivered to his home. A
special note was attached. It read: "Thank you so much for assisting me on
the highway the other night. The rain drenched not only my
clothes, but also my spirits. Then you came along. Because of you, I was able
to make it to my dying husband's bedside just before he passed away.  God
bless you for helping me and unselfishly serving others." Sincerely, Mrs. Nat
King  Cole.
3 - Third Important Lesson - Always remember those who serve. In the days
when an ice cream sundae cost much less, a 10 year old boy entered a hotel
coffee shop and sat at a table.  A waitress put a glass of water in front of
him.
"How much is an ice cream sundae?" he asked. "Fifty cents," replied the
waitress. The little boy pulled his hand out of his pocket and studied the
coins in it. "Well, how much is a plain dish of ice cream?" he inquired. By
now more people were waiting for a table and the waitress was growing
impatient. "Thirty-five cents," she brusquely replied." The little boy again
counted his coins.  "I'll have the plain ice cream," he said.  The waitress
brought the ice cream, put the bill on the table and walked away. The boy
finished the ice cream, paid the cashier and left. When the waitress came
back, she began to cry as she wiped down the table. There, placed neatly
beside the empty dish, were two nickels and five pennies - You see, he
couldn't have the sundae, because he had to have enough left to leave her a
tip.
4 -  Fourth Important Lesson - The Obstacle in Our Path. In ancient times, a
King had a boulder placed on a roadway. then he hid himself and watched to
see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the king's wealthiest
merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it.  Many loudly
blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about
getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load
of vegetables. Upon
approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move
the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he
finally succeeded.  After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he
noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse
contained many gold coins and a note from the king  indicating that the gold
was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant
learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an
opportunity to improve our condition.
5 - Fifth Important Lesson - Giving When it Counts. Many years ago, when I
worked as a volunteer at a hospital, I got to know a little girl named Liz
who was suffering from a rare and serious disease. Her only chance of
recovery appeared to be a blood transfusion from her 5-year old brother, who
had miraculously survived the same disease and had developed the antibodies
needed to combat the illness. The doctor explained the situation to her
little brother, and asked the little boy if he would be willing to give his
blood to his sister. I saw him hesitate for only a moment before taking a
deep breath and saying, "Yes, I'll do it if it will save her." As the
transfusion progressed, he lay in bed next to his sister and smiled, as we
all did, seeing the color returning to her cheeks. Then his face grew pale
and his smile  faded. He looked up at the doctor and asked with a trembling
voice, "Will I start to die right away?" Being young, the little boy had
misunderstood the doctor; he thought he was going to have to give his sister
all of his blood in order to save her. You see, after all, understanding and
attitude, are everything.

Two sisters, one blonde and one brunette, inherit the family ranch.
Unfortunately, after just a few years, they are in financial trouble.

In order to keep the bank from repossessing the ranch, they need to
purchase a bull so that they can breed their own stock. The brunette balances
their checkbook, then takes their last $600 dollars out west to another
ranch where a man has a prize bull for sale.

Upon leaving, she tells her sister, "When I get there, if I decide
to buy the bull, I'll contact you to drive out after me and haul it home."

The brunette arrives at the man's ranch, inspects the bull, and decides
she does want to buy it. The man tells her that he can sell it for $599,
no less. After paying him, she drives to the nearest town to send her
sister a telegram to tell her the news.

She walks into the telegraph office, and says, "I want to send a
telegram to my sister telling her that I've bought a bull for our ranch. I
need her to hitch the trailer to our pick-up truck and drive out here so we
can haul it home."

The telegraph operator explains that he'll be glad to help her,
then adds, It's just 99 cents a word."

Well, after paying for the bull, the brunette only has $1 left. She
realizes that she'll only be able to send her sister one word.

After thinking for a few minutes, she nods, and says, "I want you to send
her the word, 'comfortable'."

The telegraph operator shakes his head. "How is she ever going to know that
you want her to hitch the trailer to your pick-up truck and drive out
here to haul that bull back to your ranch if you send her the word,
'comfortable'?"

The brunette explains, "My sister's a blonde. She'll read it slow."

I talked with Chairman Schriber this morn to give him a heads-up on the
meeting Barbara and I are having with the Governor's Chief of Staff in
follow-up to Ken Lay and Governor Taft's conversation on transmission
access.  (We are going to try and get Taft to push for Ken Lay to be the
keynote speaker at the NGA in February).

Schriber indicated that beginning next month, he plans to make transmission
issues a top priority since he believes that to be the largest impediment to
competition.  He thinks we need to create a secondary market and that all the
acamedicians are making this more complex than it needs to be.  We also
talked about about the native load language in the settlements.  I  offered
to have Enron come in and talk to him about our vision on how the
transmission system should work and he was very enthusiastic and said he
would give us a full day if we needed it.

My assessment is that Schriber is a little naive about the ease with which a
solution can be developed but that he is genuinely interested in being
proactive and taking a position which potentially may not be very different
from ours.  (The meeting with him will help ferret that out).

My recommendation is that we set up a meeting with him for mid-December and
go through our issues in a Transmission101 format, since I think he needs to
go up the learning curve.

Schriber indicated he would try to attend the Nov. 14th meeting in Indy, but

ENRON ANOUNCES EMPLOYEE PROGRAM
On October 5, Enron announced "it will give employees of its wholly owned
subsidiaries a high-speed computer and Internet connection, including
broadband connectivity, for use at home, beginning in 2001.   .......Through
a company-wide computer drive, employees will be able to donate their
existing home computers to Technology For All (www.techforall.org) , a
national program working to bridge the digital divide."   Technology For All
thanks Ken Lay for his leadership in this decision that also helps TFA serve
America's underserved and disadvantaged.
For more information, the full press release is located at
http://www4.enron.com/corp/pr/releases/2000/ene/87-PC-Enron.html .


$45 MILLION SMARTFORCE DONATION TO BE ANNOUNCED NOVEMBER 15
On November 15 TFA and SmartForce
(http://www.smartforce.com/corp/marketing/default.htm ) will post a joint
press release announcing the donation of 450,000 scholarships for SmartForce
eLearning courses to be delivered through the TFA secure website to end
users seeking training with TFA collaborative program partners across the
US.  The 600 online courses available through the program are in English and
Spanish and include everything from computer basics to various levels of
technical certification. This generous gift to TFA will be utilized over a
three year period and has a retail value of approximately $45 million. A key
component of the gift will be the inclusion of a "SmartJobs" section on the
web site that will list companies doing business with SmartForce that have
pledged to interview job applicants who successfully complete training
through a TFA/SmartForce course. Scott Yeager will call Greg Priest, CEO of
Smarforce, on behalf of TFA and thank him for this generous gift toward the
Technology For All initiative.

AMERICA CONNECTS CONSORTIUM
TFA is working with the America Connects Consortium (ACC) to help support
Community Technology Centers across the US. The ACC received recently
received a $2 million Department of Education  grant to support CTC efforts.
The benefits to TFA include program support for existing TFA programs and
the ability to share best practices across the US. The consortium will
assist TFA in its city by city model by helping encourage exisiting
organizations to work together. In addition to sharing TFA online content
TFA will also host online curriculum resources created by the consortium on
the private side of our web site.  The work of the Consortium will begin
with an organizational meeting in Boston, November 15-16.  For more
information read the full release posted on the TFA web site at.
http://www.techforall.org/showdoc.cfm?id=35&ret=new

BLUECURRENT RELATIONSHIP FINALIZED
TFA recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Bluecurrent.  Through
the relationship Bluecurrent will assist TFA with the management and
donation of corporate technology assets across the US.  Through the creative
use of donated assets as "currency" the Bluecurrent relationship will save
TFA $13.5 million in projected cash expenses over the next five years to
process and redeploy corporate technology assets donated to TFA.  In
addition, we believe this relationship will dramatically increase the
computers available to TFA and its program partners.  For more information
about Bluecurrent go to http://www.bluecurrent.com .

LINCT COALITION "LEARN AND EARN" PROGRAM TO EMPOWER
One of the beneficiaries of the Bluecurrent relationship will be the ability
of TFA to more quickly rollout the TFA/LINCT coalition "Learn and Earn"
Program. This program will allow disadvantaged persons who participate in
the program to learn how to use a computer and then mentor another person
using the same curriculum. By completing both parts of this cross-age peer
tutoring program, participants will then "earn" a computer to take home,
thus creating new opportunities for education and economic empowerment.
More information about the LINCT coalition "learn and earn" program can be
found at http://www.linct.org/

DIGITAL DIVIDENDS CONFERENCE, SEATTLE
Two weeks ago I attended the Digital Dividends Conference in Seattle.  The
focus of the Conference was "creating digital dividends" and exploreing
innovative approaches to closing the global digital divide.  The conference
was hosted by the World Resources Institute, chaired by William D.
Ruckelshaus, and reviewed business modesl and market development strategies
to close the digital divide.  I made several important connections at the
conference including key personnel with Hewlett Packard.  Carly Fiorina,
HP's CEO, announced a huge global initiative by Hewlett Packard to address
the digital divide in 1000 villages across the world.

ASIA FOUNDATION RELATIONSHIP BEING DEVELOPED
Through the introduction of Enron lobbyist David Merrill, former ambassador
to Bangladesh during the Bush adminstration, TFA met last week with the
President and several staff members of the Asia Foundation. The Asia
Foundation supports economic development and other efforts in Asia and is
funded by private contributions and the US State Department. The Asia
Foundation indicated an interest in working together with TFA in the future
as Enron expands its backbone to Japan and other Asian countries.

LAY AND TROTTER ASSIST IN FUNDRAISING EFFORTS
TFA and its local affiliate Technology For All-Houston are working together
to follow through on grant requests of $5 million over a three year period
from Houston area foundations.  We have had initially o\positive responses
from Houston Endowment and the Brown Foundation as well as several smaller
foundations including the Hamman Foundation and the Sterling Turner
Foundation. We are also preparing requests to Houston area corporations and
friends of TFA that will go out in the next few weeks.  A bridge loan from
the Redstone bank has been secured to get us through the next couple of
months. TFA anticipates a need for $4.5 million in cash over the next twelve
months to help us build capacity and long term sustainability.  With the
creative business relationships being created we expect to be able to insure
sustainability of the organization after the initial capacity is secured.
However, until that time, TFA will be dependent upon the cash and in-kind
contributions of foundations, corporations, its board members and friends.

PROGRESS CONTINUES ON IVERCITY DEAL
The IverCity "deal" is an example of an innovative and creative solution for
long-term sustainability.  Through the co-branding of the TFA/IverCity web
site, we hope to drive web users to IverCity content and thus create the
potential for a IverCity liquidity event that will benefit TFA's long term
capital needs.  Jack Clark has done a superb job creating the draft of the
legal document outlining the deal.  We thank Jack Trotter for his suggestion
to create a convertible royalty rather than just equity by itself.  The
benefit to TFA is the ability for TFA to be compensated by the number of
users we direct to the IverCity content which will be useful to TFA
constituents.

ROSEMARIE FOSTER TO JOIN TFA AS ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT
Effective, November 20, Rosemarie Foster will be joining the TFA staff
fulltime as administrative assistant.  She will begin working some partime
hours this week. Thanks to Jack Trotter and Jack Clark for providing office
space for Rosemarie.  Additional TFA staff are being c\interviewed to assist
with fund-raising, program development, web site development and network
infrastructure support.

DISCUSSIONS WITH INTERNET POLICY INSTITUTE
Justin Cornett represented TFA recently at a "town hall" meeting of the
Internet Policy Institute (IPI) in Austin.  The IPI will be working with TFA
in our Washington DC rollout. We will be meeting with them again next week
in DC. We thank Ken Lay for his initial introductions to the board members
and staff of the IPI.

NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, WASHINGTON DC, SAN DIEGO, ATLANTA
Through introductions from TFA board members and others we are beginning to
develop key contacts in each of the cities noted above. Board assistance
will be required as we also seek to develop co-branding corporate
relationships.  As per the wishes of the board, we are focused on New York,
Washington DC, and Los Angeles first.  We will keep you posted and request
your assistance as appropriate.

ROAD-SHOW.COM DONATES WEBCAST PRODUCTION
Road-Show.com, an Enron customer, recently donated a webcast for TFA to
utilize on its website.  The url for the site is listed below and will soon
be accessible from TFA's web site as well.

cap's OK," then we can likely persuade him.  Tim: Be useful to know as soon
as possible if the alternative Steve suggests below (i.e., >$150 bids with no

FYI, Enron has been a member of this group (ACI), either as EES/ENA or
Transwestern Pipeline/Gas Pipeline Group.  I think we have NOT paid dues this
year,  but if you want to call on them, they may want us to pay up (not a
problem in my opinion).  Also be aware that the pipeline group will probably
have Tom Rutherford on retainer this year for our legislative session, and
you may want to retain him as well to keep on the lookout for your issues.
He has represented us in the electric issues in the past too, and is a great
lobbyist.  His number is 505 265 7129.  I don't have ACI's number at the

help you in any way.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Hey Guys,  I just typed a small novel (below) about JRTC and thought I send
it out, it's answerin a question a friend asked about how the simulated
comabt stuff works and has an example at the end.




Excellent question (about what makes the bad guys run away during an
exercise).


The Army paid Grumman a shitload of cash to make "laser tag" stuff for us.

It's called MILES and if you ever see a picture of an army unit on an
exercise you will see that the soldier is wearing a harness over his normal
Load Bearing Vest(LBV), the harness has four receptors on the front and four
on the back, in addition there is a doughnut shaped belt of receptors that
goes on the kevlar helmet.  Vehicles also have receptors mounted to them,
every thing from HMMV's to the tanks to the helicopters.

Our weapons systems have transmitters on them, it'll look like a little box
mounted on the front of the weapon, the box has a pressure sensor so every
time the gas from a blank round firing hits it it fires a laser beam down
range.  If the laser beam strikes a receptor the guys harness will emit this
God awful high pitched whine that lets everyone know he is down/dead.
AT-4's and Dragons (bazooka like anti-armor weapons) are simulated by what
are called Vipers, same weight, same size, except it fires a big powerful
laser that will be strong enough to activate an enemy tanks MILES.  The
armor vehicles MILES game is pretty neat.  There are two types of kills on a
tank, a Mobility kill, and a critical kill.  If the Viper or other weapon
doesn't have a solid hit on a sensor in a critical area, a mobility kill
will result which means the explosion just blew the trak of the vehicle but
its' radios and weapons still work.  A critical kill means, the vehicle and
all inside are dead dead dead.  If a tank gets a critical kill the MILES
gear will actually shut the vehicle down and kill its radios.  The guy will
just be drivin along and then he will hear over his radio a females voice
say, "Critical kill" and the only thing that will work on the vehicle after
that are the brakes.

So, direct fire weapons systems are pretty easy to replicate, target wears a
receptor, shooter fires a transmitter.

Indirect fire weapons though are a bit more difficult,  whereas before the
shooter always had eyes on the target and thus could directly place a laser
beam on target, artillery often shoots targets that no one directly see.

There are two ways around this.   At the National Training Center (NTC)
where they do all the armor against armor training, they have the MILES 2000
system.  You have an armored motorized rifle company(MRC) sitting at point
X,  I have an observer 15Km away who, with optics can see your
MRC, my FO calls in a fire mission, based on the target description a Bn 3
will be fired (54 rounds fired in 3 volleys as there are only 18 tubes in a
Bn.  The Observer-Controllers (OCs), kinna like referees, will monitor the
Call for Fire from the observer to the tubes, and the OCs will take the fire
mission data and plug it into their big MILES computer which will take into
account any errors the observer may have made and any errors the gun
batteries (instead of Artillery Companies we have artillery Batteries (6
guns)) may have made.  When the gun batteries tell the observer that they
have pulled the trigger, the OCs, who are always listening, will pull the
Miles trigger.  What happens then is a satellite hovering above NTC will
blast down a laser with a footprint large enough to simulate the area 18
artillery rounds would take up, it will do this 3 times to simulate all 3
volleys landing.  Any vehicles caught in this footprint will be assessed as
damaged/destroyed.

At JRTC where the Light Fighters (i.e. no armor assets organic to them)
learn to play,  we don't get no stinkin satellites.  What we do there is,
when a fire mission is called to the guns, the OCs will monitor it and enter
the data in their computers, the computer will take into account any errors
made by the FO and the guns and will spit out a grid coordinate,  this grid
will be passed to a "Fire Marker" which is a crazy guy with a four wheeler,
a GPS, and a god gun (a hand held transmitter that fires a universal kill
laser i.e. men to tanks and aircraft).  I say crazy because these guys are
civilians who get bonuses based on how fast they can get to the target grid.
Their average response time is 4 1/2 minutes, which is about 3 minutes
longer then it would be in real life so it's not as cool as MILES 2000.  So
you'll see these guys haulin ass through the woods on theses 4 wheelers
tryin to get to their target grids on time, and God help you if he pulls up
into your position and no you can't haul ass if you see one comin your way
cause your OC who is walkin with your unit will zap you on the spot if he
sees you runnin from a fire marker.  I'll close this bad boy with a little
story.

"Oh shit, there I was" (all good 'war' stories gotta start with this).
We had started the first phase of the rotation, "Entry into the Box" (the
box is the JRTC engagement area) at 2300hrs the previous night and had
fought our way 7 Km SW hand railing a road, identifying mine/wire obstacles
and eliminating the Observers over watching them.  It was 0800 the next
morning and we were dead f-kin tired and had finally reached our main
objective which was a road inter-section in a semi wooded area just to the
south of the main air field that the rest of the Brigade Combat Team (BCT)
was gonna use to lift in the rest of the support assets.  There was a BIG
triangular berm area just off the road, basically the dirt walls were 10 ft
tall 50 yard long.  We moved out of the tree line and occupied it cause at
the time it looked like it would be super easy to defend, which was good
cause we needed to hole up for a bit and catch out breath, plus our COLT
team (Combat Observer Laser Team = mounted (on a HMMVV) FO's with Laser
designators to guide Copperheads and Hellfire missiles, basically vehicle
killers) and Bradley support vehicles had just 'discovered' (BOOM) a mine
field at the intersection, this was happening as we were occupying the berm.
So we detached a small element to go evac the Casualties from the
vehicles, the 1SG and a couple of joes. 3 min later the 1SG and his team
were nailed by anti-personnel mines surrounding the mine field while trying
to aid the wounded inside the vehicles.  At the same time a "Civilian" truck
with two redneck lookin females showed up like they were fixin to drive
right on through the road so we had to send a few guys out of the berm to
stop/search the vehicle (at JRTC they employ real civilian actors to portray
Civilians on the Battlefield or COBs, because in real life there are COBs
and we gotta know how to deal with them and accomplish our mission at the
same time).  So we got the 1SG and a couple of guys down at the obstacle, a
COB truck right outside the berm when the CO decides to go check on the
obstacle.  By this time we had been in this BIG berm (read TRP (Target
Reference Point or somethin the enemy probably has his guns laid on just
waitin for some morons to park their sad tired asses in there long enough to
get a mission off)) for like 15 minutes when sure enough off in the distance
we hear this vrrrrrm getting steadily louder and louder.  We were so tired
we were basically denying the obvious, "there's no way he's headed for us,
please God don't let him be headed for us" basically you had an entire
company in a 100 yard radius which is about the same size as a 82mm mortar
impact area.  So there we are listening to this 4 wheeler get closer and
closer and basically all we can do is start to get all our gear back on and
get ready to HAUL ass.  Of course we can't legally run until the first round
impacts.  So this guys comes tearin down the road, shoots off the road and
pulls SMACK DAB into the middle of the berm, jumps off his bike and starts
UNLOADING with air burst Arty Simulators (basically a little flare gun that
pops 1/4 sticks of TNT up 40 ft into the air to simulate incoming rounds.
Note: these are only used when the grid is so accurate that using ground
burst simulators would pose a hazard to troops).  Basically what this told
us is that we were setup, the baddies were just waitin for us cause the
rounds were accurate on the first volley and needed no adjustment.  So yeah,
this joker is poppin off airburst TNT, after the first burst I yelled
INCOMING and got up and hauled ASS.  Luckily I was close to the exit and
started movin out FAST, because between airbursts the Fire Marker was just
sweeping left to right with the God gun as guys were scramblin tryin to get
out.  I got out of the Berm and just kept runnin a good 200M because I'm
Artillery and I know what the burst radius is on these suckers.  I looked
back and saw the Infantry guys stoppin at a tree just outside the berm.
Since there were no visible Real life ground bursts they thought they were
safe.  As I was yellin at them to keep movin an OC came out and just whacked
em all (16 guys).  As the rest of the people who made it out were still
runnin, about 25 of us and we were all now 150-200M North of the berm,
scattered all over hell.  Little bunches of 5-6 guys runnin to trees and
collapsing.  Just as the last of the living made it out of the berm, we hear
this vehicle come tearing outta the trees about 50M to our left and from
lower ground.  Sure enough it's a DsHKA (read Dishka, basically a 50 Cal on
a friggin truck bed),  so there this fucker is lighting us up from the left
and enemy 82mm Mortar fire blastin our tail ends.  Since the DsHKA was a
high payoff TGT I was immediately on my net sreamin "Holy Shit we got a
DsHKA here, Grid 785436 HELLLLPPPP!!!"  At the same time we got Infantry
guys tryin to suppress the joker on the back of truck with their M4's while
trying to get two Vipers together (we were told by the OC's that the only
thing they've ever seen kill vehicle here with was two Vipers fired at the
same section of the vehicle at exactly the same time)  but the Viper teams
were scattered all over hell.  All this happened within about 30 seconds,
the CO had seen us come tearin outta the Berm and heard the DsHKA light up
so he was on his net talkin to the Kiowa's (scout helicopters but they're
armed).  So we're pinned down, trying to suppress this truck while dodgin 50
Cal laser blasts (since its just MILES a blade of grass can deflect the
laser).  FINALLY the Kiowas show up (actually they got there respectably
fast only 2-3 minutes) chase the bastard down and smash him with their
hellfires.  With 30 of 65 guys dead, and one DsHKA down, we were ready to
get a little rest and then start huntin the mortar and other 2 DsHKAs that
were supposed to be in the area.

Basically we got the shit ambushed outta us, it was really a pretty nice
setup on the enemies part.  We were stupid enough to setup in an obvious
terrain feature, one that was no doubt on the Enemy's target lists.  So when
the mortar rounds started droppin and we started pouring out of the berm
there the 50 cal was waitin to mow down whoever didn't get killed by the
Arty.

Anyways, that's one of my JRTC stories and subsequently one of the largest
e-mails I've ever written. So I'm gonna forward it to the rest of the guys.

Welp, its about time to go get my drink on, talk to y'all later.

LAWLER,OUT.

Frank,

I just completed a phone conversation with Mr. Jeffrey M. Tanenbaum, Council
with Littler Mendelson, that you retained to review our ergonomics written
programs and plan for Grandfathering Enron companies. Mr. Tanenbaum appears
to be an excellent choice for this assignment due to his being full time in
the area of OSHA compliance and his business reputation.

I explained in full Enron's position with respect to the existence of written
ergo program procedures as of November 14, 2000 and my actions and plan to
obtain Grandfathering status by January 16, 2001. Mr. Tanenbaum stated he
finds no problem with the plan to achieve this status. He indicated that his
review of the programs should stand for the evaluation of the program
elements, and agreed that the OSHA 200 Log review would cover the remainder
of the evaluation requirement, but suggested this be done under Attorney
Client privilege with him.

He has some minor, to use his words, rework of the programs he will be
forwarding to us. These revisions will need to be integrated into the written
programs before January 16, 2001.

I most appreciate your attention to this matter and the timeliness in
obtaining us a review of our action plan and programs.

Regards,

Russ

I spoke with Kent Harris at Wildhorse today and he stated there position to
me on a few things.
1.  Our Interruptible noms to NWPL for Wed. were not cut due to contractual
reasons, we were cut due to a lack of capacity.  He said that the San Arroyo
#2 compressor was down and without it they cannot make additional deliveries
to NWPL.  They hope to have it up by friday and will try to provide us some
capacity into NWPL.
2.  Kent reiterated their position regarding our contract by stating that
"the intent of the original contract was not to take gas through other
systems other than the Mesa system".  In addition he stated that we do not
have the right to choose which pipeline our gas is delivered to.
3.  He also asked whether or not we were willing to negotiate on the current
situation or if we wanted to let the 'lawyers fight it out".  I reiterated
that we have been waiting for them to either acknowledge that they will
gather the entrada gas under the current contract or provide us with another
alternative.  Absent either of those 2 things happening all we can do is try
to live by the existing agreement.  He stated that they have new estimates on
the cost to construct a new line through the South Canyon and it is
approximately $1MM less than their original esitmate.
We left it that he would determine whether or not they would gather  the
Entrada under the existing contract or make a new proposal that would most
likely wrap the Entrada and Dakota up under one new deal and replace the
existing contract.
I told him we would determine whether or not we wanted to "let the lawyers
fight over the existing contract" or work on a new deal for all the
production.
P.S.  They are still very interested in some type of Joint Venture.

the reasons for cancellation.
As it turns out, his group--Bulk Power Delivery--is not the group executing
the PPA with Enron.  That group is Tim Talmadge's group--Capacity
Acquisition.  Once Wayne tried to schedule the 9/29 meeting, he was told not
to talk with Enron.  Further investigation on his part uncovered some
internal VEPCO issues.  He is calling an internal meeting with Capacity
Acquisition, Bulk Power Delivery, Bulk Power Operations and the Transmission
Group to discuss these issues and establish a consistent "game plan" for
going forward.
The Transmission Group is scheduled to finish the Facility Study on Monday,
October 2, 2000.  The study will include switchyard needs, network needs,
construction costs, and construction schedule.  He knows we have a June 2001
commercial operation date, and he knows that Capacity Acquisition is
responsible for the associated construction costs.  He is nervous that the
Facility Study will forecast construction schedules that do not coincide with
the commercial operation date.  He further indicated that acquisition of
necessary equipment--breakers, transformers, etc. specified by the Facility
Study--could be a significant challenge for VEPCO.  He understands that this
is his challenge, not ours.  He also noted that VEPCO is very sensitive and
careful to operate within FERC guidelines regarding interconnection and the
various time frames--this includes not making any special considerations to
the Capacity Acquisition guys since they are in the same company.
Wayne Duman is very involved in VEPCO's effort to develop an Interconnection
Agreement consistent with FERC.  They are within days of completing this
task--it is in legal review right now.  The current  version of the
Interconnection Agreement is a subsequent generation of the document we
reviewed at the beginning of August.  Wayne understands that the PPA which
VEPCO and Enron are negotiating is contardictory to the "boiler plate"
Interconnection Agreement and needs to be changed to reflect the PPA defined
scopes for Enron and VEPCO.  He indicated that part of VEPCO's "to do list"
to get ready to meet with Enron includes modification of the latest
generation of the VEPCO Interconnection Agreement to be consistent with the
Enron PPA.
He is optimistic that we would be able to meet late next week to get the
Interconnect Agreement process underway.  He assured me that he would keep
Enron informed of the progress.
In summary, VEPCO is doing the following:
getting all stakeholders on the same page,
finishing the Facility Study, and
getting their Interconnection Agreement to agree with the PPA.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


THE FOLLOWING IS FROM AN ACTUAL 1950'S HOME ECONOMICS TEXTBOOK INTENDED FOR
HIGH SCHOOL GIRLS, TEACHING THEM HOW TO PREPARE FOR

MARRIED LIFE:
1. Have dinner ready. Plan ahead, even the night before, to have a delicious
meal - on time. This is a way of letting him know that

you have been thinking about him, and are concerned about his needs. Most
men are hungry when they come home and the prospects of a

good meal are part of the warm welcome needed.

2. Prepare yourself. Take 15 minutes to rest so you will be refreshed when he
arrives. Touch up your make-up, put a ribbon in your

hair and be fresh looking. He has just been with a lot of work-weary people.
Be a little gay and a little more interesting. His

boring day may need a lift.
3. Clear away clutter. Make one last trip through the main part of the house
just before your husband arrives, gather up school

books, toys, paper, etc. Then run a dust cloth over the tables. Your husband
will feel he has reached a haven of rest and order, and

it will give you a lift too.

4. Prepare the children. Take a few minutes to wash the children's hands and
faces if they are small, comb their hair, and if

necessary, change their clothes. They are little treasures and he would like
to see them playing the part.

5. Minimize the noise. At the time of his arrival, eliminate all noise of
washer, dryer or vacuum. Try to encourage the children to

be quiet. Greet him with a warm smile and be glad to see him.

6. Some DON'TS. Don't greet him with problems or complaints. Don't complain
if he's late for dinner. Count this as minor compared

with what he might have gone through that day.

7. Make him comfortable. Have him lean back in a comfortable chair or suggest
he lay down in the bedroom. Have a cool or warm drink

ready for him. Arrange his pillow and offer to take off his shoes. Speak in
a low, soothing and pleasant voice. Allow him to relax

and unwind.

8. Listen to him. You may have a dozen things to tell him, but the moment of
his arrival is not the time. Let him talk first.

9. Make the evening his. Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner
or to other places of entertainment instead try to

understand his world of strain and pressure and his need to be home and
relax.

10. The goal. Try to make your home a place of peace and order where your
husband can relax.

***********************************
THE UPDATED VERSION FOR THE WOMAN OF 2000:
1. Have dinner ready. Make reservations ahead of time. If your day becomes
too hectic just leave him a voice mail message regarding

where you'd like to eat and at what time. This lets him know that your day
has been crappy and gives him an opportunity to change

your mood.

2. Prepare yourself. A quick stop at the Clinique counter on your way home
will do wonders for your outlook and will keep you from

becoming irritated every time he opens his mouth. (Don't forget to use his
credit card.)

3. Clear away the clutter. Call the housekeeper and tell her that any
miscellaneous items left on the floor by the children can be

placed in the Goodwill box in the garage.

4. Prepare the children. Send the children to their rooms to watch television
or play Nintendo. After all, both of them are from his

previous marriage.

5. Minimize the noise. If you happen to be home when he arrives, be in
bathroom with the door locked.

6. Some DON'TS. Don't greet him with problems and complaints. Let him speak
first, and then your complaints will get more attention

and remain fresh in his mind throughout dinner. Don't complain if he's late
for dinner, simply remind him that the leftovers are in

the fridge and you left the dishes for him to do.

7. Make him comfortable. Tell him where he can find a blanket if he's cold.
This will really show you care.

8. Listen to him. But don't ever let him get the last word.

9. Make the evening his. Never complain if he does not take you out to dinner
or other places of entertainment, go with a friend or

go shopping (use his credit card.) Familiarize him with the phrase Girls'
Night Out.

10.The Goal. Try to keep things amicable without reminding him that he only
thinks the world revolves around him. Obviously he's

wrong, it revolves around you.

Ken

I mentioned in a voicemail today that you should be receiving a phone call
from James (Jimbo) Moffet (504) 582-4000.  He is Chairman of Freeport McMahon
in New Orleans.  James had mentioned to Thomas Boettcher & Michael Hutchinson
in our Metals group that he knew you and wanted to make sure you were
supportive of our discussions with them.  Here is the background on a
possible acquisition that we have brought up with them:

Enron Metals is very interested in pursuing further discussions
with Atlantic Copper on the acquisition of their smelter in Spain.  Estimated
capital would be US$350 Million.  Acquiring this asset gives us the
opportunity to build copper and copper concentrate positions and more
effectively managing our positions in the market place. We would finance this
off balance sheet.

Mr. James Targetta, head of Atlantic Copper (copper smelter and refinery in
Spain and fully owned by Freeport McMoran) had a conversation with James
Moffet, Chairman of Freeport McMoran last Friday informing him about our
preliminary conversations.   Moffet advised Targetta not to proceed further
until he speaks to you since he has known you for 25 years.

In addition, Targetta mentioned the possibility for Enron purchasing all the
copper mining activities of  Freeport McMoran which would leave them as an
oil and exploration company.

We think there are some great possibilities here.

If you have not heard from him in the next few days, I would really
appreciate you giving Moffet a call.   I would be more than happy to get a
more extensive briefing for you if you think you need it.   I look forward to
discussing this further with you.

It is with regret that I have accepted Steve Jackson's letter of resignation
from Enron.  Steve has made a choice to leave Enron and to join another
company in the industry.  I know that you will join me in thanking him for
his many years of service to Enron and the contributions that he has made.
His risk expertise and his knowledge of ENA transactions will be missed, as
will his leadership on the gas team.  Although Steve's official last day with
the company is in two weeks, today is his last day in the office.  He will be
available by phone over the next two weeks if there are questions that you
may have on any open items that you were covering with Steve.  Patti has his
home number if you need that.  We will also plan a happy hour for Steve and
we will let you know when and where that will take place.

Effective tomorrow, Jeff Gossett will assume leadership of the gas risk
group, reporting to me.  Jeff will join Bob Hall and Leslie Reeves as
business controllers for Natural Gas, to continue to work together to provide
leadership for the processes, controls, people and systems that support all
aspects of this key business for North America.  Please join me in
congratulating Jeff on his new responsibilities.

He has also asked that we give him the data on the deals that his group has
done that do not have origination.  Therefore,  going forward we will need to
put all deals for Lagrasta's group into the origination file.  Meaning,  if
his group does a deal where no origination is granted,  you will need to put

the Origination granted on the report.  Thanks so much for your help.

Earl that all the agreements are in place. He had contacted Jerry Ball, who
contacted their marketing, and their reply was to tell us (in the field) to
proceed. I tried to explain that we needed that go-ahead from our folks, not
theirs. Also, an issue came up on the operations conference call this morning
about quality equipment - H2S, H2O, Sampler, Gas Chromatograph. The team had
told Rich it was about a 20Mmcfd point, Dirk indicated to me they were
looking at more like 16Mmcfd Commercial power is about a mile away from the
location per the operations team and some of this equipment could require
power.
We have got LOTS going on this week, could someone explain the situation to

I see no problem in obtaining a signature to the Statement currently drafted
for
Eric Tan.  It is his evidence after all and I doubt if there will be much
substance to change.  We can keep it in our files as a privileged document
without any obligation to disclose it.  When we are firmly into the
proceedings,
we shall have to think about disclosing a Statement of Eric Tan if that is
what
we want to do.  It may be, as the case develops, we will want to either delete
or add to the Statement by asking more questions.  For this purpose, it is a
good idea to remain in contact with Eric Tan.  I do not think we need to have
anything as formal as a consulting agreement.  It is just important that one
person makes sure that we know where Eric Tan is at all times in the event
that
we need to contact him.

In the meantime, SRT are going to appoint a UK chemist and are pressing
Mitsubishi very hard now for formal consent to the release of the samples.  I
think I shall firm up on the appointment of the arbitrator (now agreed to by
SRT) when we have the decision on the samples.  Obviously I have pointed out
again on the telephone the potential shelf life problem.

David Best.

At UTC's request, yesterday Mike Jackson and I met with Kent Brittan, VP,
Global Sourcing, and members of his sourcing group.  As you remember, we
first met Kent when Tom White, Dan Leff, Harold Buchanan and I called on him
two years ago.  At the time, we presented an early version of a fully bundled
energy outsource in partnership with Fluor Daniel and a local real estate
management firm.
Over the last two years, UTC attempted various energy procurement strategies,
failing to execute any.
Brittan was very pleased with the content of our revised proposal yesterday,
and told us he would be taking the revised partnership strategy we discussed
directly to George David, CEO.
Brittan will also be taking the preliminary concept to UTC Corporate
Treasury, to gain its buy in on the financing aspects of the deal required to
support the demand side management infrastructure investments it so
desperately needs to affect the energy  consumption reduction to which David
committed two years ago.
Barring a problem there, it appears we have finally engaged UTC in an
exclusive negotiating relationship that would yield a large scale outsource
of energy supply and demand side investment operations in all the UTC
companies, excepting Carrier.    Carrier continues to insist it be treated
separately, and Brittan has decided to carve it out, rather than hold up the
entire deal.  I think that strategy is part of what he will be speaking to
David about.
I requested, and Brittan agreed, that Karl Kropic (COO) be the executive
sponsor.
Mike Jackson who has worked on and off with UTC over the past 18 months will
be the lead Originator for EES moving forward.

Hi everyone.  Hope you all llike this one.  It's sweet.

Love ya'll

Coco

Sally was only eight years old when she heard Mommy and Daddy talking about
her little brother, Georgi. He was very sick and they had done everything
they could afford to save his life. Only a very expensive surgery could help
him now and that was out of the financial question. She heard Daddy say it
with a whispered desperation, "Only a miracle can save him now."

Sally went to her bedroom and pulled her piggy bank from its hiding
place in the closet. She shook all the change out on the floor and
counted it carefully. Three times. The total had to be exactly
perfect. No chance here for mistakes. Tying the coins up in a kerchief, she
slipped out of the apartment and made her way to the corner drug store.

She waited patiently for the pharmacist to give her attention but he was too
busy talking to another man to be bothered by an eight year old.Sally
twisted her feet to make a scuffing noise. She cleared her throat. No
good.Finally she took a quarter from its hiding place and banged it on the
glass counter. That did it!

"And what do you want?" the pharmacist asked in an annoyed tone of voice.
"I'm talking to my brother."

"Well, I want to talk to you about my brother," Sally answered back in the
same annoyed tone. "He's sick ... and I want to buy a miracle." "I beg your
pardon," said the pharmacist. "My Daddy says only a miracle  can save him
now. So how much does a miracle cost?"

"We don't sell miracles here, little girl. I can't help you."

"Listen, I have the money to pay for it. Just tell me how much it
costs."

The well dressed man stooped down and asked, "What kind of a miracle does
your brother need?" "I don't know," Sally answered. A tear  started down her
cheek. "I just know he's really sick and Mommy says he needs an operation.
But my folks can't pay for it, so I have my money.

"How much do you have?" asked the well dressed man. "A dollar and eleven
cents," Sally answered proudly. "And it's all the money I have in the
world."

"Well, what a coincidence," smiled the man. "A dollar and eleven cents--the
exact price of a miracle to save a little brother. "He took her money in one
hand and with the other hand he grasped her mitten and said "Take me to
where you live. I want to see your brother and meet your parents."

That well dressed man was Dr. Carlton Armstrong, renowned surgeon,
specializing in solving Georgi's malady. The operation was completed without
charge and it wasn't long until Georgi was home again and doing well. Mommy
and Daddy were happily talking about the chain of events that had led them
to this place. "That surgery," Mommy whispered. "It's like a miracle. I
wonder how much it would have cost?"

Sally smiled to herself. She knew exactly how much a miracle
cost...one dollar and eleven cents ... plus the faith of a little child.

you is accurate.  A more complete contact sheet with Enron witnesses,
experts etc. will be distributed in the next few days.
Defendants Contact Sheet
Dave Noonan, Mike Kirby, Mike Day and I will try to figure out who
is representing whom in San Diego.
Removal
Diversity
Mike Kirby pointed out that even if we solved the
citizenship issue, it is unlikely that every class member will meet the
$75,000 amount in controversy requirement.  We also have the preliminary
reports that Sempra Energy Resources is a California corporation that is
selling electrical energy into the California PX market. (See December 1
status report.) I need to followup and find out if Sempra Energy Resources
has outside counsel yet and confirm their understanding on this issue.
Federal Question and Related Primary Jurisdiction Argument
All of us need to understand the interrelationship between
the FERC/PUC/ISO investigations and this class action.  There is also the
pending challenge to the ISO MMIP's by Enron and others that has been
pending for some time.  Does the complaint fairly raise or necessarily
implicate a federal question.
Change of Venue  (Additional Research by Peter Meringolo)

I have researched case law involving class actions where class
members are jurors.  I found only two non-California cases, and both involve
change of venue motions.  See Beech v. Leaf River Forest Prods., 691 So. 2d
446 (Miss. 1997); Toledo Fair Hous. Ctr. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 704
N.E.2d 663 (Ohio Ct. Com. Pl. 1996).  These cases, however, do not change
the analysis required under C.C.P. o 397(b).

In Beech, plaintiffs brought a non-class action lawsuit against
defendants for polluting two rivers with dioxin.  Defendants moved for a
change of venue.  In addition to evidence of negative publicity, defendants
showed that of the 8,909 potential jurors, 750 were plaintiffs in other
dioxin cases against these defendants, and "even more were potential class
members in a class action brought against these same defendants" in another
county.  Beech, 691 So. 2d at 450.  The trial court granted defendants'
motion because the negative publicity and the large number of jurors
involved in similar litigation "would prevent the defendants from receiving
a fair trial."  Id.  The Mississippi Supreme Court affirmed, holding that
the trial court did not abuse its discretion.  Id.

Toledo Fair involved a class action against Nationwide Mutual
Insurance Company.  Nationwide moved for a change of venue, arguing, among
other things, that because of the large size of the class "a significant
percentage of veniremen would be either class members or relatives of class
members and would thus be ineligible to sit as jurors."  Toledo Fair, 704
N.E.2d at 664.  Plaintiffs argued that Nationwide exaggerated the size of
the class.  Id.  The court denied the motion, holding that because of the
dispute regarding the size of the class, it was too early to determine
whether an impartial jury could be impaneled.  The court clearly left open
the possibility for Nationwide to renew this motion.

We also discussed the remote possibility of challenging the judge
who would hear this case under Section 170.1, for cause, because the Judge
would be part of the class.  Dave Noonan has had experience in the egg case
with this type of challenge.
Consolidation
Dave and Mike will look at how to manage a consolidation with Judge
Amos under San Diego local rules, if that is what we decided to do.  Keeping
in mind that the 17200 claims are not jury claims, the selection of the
judge is critical.
Coordination with Defense Counsel
Dave and Mike will be responsible with Robin for coordinating among
defense counsel in San Diego.  Right now, we do not intend to enter any
formal defense sharing agreements.
Coordination with Plaintiffs' Counsel
Dave and Mike with Robin will be responsible for coordinating our
efforts with lead plaintiffs' counsel.
Analysis of FERC/PUC Enron Positions
Robin will work with me to understand from Ron Carroll (FERC) and
Mike Day (PUC), what positions that Enron has taken with respect to
jurisdiction etc.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I had a good conversation with Dave Wohlfarth of PSE&G yesterday concerning
the proposed LOI.  He had received comments back  from his Attorney (Ken
Caratta) and had 2 issues he needed to circle back with him on.  These issues
concern the process of approvals by PSEG and ENA of the final Order that
would come from the NJ BPU relating to the transfer of assets over to their
unregulated affiliate "Newco".   Ken is out of the office today but will be
back in Monday.  Dave's target is to get us their comments late on Monday.
He would also like to have a conference call by mid-week to work through the
document with the expectation to have it signed by the end of the week.  We
need to be ready to update our analysis once we receive their revisions to
the LOI.

Concerning the Filing - a Pre-Hearning Conference has been noticed and
scheduled with the Office of Administrative Law Judge for December 19th.  It
is anticipated that the procedual schedule for comments and hearings will be
set at that time.  Dave would like to finish the LOI prior to the hearing.
We will be participating and intervening in the hearings.

Good news on the Genco side of PSE&G - The NJ Supreme Court ruled 4 to 1 to
approve the transfer of the generation assets over to PSEG Power LLC  and the
approximate $ 3 Billion securitization of  "stranded costs" on the assets.
Getting this approve has been important to PSE&G and should help with
precedent on the eventual transfer of the gas assets.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

The Party date has been set...Next Wednesday at Noon we will have the German
Traditional Roof Party and you are all invited!

This party takes place when the framework for the roof is completed.  The roof
meister gives some kind of speech and we take a cut tree for him to put on top
of the roof...i think.  The only roof party that I have ever attended, the
roofer fell off the roof just as the party was to start, this roof was 3
stories
high!  So the party never got off the ground, the emergency medical helicoptor
did eventually get the very broken but not dead roofer out of the cellar
ground
and I never got to see what really should happen (we were just glad the roofer
wasn't dead).

HOPEFULLY, our party will be much less eventful...our house is only 2 stories
high and there is no cellar!

But at noon on Wednesday we will have beer, bratw_rst, bread, sekt and other
beverages for all to enjoy!  Hope to see as many of you as possible there, for
those unable to attend... we will send photos!

Tom Celentano of FERC Energy Markets (in Scott Miller's group) is collecting
informal information about the California market.  He has asked Transwestern
to provide the following information for the gas day of December 7.  He would
like this data in the next few hours (preferrably via fax 202-208-1010):

Capacity available by segment
Whether TW had any curtailments, OFOs, or any other limitations or penalties
in place
Scheduled capacity to the California delivery point by service type
Any nominations which were not confirmed/scheduled at the California delivery
points
Throughput

Initially he also asked for pricing data -- specifically any information that
we have about delivered prices at the California border.  Steve Harris and I
told him that any information we would have on this point would probably be
hearsay or info. from gas daily or EOL sources.    He said he had access to
published data & we could drop this part of the request.

Steve January is working on providing items 1-5.

I am writing to each of you because I need you to be in prayer with me
this week.

For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a
lump I found
under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an
ultrasound of
my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist
this week to
determine if I need to have a biopsy or not.

Since God has given me the task of
doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy.

I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several
months
ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our
family,
we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you
at
this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten
mad.  So he
has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought
down off this
spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God.

That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors
I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on
Thursday
and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy.

God Bless Each of you
and
Season's Greetings

Love

Marylyn

Andrew,
Dan Rogers and I have spoken with Wayne Perry, who is the Enron contact for
the negotiations with Exmar.  He was unaware of this arbitration and believes
that his contacts with Exmar are similarly unaware of it.  Perry will be in
London Wednesday for a conference with Exmar and wants to bring this
arbitration to Exmar's attention, in the hopes that it can be quickly
resolved on a business relationship basis.
At your earliest convenience, would you please e-mail (my first choice) or
telefax (my second choice) to me an executive summary of this matter
(something very succinct, preferably in very easily readable bullet-point
format) with (1) facts, (2) status, (3) best points worst/points, and (4)
recovery/exposure briefly outlined?  Also, would you please advise me who our
opposing solicitor is, and his or her firm?  Last, if you are aware of the
name of the primary Exmar in-house lawyer or business person on this matter.
For this information to have the maximum impact, I need to have it in Perry's
hands before he meets with Exmar, and the sooner before, the better.  Perry
knows that he is not to hand this information over to Exmar, although if you
wanted (and have the time) to make a second executive summary specifically
for him to give to Exmar, that would be fine as well.
Many thanks for your prompt response.  Again, my hope is to try to get this
thing dismissed by year-end.

Here are some edits to our letter from socal.  I do not feel they diminsh
the usefulness of the letter, and they moderate the tone a little, as you
would expect.  They also eliminate the lengthy recitation of the procedural

let's sign.  I will assume everyone who signed on last week stays on the

You Gotta Have Faith


There was this Christian lady that had to do a lot of traveling for her
business, so she did a lot of flying. Flying made her nervous, so she
always took her Bible along with her to read and it helped relax her.

One time, she was sitting next to a man. When he saw her pull out her
Bible, he gave a little chuckle and went back to what he was doing. After
awhile, he turned to her and asked, "You don't really believe all that stuff
in there do you?"

The lady replied, "Of course I do. It is the Bible."
He said, "Well, what about that guy that was swallowed by that whale?"
She replied, "Oh, Jonah. Yes, I believe that, it is in the Bible."
He asked, "Well, how do you suppose he survived all that time inside the
whale?"

The lady said, "Well, I don't really know. I guess when I get to heaven, I
will ask him."
"What if he isn't in heaven?" the man asked sarcastically.
"Then you can ask him." replied the lady.

Tom Beach received the navidad virus in e-mail  yesterday, and it replicated
itself and went out to many (maybe all) of the  people who had sent him
e-mail that he had not yet opened (i.e., unopened mail  in his Outlook

Because the OII and peaking rate filings were  yesterday, you probably sent
Tom e-mail that he didn't have a chance to look  at. If you have a firewall
system that rejects any e-mail with executable  files attached, you're safe.
If you don't, here is the URL with the virus  cure:

In Tom's system, I was able to ignore the error  message about the machine
not being able to find "winsvrc.exe," open  his Internet browser, and
download the virus repair file from this Web  site. It's a relatively easy
fix once that's done.
I'm terribly sorry about this. Let me know  if I can be of further

I believe ENA is still agent for Columbia Energy Services and Columbia Energy

last day is this Friday.  I left Rich a voicemail asking him if CES/CEM

As ENA, I believe I sould at least begin terminating the agency (and

I have today spoken with Dean Vanek, Scottsboro's general counsel, and
advised him that subject to confirmation that all the loads on which Alabama
Carriers is suing are our loads, Enron Metals intends to indemnify and defend
Scottsboro.  I told him that our plan is to retain his usual attorneys to ask
for an extension of time within which Scottsboro should answer, so as to see
whether ICTS will do the right thing and pay off.  If they won't, I told
Vanek our plan to was to have his attorneys negotiate the best possible
settlement.
Vanek told me that Scottsboro had sent all available information to our
Montreal office and that we should check there to confirm that all these
loads were ours.  Michelin has kindly agreed to handle this task, and will
try to get back to me tomorrow morning.  I left a message to this effect with
Vanek.
Once this has been done, I will be sending a letter to Scottsboro regarding
defense and indemnification.

I spent the last few days with Rod at a CFEE conference, and he is definitely
going to run..he doesn't think that the election will occur until June so we
will at least have him in Sacto until then.  The CFEE conference was the best
that I have ever attended, there were 10 members of the legislature there,
and though the focus was on air quality and power plants, the members were
expressing their frustation with the administration in not looking for
solutions and only pointing fingers..besides contracts and expidited siting,
a large part of the discussion was on educating the public...Senators Kuehl
and Machado are planning on putting together a public service announcement of
some sort  for members to use in their districts on how to conserve
energy..do we have anything that would be helpful?  Dion Aaroner , who chairs
the Assembly Democratic Caucus, and Rod will be doing a briefing for the
members on energy in January, do we have any basic information, like a
glossary of energy terms that I could give her, I will be with her next
Thursday.  Dion is also talking to the speaker today, briefing him on what
the govenor has been doing, and asking him to call the govenor to talk about

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Guys - Weather permitting in the Texas Panhandle area, I expect to be in
Friona, TX on Monday, November 20th, on business.  Provided below are some
items I would have mentioned in the Monday staff meeting:

Plains Farmer's Coop - To date, I have been able to collect approximately
half of the $500,000 imbalance which Plains Coop owes TW.  I will be meeting
Charles Hough in Friona (Friona is located 100 miles west of Amarillo) on
Monday to discuss the payment plan for the remaining imbalance amount in
additionaI to other general business matters.  I discussed my action plan
with legal and credit and will request full payment by January 31, 2000,
latest date.  Effective Febrary 1st,  TW will also include penalty payments
with any future imbalance outside the +/- 10% tolerance level.

Pogo Producing - I met recently with John Havard with Pogo. Pogo plans to
spud a well in Eddy county which is an offset to the EOG operated well
recently completed and in the process of being attached to TW.   Pogo's well
will be spud in December with an expected 60 day drill & completion time.
They have an optimistic expectation of the production being close to the EOG
well - current initial production of 14 MMcf/d, and have plans for additional
drilling in the field area.

CIG - A conference call was held with CIG on Friday to discuss delivery
performance issues of deliveries to the CIG/Tumbleweed point and the ability
of them to increase their delivery capacity to Transwestern.    They
explained that CIG is currently fully subscribed and operating at MAOP along
the line which provides deliveries to Transwestern, El Paso, NNG and
SPS/Nichols.  All shippers holding capacity along this line (capacity 200
MMcf/d)  already have subscribed to long term contracts primarily to El Paso
and SPS.   Currently they have no operational capability to provide any more
incremental delivery capabilities to TW at Tumbleweed.  However, they have
indicated a probable second Raton Expansion project will be announced March
2001 and have suggested that looping of this southern line could be a
possible outcome of the project which would provide incremental delivery
capacity to Transwestern above the current 40 MMcf/d level.  I will be having
additional discussions with CIG marketing individuals to determine who,
besides  El Paso and Evergreen, are the primary existing shippers down the
southern portion of CIG's system in order to potentially get them to realign
their contract to Transwestern as a primary delivery point.

Expedition of Contracting Process - Per Kevin's request, I provided him, and
also discussed, several ideas which would streamline and improve the existing
contract processing cycle.  The most important and critical recommendation
was to revise the 3 year old ET&S Discounting Policy which Bill Cordes had
established for both TW and Northern.  Obtaining approval of even a few
simple changes I could recommend to the Policy (applicable only to
Transwestern, not NNG) would have an immediate effect of simplying the
Officer approval process and would expedite the turn-around time.

Austin, TX (Dec. 4)--Attorneys for Texas Governor George W. Bush filed suit
in federal court today, seeking to prevent Santa Claus from making his list
and then checking it twice.  The complaint seeks an immediate injunction
against the beloved Christmas icon, asking the court to
effectively ban his  traditional practice of checking the list of good boys
and girls one  additional time before packing his sleigh.

The suit filed in Federal District Court in Austin, asks a federal judge to
"hereby order
Mr. Claus to cease and desist all repetitive and duplicative  list-checking
activity, and certify the original list as submitted without  amendment,
alteration, deletion, or other unnecessary modification.":   There are no
standards for deciding who is naughty, and who is nice.  It's  totally
arbitrary and capricious.  How many more time does he need to check?  This
checking, checking and re-checking over and over again must stop now,"  said
former Secretary James Baker

Baker further claimed that unnamed GOP observers witnessed an elf remove all
boys named Justin from the 'nice' list, filing them under 'naughty' instead
because "everyone knows all boys named Justin are brats."    Gov. Bush cited
the potential for unauthorized list tampering, blasted what  he called the
"crazy, crazy mess up there at the North Pole."    "Their security is really
awful, really bad," said Bush.  "My mother just  walked right in, told 'em
she was Mrs. Claus.  They didn't check her ID or  nothing."

Meanwhile, Dick Cheney, issued a direct plea to St. Nick himself.  "Mr.
Claus, I call on you to do the honorable thing, and quit checking your list.
The children of the world have had enough.  They demand closure now." Cheney
said, adding that his granddaughter has already selected a name for the pony
she's asked for.

The Rev. Jesse Jackson was quick to respond to the latest development with
plans to lead his protesters from Florida to the North Pole via dogsled. The
"Million Man Mush!" is scheduled to leave Friday.  "We need red suits and
sleighs, not law suits and delays," Jackson said.

Santa Claus could not be reached for comment, but spokeself said he was
"deeply distressed" by news of the pending legal action against him. "He's
losing weight, and he hasn't said 'Ho Ho Ho' for days," said the spokeself.
"He's just not feeling jolly."

Dear Santa:

Listen you fat little troll, I've been  helping you out every year, playing
at
being the perfect Christmas present,  wearing skimpy bathing suits in frigid
weather, and drowning in fake tea  from one too many tea parties, and I hate
to break it to ya Santa, but IT'S  DEFINITELY PAYBACK TIME! There had better
be some changes around here this  Christmas, or I'm gonna call for a
nationwide meltdown (and trust me, you  won't wanna be around to smell it).

So, here's my holiday wish list,  Santa:

1. A nice, comfy pair of sweat pants and a frumpy, oversized  sweatshirt. I'm
sick of looking like a hooker. How much smaller are these  bathing suits
gonna
get? Do you have any idea what it feels like to have  nylon and Velcro
crawling up your butt?

2. Real underwear that can  be pulled on and off. Preferably white. What
bonehead at Mattel decided to  cheap out and MOLD imitation underwear to my
skin? (It looks like  cellulite).

3. A REAL man... maybe GI Joe. Hell, I'd take Tickle-Me Elmo  over that
wimped-out excuse for a boyfriend Ken. And what's with that  earring anyway?
If I'm gonna have to suffer with him, at least make him and  me anatomically
correct.

4. Arms that actually bend so I can push  the aforementioned Ken-wimp away
once he is anatomically correct.

5.  Breast reduction surgery. I don't care whose arm you have to twist, just
get  it done.

6. A sports bra. To wear until I get the surgery.

7. A  new career. Pet doctor and school teacher just don't cut it. How about
a
systems analyst? Or better yet, an advertising account executive.

8.  A new, more '90s persona. Maybe "PMS Barbie," complete with a miniature
container of chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream and a bag of chips;
"Animal Rights Barbie," with my very own paint gun, outfitted with a fake
fur
coat and handcuffs; or "Stop Smoking Barbie," sporting a removable  Nicotrol
patch and equipped with several packs of gum.

9. No more  McDonald's endorsements. The grease is wrecking my vinyl.

10. Mattel  stock options. It's been 37 years, I think I deserve it.

OK, Santa,  that's it. Considering my valuable contribution to society, I
don't think  these requests are out of line. If you disagree, then you can
find yourself  a new bimbo doll for next Christmas. It's that simple.

Yours truly,

Barbie

Britt
Please find below the answers to your queries re the AES shipment. Please do
not hesitate to contact Harry or I if you need further information. David
Minns (our in-house counsel) is actually on vacation until 2nd January 2001
and is not on email during this time. You may also be interested to know that
we understand Glencore (a fellow Australian coal trading company) has
received a similar subpoena re trading with AES during this period.
Enron Coal Asia Pacific Pty Ltd (ECAP) was the counterparty to this deal.
ECAP sold to AES approx 60 000 metric tonnes of coal +/-10% as per the
contract signed 7th September. (The effective date of the agreement was 10
August 2000). The actually delivery amount was 54 152.35 metric tonnes a the
cargo was loaded 3rd October 2000. ECAP is incorporated in Australia.
The deal was negotiated by our Harry Papadopoulos and the contract signed
here in Sydney by myself, Heidi Mason under delegated authority from  Stuart
Staley. (My delegated authority is based on Stu's prior approval which in
this case was received via email on 6th September 2000)
We have a copy of the contract here in Sydney, but as the coal was bought
under LC and such LC was issued out of London, all shipping   documentation
for this load was forwarded to London to the attention of Claire Veijou and
Cornelia Luptowitsch. London office also issued the invoice  to AES on behalf
of ECAP and this was done by Rebecca Millerchip or Maya Beyhem.
Also, for your information, Harrry has prior travel plans that put him in
China on the date of the hearing. While these could be changed, it would be
less than desirable. Will it be necessary for the trader to be the Enron rep
who appears on behalf of the company or could it ideally be someone from
Houston (or London if needs be) simply because this is a long way to go for
one appearance. John Bowman has resigned from Enron since the time this deal
was done and therefore we have not advised him of this action.
With thanks

Goal Line Isolation




DESCRIPTION

Line up in a Trips Right formation.  Have inside receiver run a five
yardpost, drawing coverage from the middle zone defender.  The middle
receiver will run an eight yard curl.  The outside receiver will run a
delayed slant.  Most of the coverage should be moving left.  The running back
will delay, then run up the middle to the back of the end zone, then dart to
the right, the QB will delay and sprint right also. The defense will be
moving left and should be a step behind.  If the QB can sprint to the end
zone, a lane may be open, or else the RB should be open.

QB : The quarterback should initally delay for a split second before
sprinting to his right. quarterback can make a good head fake to the left or
look at his receivers on the left before . He should run the ball into the
end zone if it is open or throw the ball to his running . The quarterback
should run the ball if the defense is out of , even if the running back is
open. This will eliminate the chance of a incomplete pass or .

RB : The running back should initially delay for a split second to give a
block for the quarterback. This will allow the play to develop and keep the
defense from worrying about the RB. The RB then runs forward to the back of
the end zone and makes a sharp cut to the right before going out of bounds.
Make sure the running back stays around the back of the end zone so the
quarterback can throw the ball over the defenders head if need be.

Other Players : The other players should do their best to draw the defense
towards the left side of the field.

==================================

Center Hook and Ladder


DESCRIPTION

Line up with twins to the left; one blocker on the left of center; one WR on
the right and a RB to the left of QB

RB: go in short motion to the left; make a loop patern on outside of the
"twins" who should block for him. The RB is secondary receiver.

Right WR: Do a 5-yard button hook to inside.

QB: Throw to right WR.

Right WR: Lateral ball to the center who after the snap should be moving
parallel to line of scrimmage, about 2-3 yards down field.

Center: Receive lateral and run option with QB who should stay in
pitch-relationship after he throws the ball.

QB: If the hook isn't open, hit the RB or run for it.

Left Guard: Block


QB : The quarterback needs to first read the defense. If the right receiver
can beat the coverage then look the defenders off and deliver a good quick
pass to the receiver. The receiver should be able to use his body to shield
the defender. If the defense is in good position to stop the pass call an
audible or be prepared to throw the ball to your secondary receiver (RB). As
soon as the quarterback throws the ball he needs to immediately get into
position to receive the pitch from his center. The quarterback will most
likely have to be running full speed right after he throws the ball so he can
be in a good pitch relation with his center. Make sure the quarterback never
stops running with the center.

Right WR: The right receiver needs to run full speed off the line of
scrimmage to push his defender back. As soon as he gets about 5-yards down
the field he should curl in towards the quarterback and use his body to
shield the defender. Make sure the receiver knows to knock the ball down if
the quarterback makes a bad pass. As soon as the receiver catches the ball he
should immediately pitch the ball to his center. Don't be in too big of a
hurry. If the pitch isn't there the receiver should turn the ball up field
for as many yards as possible or try to get the pitch to his quarterback.
Don't pitch the ball to the other team.

Center: The center will run 2-3 yards forward then drag the line of scrimmage
left to right. The center should be running at a medium speed until the
receiver catches the ball. This will allow the receiver to get a good handle
on the ball before pitching it. The center should be on the inside of the
receiver and must be prepared to give a quick pitch to the quarterback. If
there is a defender between the center and the quarterback, the center should
fake the pitch and continue up field.

Other Players : The other players need to follow the routes on the play
diagram so they force the defenders to the opposite side of the field. The RB
should always be ready for the pass. He is the secondary receiver and needs
to be able to bail the quarterback out of trouble.

Caution : This play requires practice and flawless execution. Timing is
Crucial.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Tipper Gore, an amateur genealogical researcher, discovered
that her husband's great-great uncle, Gunther Gore, a fellow
lacking in character, was hanged for horse stealing and train
robbery in Tennessee in 1889.

The only known photograph of Gunther shows him standing
on the gallows. On the back of the picture is this inscription:
"Gunther Gore; horse thief, sent to Tennessee Prison 1885,
escaped 1887, robbed the Tennessee Flyer six times. Caught
by Pinkerton detectives, convicted and hanged in 1889."

After letting Al Gore and his staff of professional image
consultants peruse the findings, they decided to crop Gunther's
picture, scan it in as an enlarged image, and edited it with
image processing software so that all that's seen is a head shot.

The accompanying biographical sketch was sent to the
Associated Press as follows:

"Gunther Gore was a famous
rancher in early Tennessee history. His business empire
grew to include acquisition of valuable equestrian assets
and intimate dealings with the Tennessee railroad.
Beginning in 1883, he devoted several years of his life to
service at a government facility, finally taking leave to resume
his dealings with the railroad. In 1887, he was a key player in
a vital investigation run by the renowned Pinkerton Detective
Agency. In 1889, Gunther passed away during an important
civic function held in his honor when the platform upon which
he was standing, collapsed."

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Steve Smith and I spoke today.

1.  He stressed repeatedly that the agreement re a schedule is an amendment
to the contract, therefore is "contractual" and binding on the parties; and
that we must have a schedule that will allow the arbs to make their award by
April 16.  I told him we had no opposition to moving quickly, especially if
the arbs agreed with us as to their extremely limited authority and
jurisdiction, which was even more contractual.  That said, said I, the arbs
will set the schedule, not us.  How does Smith propose to enforce Duke's
"right" to an award by April 16?  No response other than to repeat himself.

2.  He said he thought this was largely a case to be decided by expert
testimony.  I said it seemed just the opposite: do they have a "the cap is
not a cap" expert and a "making a profit can still be an economic hardship"
expert?  No answer.

3.  He wanted to agree on a date for swapping witness statements, expert
reports, etc.  He said he wanted to be able to give the arbs an agreed
schedule by the time we have our first call.  I told him there was no way we
could do that, because until the arbs resolved the dispute over the scope of
the proceeding, I had no way of knowing what kind of discovery I would need.
He said he saw my point.

4.  He plainly hopes to present evidence by witness statement rather than
just depos or live testimony.  I told him we would want to depose most
witnesses from whom he planned to offer a statement.  That said, I said I
saw no problem with witness statements (thinking that this may be the
easiest way to get testimony from Rebecca McDonald, among others).

5.  He asked me if we would agree to have the hearing in San Francisco.  I
told him I thought the contract specified Houston.  He said that it
specified Houston for "the arbitration," but that it didn't say the
"hearing" had to be here.  I told him that sounded like an argument by a
company that says a cap is not a cap.  He did not laugh.  I then tried a
different approach:  I told him it sounded like the agreement to arbitrate
in Houston was "contractual."

6.  He told me he envisioned the hearing lasting 1 or 2 days.  I told him
that I thought that was right if the issues were (a) is the cap a cap, and
(b) is the cap an economic hardship.

7.  He returned to topic #1 and implored me to move things ahead quickly.  I
told him that, to my knowledge, we had not been asked by Morris for an
initial conference, but that we were ready, willing and able to have one
whenever asked.

8.  I did NOT ask him whether Duke had let all of the California utilities
it has been fleecing get out of their contracts with Duke because they posed
some sort of economic hardship....

9.  I did learn some interesting trivia about him:  he has triplet 4 year
old sons.  Maybe that's why he always sounds so worn out.

GOP MOVES NATURAL GAS TO FRONT BURNER
Assembly Republicans join together once again to request Davis to call
special session.
(SACRAMENTO) ) Assembly Republicans united Monday in asking Governor Gray
Davis to call a special session of the California legislature to deal with
skyrocketing natural gas prices.
&Families and businesses are reeling every month from extraordinary gas
prices.  Pardon the expression, but the natural gas crisis no longer belongs
on California,s back burner,8 said Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell
(R ) Villa Park).
Assembly Republicans unanimously signed a letter to Governor Gray Davis
asking for him to convene a special session of the legislature to deal with
California,s skyrocketing natural gas bills.  Republicans delivered the
letter to Davis this morning.
&A special session is both a symbolic and a practical necessity.  It tells
Californians that we care about their skyrocketing gas bills.  It tells
businesses everywhere that California is going to provide for its future
energy needs,8 said Campbell.  &Practically speaking, a special session also
allow us to pass legislation which can take effect immediately.8
Republicans believe the electricity and natural gas crises are inextricably
linked.
&California,s natural gas crisis is completely intertwined with its
electricity crisis,8 said Campbell.  &Any plan to deal with our electricity
crisis must have a natural gas component or Californians are going to pay
unacceptably high prices for both.8
Assembly Republicans believe the natural gas crisis has many fronts, all of
which could be addressed comprehensively by a special session.
&Natural gas issues include pipeline capacity, storage, exploration,
alternative fuels and conservation,8 said Campbell.  &A special session lets
us put together a comprehensive solution.8
&The private sector has the expertise and the capital to deal with these
issues if government would just get out of the way.  Republicans believe that
a legislative solution to the natural gas crisis should leave the resources
and primary decision-making to the private sector,8 said Campbell.

I received the proposed contract for both compensation credits and fees for
EOTT and it's contractors to be put on Kern Water Banks Master Permit.
Compensation credit will cost $62,000.00 with an additional $16,000.00 to add
EOTT to the Master Permit so we are covered for incidental take at NCL. In
order for the pipeline project to get started the following things must
happen.
1. Give the Kern Water Bank a check for $78,000.00. A contractor constructing
a water line adjacent to EOTT's ROW has cleared the habitat. This should
reduce EOTT's disturbance acreage by a small amount, I suggest we go ahead an
purchase the 24 acres so we can get started, if we have any credits left we
can use them on the removal of the existing Rogas pipeline.
2. We need to make a decision on weather we are going to purchase 15.3 acres
of compensation credit from Area for NCL or try to use the existing credits
we received with the purchase of the plant. I have tried to get in contact
with Jeff Single at the Fish and Game to set up a meeting to work out details
of managing the existing credits but have not been able to speak with him. I
believe the process to enable us to use credits we already own will not be
accomplished in time to use on this project. Scott Jones is working with Mark
Poe at Area on what compensation credits from Area will cost. He originally
was quoted $1,850.00 an acre to Area, $400.00 an acre endowment fee to the
Fish and Game and $100.00 an acre for fencing to the Fish and Game. Scott
talked with Gary Fuller and was informed that Mark had previously quoted
$1500.00 an acre to Area. Scott asked Mark about the lower price, he is
checking into it and will get back to Scott. Once we purchase the
compensation credits from Area, Mark will need to notify Cheryl Harding at
KWB and then she will sell EOTT the KWB compensation credits and add EOTT to
the Master Permit. Since the Fish and Wildlife project approval letter stated
she was to be notified of the purchase of credits form Area a letter of
credit will not be acceptable. We also need to provide the letter of approval
for the project from the Fish and Game to Mark Poe. It is my understanding we
have only received verbal approval and have not gotten a hard copy. Randi
McCormick is going to get the letter.
3. We need to provide insurance certificates to West Kern Water as stated in
the encroachment permit before start of construction. Josie Castrejana is
going to provide those.
4. We still do not have the permits for the road bores at State Hwy-43 and
Interstate-5. The state has the permits ready but they want proof we have ROW
with the land owners on either side of the highways. As soon as KWB gives
back the signed recorded agreements I will provide that to Caltrans and then
they will issue the permits. The other missing permit is for the crossing of
the Kern River by-pass channel. Larry is working on that permit, we should
have the permit by the time we reach the channel with the pipelines.

First, as a "heads-up" the DPCA is somewhat in disarray after terminating the
Executive Director and resignation of the Chairman and several members (most
of it caused by retaining an attorney for the California DG proceeding
without getting authorization from the members and then scrambling to figure
out how to pay for it).  Therefore, before working with Peter Chamberlain
make sure that the DPCA is funding him from dues and not an assessment that
we might end up having to pay for (I think Peter may not be retained by DPCA
since the DPCA is restructuring including looking at substantial increase in
dues).  Just be very clear who is paying for Peter and understand our
financial liability before you commence any effort with him (I could be wrong
but I'd rather err on the side of conservancy).
I would be happy to take a look at what AEP/APS are proposing as long as
there's no immediate time frame.  Also, I'm not sure what you mean about
earlier versions of P1547 having sections deleted.  Please clarify.  Thanks.

If you were wondering why Hebert, speaking at the meeting  said that he would
certainly be viewed as a Grinch, here is a transcript of a poem read on NPR
last week.  It is meant to be read with the same timing as Dr. Suess's
Grinch.  Thanks to Leslie Comnes (a California ratepayer whom I hold in high
regard) for transcribing:
The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
Love the Christmas light season, the lights are first rate.
They glitter, they sparkle all red, white, and blue-ish,
They impress even Whos who are ACLUish.
They dazzle the neighborhoods hour by hour,
'til someone says, "Shut them off! We're out of power."
Just who is the source of this Christmas light pinch?
Does the great Golden State have its very own Grinch?
Does the smog belching, grease guzzling junk TV creep
Take lights out of Christmas, so children will weep?
We'll catch and declaw him, it sounds rather simple,
Yet much more complex than a Florida dimple.
We'll trap him by leaving a late evening snack out,
Not that he'll see it at night in a blackout.
The Whos grasp at straws, "There's one man who can save us,"
And they hang their Who hopes on their governor, Davis.
"He'll light the state tree, and he'll keep it ablaze,
and the white fir will glow for the next 30 days!"
The Gov lights the tree, and he says with a scoff,
"30 days? 30 minutes! Now turn that thing off!"
But Davis a Grinch? That would be quite a climb,
His gig's raising money, it takes all his time.
"Who, then?" demand all the Whos and Who's Whos.
"Who cut the juice? Tell us now, we need clues!"
Well, now some blame the cold in the arctic Northwest,
But others say that power plants close for a rest.
Some say it's FERC, yet don't know what FERC means,
But they think that some FERC jerk messed with power machines.
Some blame El Nino, and some cite Cal-ISO [?],
But no one will rule out H. Ross Perot.
The blackouts are rolling out Stage 1, 2, and 3.
They're saying, "Cut power, de-sparkle your tree!"
Men walk on the moon and invent penicillin,
So wouldn't you think they could find us a villain?
The Whos and Who's Whos in the great Golden State
See Christmas light evenings start two hours late.
Is it too much to ask, just one culprit to lynch?
It's just so unfair that we can't find a Grinch!

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I spoke with Ralph Komai, PCB person with SoCal, concerning the SWG meeting
about PBCs on the SWG system.  As mentioned in the last note, SWG has
discovered PCBs and has been sampling to determine extent and movement into
their system.  SWG receives gas from SoCal and PGE at two separate and
independent interconnects.  Liquids have been collected at the two
interconnects from SoCal at concentrations of <500 and <100 ppm,
respectively.  They have taken approx. 100 wipe samples and have had "hits"
but nothing over 100 ug per wipe.

In the meeting, SWG has expressed aggressive interest to SoCal about the
installation of filter separators at the SoCal/SWG interconnects.  They felt
that the installation of separators would greatly benefit the reduction of
PCBs into their system.  Becasue of this, Ralph stated that SWG would be
sending him a proposal for the installation of separators at the two
interconnect locations.  I gave Ralph Earl Chanleys phone number as he was
involved in the separator construction project last summer with PG&E.

I've deferred the negotiation with Mark Knippa given my need for some
information from James and Kevin on our ability to avoid peak usage, etc.
Steve Harris and I talked this morning about settlement authority and our
going in position, obviously, is that ECS should pick up the whole $300+ K.
I expect that Knippa will angle toward a split the difference approach and
then try to put his share of the value on some future deal.  To counter
that,  I think I'll need to hit him pretty firmly on the "relationship
issue."  I.e., he's got to fix this problem or his chance of doing more deals
with the pipeline group will be seriously hurt.  That should be a big deal to
him and may get us the resolution we need.  To push that I need three things
from you:
1.  Rod, have we already communicated to ECS, or at a higher level like
Redmond, that we won't do any more deals with them?  Obviously if we have
already told them we're done working with them, my threat won't carry much
weight.
2.  Are you all OK with the threat?  I suspect that our threat to quit doing
business with them will go immediately up their chain of command and that
Redmond or someone will call Stan to complain.
3.  Can we agree conceptually to do future deals if Knippa needs a bucket to
put our dollars in?  He may propose something specific and I'd like to be
able to agree that we will "work with them" on future deals.

Thanks.  DF

The PX confirmed receipt of EPMI's Notice of Termination as of 1:30 pm PST
today.  Afterwards, we tried to establish the time that the PX declared that
PG&E and Edison were in default so that we could, if necessary at a later
time, show that EPMI had terminated before that default.  Unfortunately, the
PX would not come out and say that a default had occurred, and as the day
wound down, employees at the PX became more and more taciturn.  Brett made
all of his calls on recorded lines, but I asked him to summarize the
conversations in writing.  I thought everyone would be interested in seeing
this.

Good work, Brett.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


This email is a follow-up to yesterday's lobbyist conference call and
today's meeting re potential language changes on 60x.  Attached are two sets
of draft amendment language that were discussed today consistent with a
general strategy on the bill that was discussed yesterday.  That strategy,
generally speaking, keys off an expected Calpine meeting with Hertzberg on
Monday, and is as outlined again below.  Comments / concerns with language
and/or general strategy should go to Julee for IEP by Monday COB for
consideration in next steps as mentioned in the action items.
The anticipated approach with the Hertzberg will be:
A) Persuade him that the "California First!" notion as presented in this
bill (and elsewhere) is not a good policy approach and that the bill should
be killed because: it will be interpreted as protectionist by other states
and will lead them to retailiate; it will isolate California from existing
supplies elsewhere that could help serve California loads; it could deny CA
access to new generation built in other states that could help CA; it will
slow CA projects "in the pipeline"; it will undermine existing commercial
arrangements that developers have _with_ California entities from CA
projects in the pipeline, etc.
If this does not happen, then ...
B) Persuade him to change the bill into something else (as in
carrot/incentive and not a stick that increases commercial and development
risks);
if this does not work and he will consider alternate language which does not
disrupt existing arrangements, then ...
C1) Take the more extensive "bulletproof" language, attached as "C1", which
protects any existing commercial arrangements and provides a method to bring
buyers and sellers together via a notice to interested purchasers maintained
by the CEC;
if that does not work and he will consider alternate language on another
approach which will not disrupt existing arrangements, then ...
C2) Take the "offer to negotiate" language, attached as version "C2", which
was the language developed and circulated yesterday (with the addition of
irrigation districts to the list of folks to whom the offer to negotiate is
extended),
and if that doesn't work, then
D) he wants to disrupt existing commercial relationships and he wants to
adopt a protectionist "California First!" policy which we cannot fix or
support.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


From an operational perspective, during a Stage 3 Emergencies, the ISO has
three options available to keep the lights on.   It can (1) buy more power
(under its DOE granted Section 202(c) authority), (2) cut scheduled power
transactions, or (3) derate transmission capacity used to export power from
its system.  The Cal ISO has recently been derating to zero transmission
capacity to the Northwest (option 3).  Because transmission users can't get
capacity to sell their power outside California, the effect is that the ISO
gets cheaper power over customers in the NW.

I was thinking of a political approach to solving this problem.  I was
wondering if you could work with your contacts to mobilize NW Senators (?) to
write a letter to the California ISO and the Governor; you might even get
Steve Wright to sign on given that this  situation must make it more
difficult for him to balance his budget.

The central theme of the letter would point out what a hue and cry there
would be if BPA engaged in such actions and that California is simply  trying
to get cheaper power than the rest of the region.  It could also point out
that the Cal ISO already has the mechanism of the Secretary of Energy's
Section 202(c) orders to get the power it needs for an emergency and that
this order is fairer because it allows market participants to have a just and
reasonable rate determined (albeit after the fact) for the power.  I wouldn't
bring up the ISO's authority to cut scheduled power transactions.  I don't
think we want to encourage that.

What do you think?  Call me.

then last night after dinner he confessed that his office computer was

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I wanted to let everyone know that the meeting between Southwest Gas and
SoCal concerning presence of PCBs on the Southwest Gas system will be this
tuesday.  I had an opportunity to speak with Ralph Komai today during the PCB
quarterly management conference call  that Transwestern has with SoCal to
discuss PCB related invoices.  As a brief summary, Southwest has had isolated
hits of PCB in liquids (232 and 132 ppm) and in wipe tests (10-100 ug/wipe)
in regulators on their system and they have asked Ralph if he would assist
them in the management and disposal of PCBs on their system.  He wil also be
providing thoughts on how and why PCBs move in a gas pipeline.

I had asked Ralph not to mention about Transwestern's agreement with SoCal
for which Transwestern pays SoCal for 86% of their PCB costs.  I had asked
him to only focus on the Southwest system.  Apparently Southwest is not up to
speed with the PCB regualtions, however, enough so that they do realize that
the mega rule will impact their operations and Ralph will probably provide
input for that as well from an LDC standpoint.

I asked Ralph whether Southwest seemed excited or worried about the PCB
discovery on their system and he indicated that they were more concerned
about compliance with the PCB regulations.  Ralph said he will let me know
the results of the meeting.

Notes from subject mtg.  Steve Stein - please schedule something where we can
get together and I can hand this off to you.  Need your involvement.

0)  Prior to the meeting - I had called Ben to let him know of my
transitioning to EES and that I wouldn't be there - he requested that I
come.  Keith Dodson reviewed and requested that I attend and xtion w/ Steve
Stein.  Steve Stein was to come to meeting, but didn't show.  Steve has been
requested to take charge by Keith Dodson.
1) Kay Mann, Ben Jacoby, Chris Booth, Ron Tapscott, and myself were present
at the subject meeting.
2)  Noone from EAS came except for me.  I called and Rigby came late.
3)  Discussed situation - Calpine evidently bought the Nov01 Westinghouse
Machine from Westinghouse, ending Calpine's interest in our "wet" 501D5A.
4)  Everyone agreed that Westinghouse wasn't "focussed" on resolving this.
Kay reminded the group that prior to litigating the contract called for a
"high level Mgmt meeting".  Everyone seemed to agree that it was time to call
such a meeting.
5)  Rigby to draft a rebutal letter to the 15 Feb Westinghouse letter (where
they again inferred that they had delivered the Generator, and if we wanted
the new one....., we needed to provide a purchase order).  In that letter,
Rigby will confirm that a)  we don't believe the machine was ever delivered,
b)  we have been delayed/impeded, and c)  LD's to the tune of approx $4MM are
due, and c)  we request the "high level mgmt meeting" prior to initiating
litigation.
6)  Letter will go out with Dan Shultz's signature - need highest level just
below Keith Dodson.  Since Dan had been involved...., the team chose him.  We
might consider putting the letter out under Steve Stein's name.  The letter
will also request that all future correspondance be addressed to John Rigby
(this was Ben Jacoby's request).
7)  Ben requested that if Dan Shultz gets any documents or calls......, that
he refer them to John Rigby.
8)  Kay to edit letter and get out the door Fri 23 Feb.
9)  Rigby working w/ Jim Boullion to expedite insurance
inspection/verification of coverage.  Bouillion will keep Rigby appraised.
Inspection needed ASAP to confirm Generator is "totalled".  Evidently, the
crate has now been opened, but....., our insurance inspector hasn't come
yet.
10)  Rigby to send email to Ben Jacoby's team every two days, detailing
progress/req'ed action.  The entire team is disappointed in the combined lack
of effectiviness of the "team" in getting this issue handled/resolved.
11)  Ben requested that EAS have their best resouce available to inspect the
generator with the insurance inspector - the team believes this should be Jim
Sutherland or his designee/equivalent.  Chris Booth to acompany also.
12)  Kay Mann confirmed that she had discussed the situation with the ENA
origination team that was "... on the ground..." at VEPCO...., and they
thought it was funny that anyone would think that the slipped Generator
delivery date didn't "delay or impede" our efforts to close that deal.  Also,
Kay reminded us that there was no tie between a specific project, and the
"delay/impede".
13)  At the high level Westinghouse meeting - who will be the senior Enron
rep?  Kevin Presto was discussed by Kay/Ben.  I discussed Steve Stein.  To be
discussed further.  At that high level meeting....., we need to insure that
Westinghouse sees that Enron really was "delayed/impeded" .  Until they
believe our claim for LD's has merit - they probably won't attempt to
compromise on a settlement.  Westinghouse has offered to give us our money
back (not confirmed, but Mark has offered to run that up the flagpole).  Ben
has requested approx $4MM more to cover IDC.  Westinghouse has said.... "no
way".  So...., we have approx a $4MM dispute.  Westinghouse doesn't believe
we have been delayed or impeded - they are not aware that we were in fact
impeded on Electrocities, nor are they aware of the broad interpretation of
delay/impede that would require them to pay LD's.  The team believes
Westinghouse is acting like they "delivered" the generator (in June 00), so
they can "act" like there should be even another reason that they don't owe
LD's.  The team believes that Siemen's position on "delivery" will change
once they debate that with a Rigby, Schwartzenburg, or a Kay Mann

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Here are possible Q's.  Dan W. will prepare first cut at answers.

Questions for January 31 Hearing

Price Gouging
On January 22, your company reported fourth-quarter results for
2000, in which you showed that profits from your energy trading unit rose
256 percent and your overall earnings rose 34 percent.  How much of this was
attributable to increased sales in California?  How much did you make from
sales in California?
What is the highest per kilowatt-hour price Enron charged on the
spot market?  What is the cost of production for that power?
In a recent Houston Chronicle article (January 23, 2001), Mr.
Skilling, your CEO was quoted as saying that not only had the California
situation not had an impact on earnings, but that "it may even turn out to
be a benefit in the long run."  Can you please explain the long-term
benefits you expect?
In a recent New York Times column by Paul Krugman, Ken Lay was
quoted as saying that California consumers "need to see the price signals
that is, pay much more and start modifying behavior to reduce demand until
we get more supplies."  What did Mr. Lay mean by this?  With the tremendous
profits that Enron is making in this situation, isn't it pretty brazen for
him to be suggesting that California consumers should pay more for their
power?

Market Manipulation
A number of generators and wholesalers, including Enron, have been
accused of withholding energy to drive up energy prices in the Western
states.  I understand that you are being sued in state court in San
Francisco for such activities and an independent monitor has supported these
allegations.  Does Enron currently have any generation assets off-line for
maintenance?  Did Enron make all of its generated power in the Western
states available for purchase by California utilities?  If not, why did it
withhold power?  How much did you withhold or sell in other states despite
knowing of the crisis in California?
At the time that the spot market collapsed and two of California's
largest utilities were teetering on the verge of bankruptcy, what price was
Enron asking for its power on the spot market?  What was Enron's cost of
producing that power?  How much profit did you make in December from sales
in California?
Did Enron ever refuse to sell power to a California utility because
of concerns about their credit worthiness?  Did your company ever tell
California utilities that it would not sell power to them because of credit
concerns?
Do you believe that Enron has any responsibility as a corporation in
a crisis such as occurred in California?  How do you justify making such
large profits, driving the utilities into bankruptcy and then refusing to
sell power to those same utilities because of their credit worthiness?

Utility Forbearance & Auction
California clearly has a significant problem with the potential
bankruptcy of two of its largest utilities.  How much money do those
utilities owe your company?  Has your company offered any payment
forbearance or forgiveness in light of the excessive prices that you were
charging them on the spot market for power?
California held an Internet auction last week for long-term
contracts for sale of power to the state.  Did Enron participate in the
auction?  What price did you offer for power in non-peak times?  What price
did you bid for power during peaking periods?
Your company has successfully gouged the utilities in California for
power on the spot market because long-term contracts were discouraged.  Now,
you are looking to enter into long-term contracts, which many experts
believe will be at rates far above the market in the future.  You really are
going to profit coming and going.  How can you claim that you are not price
gouging in this case?
In the past, you have offered power to California utilities in
long-term contracts at rates less than $.06 per kilowatt-hour.  How do you
justify previously offering power at much lower rates and now saying that
you are unable to provide it for less than a much higher price?

Role in California Deregulation
Your company was supportive of the California deregulation efforts
and has been a leading supporter of deregulation nationwide.  In light of
the "colossal failure" of the effort in California, do you still support
deregulation in other states or at the federal level?  What safeguards would
you support to protect against increased rates for consumers?

The Future
California is likely to enact a legislative fix to address this
problem.  What do you think will happen this summer during peak demand
periods?  Is there another crisis in the making in California or in other
states such as New York?

Political Contributions & Activities
Your company has been very active politically and according to press
reports, Mr. Lay is very close to President Bush.  Wasn't your company one
of the biggest donors to the Bush Campaign and the Inaugural Committee?  How
much money did your company contribute in soft money to the Bush Campaign
and the RNC?  How much money did your executives give in personal money to
the Bush Campaign and the RNC?  How much to the inaugural?
Has anyone from Enron participated in the Bush transition teams or
the so-called "advisory committees?"
What information and suggestions has your company or its officials
provided to the transition team or the new Administration regarding energy
deregulation or the California situation?
What discussions have officials from your company had with
Administration or Transition officials about the California situation?


Softball Questions

In the short term and then in the long term, what can California do
to fix its power supply system?
What do you believe are the flaws in the current California system?
The Power Exchange?  The Independent System Operator?
Why did deregulation fail in California?
Some people, including Governor Davis, have suggested that
out-of-state power suppliers, such as Enron, are to blame for this crisis,
is that true?
Some people in California have suggested that the State should take
over the power system.  Please comment on this proposal.  Is this a good
idea?
In which states has deregulation worked?  How do you explain the
success in those states in contrast with the failures in California?
This Committee will likely consider deregulation legislation at some
point in the future.  Should we undertake this effort?

Bush Expected To Act Soon To Fill FCC Chair; Transition Team Discusses Agency
Changes

With most of his decisions regarding top cabinet-level positions out of the
way, President Bush is expected to begin shifting his attention to selecting
lower-level political appointees, including the FCC chairman and the
administrator of the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA).

Late last week speculation was rife that a decision on the FCC top spot was
imminent, with a handful of insiders even predicting that a new chairman
could be appointed over the inaugural weekend or at the beginning of this
week.

One factor that several GOP insiders say could spur quick action from the
White House is the prospect of having Democratic Commissioner Susan Ness
assume the chairman's duties.  As the most senior Commissioner at the FCC,
Ms. Ness would slide into that role absent an interim appointment by the
president, notes one longtime FCC observer.  "And that just doesn't sit too
well with a Republican administration," the source said.

Most Washington insiders expect Commissioner Michael K. Powell to be named
interim chairman, as no Senate confirmation is needed for a sitting
Commissioner to assume that post.  "Mr. Powell is viewed by many as someone
who can get the FCC up and running without a learning curve," an industry
source told TR.

But the question of who gets the permanent FCC job has been the topic du jour
for most telecom industry watchers.  Sources say Texas Public Utility
Commission Chairman Patrick H. Wood III has been positioning himself for that
role, but Mr. Powell also is considered a front-runner for the position if he
wants it.

Under one scenario floated by a GOP insider, President Bush would name Mr.
Powell interim chairman and then, later on, nominate Mr. Wood as permanent
chairman and a new Democrat to replace Ms. Ness.  Ms. Ness' term expired in
June 1999; she currently is serving under a recess appointment that
then-President Clinton made late last month (TR, Dec. 25, 2000).  She may
continue in her position until a replacement is nominated by President Bush
and confirmed by the Senate, or until the end of the current congressional
session.

L. Ari Fleischer, a Bush transition team spokesman who was slated to become
White House spokesman after the inauguration, gave few clues during a Jan. 19
press briefing about where the incoming administration stood on naming new
agency heads.  Asked by TR whether a timetable had been developed for
appointing a new FCC chairman, Mr. Fleischer replied,  "That will happen in
due order as those announcements are ready."

A spokesman at the Commerce Department's NTIA said former Administrator
Gregory L. Rohde hadn't made any decisions about his future plans.  As a
political appointee under former President Clinton, Mr. Rohde stepped down
from his post last Friday.

"The wireless community wanted him to stay on at NTIA to help oversee the `
3G' [third generation] initiative, but so far there's been no indication"
that President Bush plans to renominate Mr. Rohde to be NTIA administrator,
the NTIA spokesman told TR.

Mentioned as possible candidates to succeed Mr. Rohde at NTIA are Earl
Comstock, a partner at the Washington law firm of Sher & Blackwell and a
former aide to Sen. Ted Stevens (R., Alaska); James Derderian, former House
Commerce Committee staff director and a member of the NTIA transition team;
and Kevin Martin, who oversaw communications policy issues for the Bush
transition team.

FCC Transition Team Gathers

A Jan. 17 meeting of the Bush administration's FCC transition team may have
failed to produce a name and a timetable for replacing Mr. Kennard.  But
numerous industry participants described the meeting as a productive first
step in smoothing out some of the rough edges at the FCC-particularly the
pace at which the Commission makes decisions and its role in reviewing
mergers.

Participating in the Jan. 17 meeting, sources say, were nearly all of the FCC
"transition advisory team" members (TR, Jan. 15) and officials from the Bush
administration's "in-house" transition team:  Mr. Martin; former Rep. Bill
Paxon (R., N.Y.), who is chairman of the transition advisory committee; and
Rebecca Armendariz, project director-FCC transition team.

Speaking briefly with TR last week, Ms. Armendariz described the meeting as "
good" and "productive" and said it was the "first and last" time that the FCC
advisory team would meet with Bush transition officials.  Ms. Armendariz also
reported that the FCC advisory team had grown to a total of about 42 members,
which is "six to eight" more than was posted on the Bush-Cheney transition
Web site (http://www.bushcheneytransition.com) as of Jan. 19.

An advisory team member who didn't want to be identified said the meeting
lasted about one and a half hours and mostly focused on changes in general
FCC procedures.  "There wasn't much time for a lengthy discussion on specific
points, and they didn't mention any names" of potential chairman nominees,
the source said.  "But there was a sense that things need to be speeded up at
the FCC, and [that] there ought to be less FCC involvement in the
merger-review context," the source reported.

Meanwhile, documents circulated among the FCC advisory team members show the
Bush transition team sought feedback from the advisers on the following six
subjects:  (1) the top five issues facing the FCC; (2) what rules and/or
policies are in most need of reform; (3) what management, administrative or
procedural issues need to be addressed; (4) what can be done to expedite the
FCC's decision-making process; (5) what significant challenges will the new
administration and FCC face with respect to Congress, public perceptions, or
the press; and (6) what organizational changes should be considered early in
the new administration.

Participants in last week's meeting were given a chance to go over papers
containing their FCC "wish lists," sources report, and the Bush transition
team "seemed to be interested and listening."  Still, one source described
the meeting as "light on substance" and doubted whether "anyone had even read
our paper yet."

Jay Kitchen, an FCC advisory team member and president and chief executive
officer of the Personal Communications Industry Association, told TR he was
encouraged that finding more spectrum for third-generation (3G) technology "
was near the top of everybody's list."

PCIA's paper to the Bush team stressed the need to "speed up the tower-siting
process" and ensure that wireless carriers "receive all the interconnection
rights they are due under" the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Mr. Kitchen
said.

Progress & Freedom Foundation fellow Randolph J. May, also a member of the
FCC advisory team, called the Jan. 17 meeting "productive" and said it gave
the Bush transition team a "good chance to offer their views on what they
thought were the most important and pressing" issues at the FCC.  "At the top
of my list," Mr. May told TR, "was changing the strategic focus of the FCC
toward becoming a market deregulator."

SBC Communications, Inc., recently submitted a paper to the Bush team
recommending, among other things, "closing the reciprocal compensation
loophole" and "ensuring that the marketplace regulates broadband Internet
service," an SBC spokesman told TR.

SBC also proposed eliminating the "duplicative review of mergers" that
carriers face at the FCC and Department of Justice.  But SBC didn't specify
which review should be phased out.  "That's the policy question that needs to
be answered by the new administration," he said.

Even telecom interests that weren't represented on the FCC transition
advisory team have forwarded their telecom agendas to the Bush
administration.

In a letter sent to President-elect Bush on Jan. 18, the National Telephone
Cooperative Association advised him to appoint FCC commissioners who "
understand rural America" and give "considerable thought to rural
representation" at NTIA.

The Association for Local Telecommunications Services has submitted a paper
calling the "the failure" of incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to
open their networks one of the "three greatest market failures that stymie
full, effective competition."

"According to the FCC, after almost five years, the ILECs have opened their
networks to competitors in only two states," ALTS wrote.  "As a result,
[competitive local exchange carriers] have great difficulty interconnecting
with the Bell company networks to provide advanced services."

The Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association has had "extensive
conversations" with the Bush team about spectrum management issues, wireless
location privacy principles, repealing the 3% federal excise tax on telephone
bills, and moving from intercarrier compensation for wireless calls to a "
bill-and-keep" regime, a CTIA spokesman told TR last week.

FCC Focuses on International Detariffing, Intercarrier Compensation in
Biennial Review

The FCC has asked its staff to prepare proposals to eliminate or streamline a
broad range of Commission rules, including those governing intercarrier
compensation for terminating telecom traffic, wireless licensing terms and
renewals, and international service tariffs for nondominant interexchange
carriers.

The FCC issued its directives in a report released Jan. 17 in Common Carrier
docket 00-175.  The biennial regulatory review provisions of the
Communications Act of 1934 require the agency in even-numbered years to
decide whether given rules remain in the public interest, the FCC said.

The FCC doesn't have to take final action repealing or modifying the rules in
the even-numbered years, it said.

The latest FCC directives reflect staff recommendations outlined in a revised
version of the September 2000 staff report on the biennial regulatory review
(TR, Sept. 25, 2000).  The FCC wants the Common Carrier Bureau to prepare
rulemaking notices on the following:

Identifying alternative approaches to inter-carrier compensation "that
are more consistent with the long-term development of competition";

Excluding rural telcos from the requirements that independent incumbent
local exchange carriers provide interexchange service through separate
subsidiaries;

Simplifying FCC review of the "average schedules" used in determining
certain telcos' costs and shares of the National Exchange Carrier
Association, Inc.'s revenue pools; and

Changing the schedule for NECA board elections to reduce the
administrative costs of the association, which was created by FCC directive
to maintain access charge tariffs for many local exchange carriers.

The International Bureau will prepare rulemaking notices to initiate the
following streamlining efforts:

Extending the detariffing regime adopted for domestic interexchange
services to the international services of nondominant interexchange carriers,
"including commercial mobile radio service providers and U.S. carriers
classified as dominant solely because of foreign affiliations";

Further streamlining the earth station and space station licensing
processes;

Requiring electronic filing of applications for earth station licenses, to
save processing time;

Expanding the availability of pro forma transfers of control and
assignments of international facilities authorizations under section 214 of
the Communications Act of 1934; and

Reducing the reporting burdens for international telecom carriers.

The FCC asked the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau to prepare rulemaking
notices to pursue the following streamlining goals:

Considering whether to eliminate restrictions "on the aggregate amount of
broadband PCS (personal communications service), cellular, and specialized
mobile radio spectrum that an entity can hold in any market";

Extending license terms beyond 10 years and implementing automatic or
default renewal procedures to avoid late-filing problems;

Considering partially privatizing the site-by-site, frequency-by-frequency
licensing process for the private and common carrier microwave services;

Bringing the technical and operational rules-including radiated power
restrictions-for cellular service, PCS, and general wireless communications
service into conformity with each other;

Considering whether any of its part 22 (cellular) rules are obsolete as a
result of competitive or technological developments; and

Bringing its radio frequency emission regulations into compliance with the
International Telecommunication Union's radio regulations.

And the Commission asked its Office of Engineering and Technology to prepare
rulemaking notices to address the following issues:

Clarifying a variety of equipment authorization rules and eliminating
ambiguities in equipment test procedures, including authorization procedures
for transmitters that operate both in the U.S. and overseas; and

Reviewing the emission limits on devices that operate in spectrum above 2
gigahertz.

The FCC also agreed with a staff recommendation that when it evaluates new
rules, it should use criteria similar to that used in the biennial review to
evaluate existing rules.  It stopped short, however, of adopting any criteria
in binding rules or procedures.

The FCC rejected a proposal the U.S. Telecom Association had offered in
comments on the September staff report (TR, Oct. 16, 2000).  USTA had asked
the FCC to set a firm time limit for acting to eliminate rules identified as
unnecessary during biennial reviews.

Citing the need to make the best use of its limited resources and to retain
flexibility, the FCC directed all bureaus and offices "to prioritize
rulemaking proceedings stemming from this biennial review on the basis of
various public policy considerations and a comprehensive evaluation of
comments received" in response to the planned rulemaking notices.

Issuing a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said the
FCC shouldn't view the biennial reviews as "a burden to be endured or a hoop
through which we must dutifully jump every other year."  He added, "As the
Commission moves forward, it is my sincere hope that we will devote
full-time, year-round staff to this endeavor.

Furchtgott-Roth Says Departure Of Kennard Won't Bring Deadlock

Although the departure of FCC Chairman William E. Kennard leaves the agency
temporarily with four members-two Republicans and two Democrats-Commissioner
Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth doesn't expect the agency to be deadlocked.

"A lot is made about the political divisions" at the FCC, he said Jan. 18
during his monthly briefing with reporters.  "But I really don't see it at
all."

About 90% of the FCC's votes over the past three years have been unanimous,
Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said.  Only about 2% or 3% have been 3-2 votes, he
estimated.  So it's unlikely that many votes will be deadlocked with the two
Republicans-Mr. Furchtgott-Roth and Michael Powell-voting against Democratic
Commissioners Susan Ness and Gloria Tristani, he said.

Mr. Furchtgott-Roth commended then-Chairman Kennard for not trying to push "
11th-hour" initiatives before leaving the agency.  "A lot of people were
worried that some things might be railroaded through," he said.  "Chairman
Kennard has been very principled about this, not trying to do a lot of
11th-hour rules."

Meanwhile, Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said, the FCC had made "significant progress"
in its second "biennial review" of its regulations.  The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 directs the FCC to review its regulations every two years and to
eliminate or revise any rules that are no longer necessary or in the public
interest.

Last week, the FCC issued a report on what rule changes it would propose as a
result of its second biennial review (see separate story).

The report represents a "substantial improvement over the really pathetic
effort that was done two years ago" when the agency conducted its first
biennial review (TR, Jan. 4, 1999), Mr. Furchtgott-Roth said.

Mr. Furchtgott-Roth also reiterated his complaints about the FCC's
coordination with other agencies in reviewing mergers and related license
transfers.  Regarding the proposed Deutsche Telekom AG-VoiceStream Wireless
Corp. merger, Mr. Furchtgott-Roth disagreed with the FCC's decision to put
its review on hold while the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation probe national security concerns (TR, Dec. 25,
2000).

He said it would be inappropriate for the FCC to impose conditions on the
merger that are requested by DoJ and FBI.  That, however, has been the FCC's
practice in past merger reviews, he said.

Time Warner Telecom, Inc., intends to raise as much as $700 million through
the sale of stock and debt securities to help pay for its acquisition of GST
Telecommunications, Inc.  Time Warner Telecom, of Littleton, Colo., revealed
its plan in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The funds
would be used to repay an unsecured bridge loan that was used to pay for GST,
Time Warner Telecom said.  Further details of the fundraising effort will be
disclosed in future filings, it said.  Time Warner Telecom recently completed
the $690 million acquisition of GST, a competitive local exchange carrier
that was in bankruptcy (TR, Sept. 18, 2000).

UWB Operations Feasible In 3-6 GHz Band, NTIA Says

Ultrawideband (UWB) devices likely can operate in spectrum between 3 and 6
gigahertz without harming incumbent users, including fixed satellite service
(FSS) operators, according to test results released last week by the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration.  But NTIA said that steps
to mitigate interference probably would be necessary.

NTIA has been studying the interference potential of UWB devices since last
year as part of a rulemaking proceeding launched by the FCC to explore
allowing UWB devices to operate on an unlicensed basis under part 15 of its
rules (TR, Nov. 6, 2000).

Separate tests of UWB devices' effect on Global Positioning System (GPS)
receivers are expected to be released next month.  The test results released
last week involved only non-GPS operations.

Results Will Aid Decision Making

NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said at a Jan. 18 news conference that
the test results "will form the basis of negotiations between NTIA and the
FCC to develop a final rule that will permit the development and availability
of ultrawideband technologies."

UWB devices use precisely timed pulses of radio frequency (RF) energy spread
across a wide swath of spectrum at extremely low power.  Proponents of the
technology have hailed its potential in myriad applications, including law
enforcement, fire and rescue services, the military, medicine, education, and
home and office local area networks (TR, Sept 18, 2000).  They say it won't
interfere with existing systems.

But aviation groups, the GPS and satellite industries, and others have
expressed concern that the devices could interfere with existing systems.
They've asked the FCC to hold off approving their use until tests show they
won't cause such interference.

In its tests, NTIA assessed the interference potential of five UWB devices on
federal air-route surveillance radar, airport surveillance radar, and air
traffic control beacon systems.

Based on the results of those tests, NTIA engineers developed mathematical
models to analyze the impact of UWB devices on nine other systems, including
those operating between 3100 and 5650 megahertz, or 3.1 and 5.65 GHz.  The
tests indicated UWB devices could operate in that range, although limits
might need to be placed on power levels, distance, and pulse-repetition
frequency.  However, there's a question about whether UWB devices would have
a "big enough window" to operate if restrictions are imposed, Mr. Rohde said.

Among those operating in that spectrum are FSS users (3.7-4.2 GHz), microwave
landing services (5.03-5.091 GHz), and Doppler weather radar (5.6-5.65 GHz).
For FSS systems, "the worst-case situation" with regard to interference "
would occur for receivers located at ground level with a low antenna
elevation angle of 5 degrees,"  NTIA's report said.  There would be much less
interference potential for FSS systems on tops of buildings or with higher
elevation angles, it said.

"However, at this time uncertainty exists as to the effect of UWB signal duty
cycle on the performance of FSS earth stations which have digital signal
processing," the report said.  "This information would assist in establishing
the UWB signal peak power limit; NTIA study is continuing on this important
consideration."

Regarding microwave landing services, UWB operations at power limits
currently permitted for part 15 devices may exceed the receiver interference
protection standard.  More analysis of the effect on such systems is needed,
NTIA said.

Tests on systems operating between 900 and 1610 MHz and 1610-3100 MHz
suggested there could be significant interference problems with incumbent
systems, NTIA officials said at the news conference.

But NTIA's report indicated that UWB operations below 3.1 GHz were possible.
It said that while UWB operations in that spectrum "will be quite
challenging," mitigating factors "could relax restrictions" on UWB devices.

It also said that UWB emission levels would have to be significantly reduced
to guard against interference.  And it concluded that further studies are
needed to assess degradation of existing systems, as well as relative levels
of noise, interference, and "clutter signals."

Mr. Rohde said NTIA engineers used existing standards for determining the
potential interference of UWB devices.  "Obviously this is going to be an
area that'll be the subject of a lot of debate. . .as to what really is the
criteria that determines interference," he added.

Findings Draw Praise

NTIA's test results drew praise from the UWB industry.  Officials of Time
Domain Corp., a leading marketer of UWB technology, said they were still
reviewing NTIA's findings.  But they indicated they were happy the tests
showed the devices could share non-GPS spectrum.

"While we have questions regarding some of the conclusions made by NTIA, we
are pleased that the test results confirm that compatible operation of UWB
devices with government services is possible," said Jeffrey L. Ross, Time
Domain's vice president-corporate development and strategy.  "We have full
confidence that the FCC will impose appropriate regulations and power limits,
and look forward to the FCC's timely completion of its rulemaking," he added.

Last year, Time Domain questioned NTIA's testing methods, saying they must
reflect real-world conditions to be accurate (TR, Sept. 4, 2000).

Another developer of UWB devices, Fantasma Networks, Inc., also hailed the
test results.  "We are confident that our deployment of ultrawideband
[devices] does not pose a threat of harmful interference to public safety
agencies or to any other user of the radio spectrum," said Roberto Aiello,
Fantasma's chief technology officer.

Angelos Amends Lawsuit Against Wireless Industry

As expected, noted plaintiffs' attorney Peter G. Angelos has entered the
legal fray against the wireless industry over the safety of mobile phones.
Mr. Angelos has filed an amended lawsuit on behalf of a Maryland doctor who
claims that using a mobile phone caused his brain tumor (TR, Aug. 7 and Dec.
25, 2000).

The lawsuit, filed last week in the U.S. District Court in Maryland, seeks
$375 million in compensatory damages and $750 million in punitive damages.

The lawsuit says the industry failed to conduct adequate testing on the
health effects of mobile phones and warn consumers about known risks.  The
industry "manipulated the results of other testing, concealed evidence that
[mobile phone] radiation is harmful and suppressed scientific and medical
research," the lawsuit alleges.

According to the lawsuit, the medical and scientific communities have been
aware of the biological effects of radio frequency (RF) exposure since the
1920s.  The wireless industry was or should have been aware of evidence of
such health hazards, the lawsuit alleges.

Michael F. Altschul, vice president and general counsel of the Cellular
Telecommunications & Internet Association, which is named in the lawsuit,
said he hadn't seen the amended complaint.

"Regardless of who the lawyer is. . .the legal requirements remain the same,"
Mr. Altschul said.  The plaintiffs have to show a link between RF radiation
exposure and cancer, he said, and "that science just isn't there."  Spokesmen
for Motorola, Inc., and Verizon Communications, Inc., which also are named as
defendants, have made similar points.

Last week's amended lawsuit, Christopher J. Newman et al. v. Motorola, Inc.,
et al. (case no. CCB-00-2609) was filed after U.S. District Judge Catherine
C. Blake last month dismissed a number of the counts in the original filing
but gave the plaintiffs permission to amend their complaint.  The wireless
industry had succeeded in moving the case from Baltimore City Circuit Court
to federal court.

Mr. Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, has won major cases against the
asbestos industry and represented Maryland in litigation against the tobacco
industry.  John A. Pica, a lawyer in Mr. Angelos' Baltimore firm, has been
quoted saying Mr. Angelos plans to file 10 lawsuits this year against the
wireless industry.  Messrs. Angelos and Pica could not be reached for comment.

Bob Gordon, a consultant to Baltimore attorney Joanne Lynch Suder, who filed
the original lawsuit on behalf of the Maryland doctor, said Mr. Angelos
agreed to be the co-counsel in a number of cases that Ms. Suder planned to
file against the phone industry.  Lawyers around the country also are working
on the planned litigation, he said.

Meanwhile last week, German researchers said there could be a link between
the use of mobile phones and cancer of the inner eye.  The results were
published in the January issue of the research journal Epidemiology.

But the researchers, who interviewed 118 subjects with eye cancer and a
control group of 475 people, said their findings were inconclusive because of
the study's limitations.  In a statement, CTIA cited those limitations and
the small size of the study group.

NTIA Proposes Reimbursement Procedures For Relocated Government Spectrum Users

The National Telecommunications and Information Administration is proposing
procedures for relocating federal government spectrum incumbents to other
bands to make way for commercial users.  Among the issues to be decided are
the circumstances under which incumbents will be required to relocate and
which relocation costs will be eligible for reimbursement.

NTIA Administrator Gregory L. Rohde said the rules could bolster a high-level
effort to identify and allocate spectrum for third-generation (3G) wireless
services.  Then-President Clinton launched the initiative by executive
memorandum in October 2000 (TR, Oct. 16, Nov. 6, and Nov. 20, 2000; and Jan.
8).

As part of that effort, NTIA is studying the possible use of the 1755-1850
megahertz band, which is used heavily by the Defense Department.  The FCC is
analyzing use of the 2500-2690 MHz band, which is used mostly by multichannel
multipoint distribution service and instructional television fixed service
operators.

NTIA's proposed rules would cover such future reallocations, Mr. Rohde said
at an industry-government meeting on the 3G plan last week.  He said he hoped
the final rules would be released this summer.

The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 1999 required private
entities to reimburse federal spectrum users for the cost of relocating or
modifying their systems because of reallocation.  The notice of proposed
rulemaking NTIA released Jan. 17 suggests ways to implement that mandate.
Comments are due March 19 with replies due April 18 in docket no.
001206341-0341-01.

In its rulemaking notice, NTIA seeks comments on whether federal government
spectrum incumbents should be required to relocate if sharing is technically
possible in their present bands.

If the incumbents are not required to relocate, under what conditions should
they be permitted to remain in their current bands and who would pay for any
system modifications that would improve spectrum sharing? NTIA asks.  For
example, it asks, should the federal incumbent be allowed to stay in the band
on a noninterference basis with 3G systems?

NTIA suggests that federal incumbents not be forced to relocate until a "
comparable facility" is available for a reasonable period of time.  It
defines comparable facility as one that has the same or superior operational
capabilities as the original spectrum.  NTIA suggests using four factors to
determine comparability:  (1) communications throughput, (2) system
reliability, (3) operating costs, and (4) operational capability.  It seeks
comments on its definition and whether the four factors are sufficient.

NTIA outlines which relocation costs should be eligible for reimbursement.
It also suggests a process for resolving differences over those costs,
including a mandatory negotiation period, third-party mediation, and
nonbinding arbitration.

NTIA seeks comments on what type of cost-sharing plan to adopt and asks
whether a "band manager" or some other entity should serve as a clearinghouse
to administer the plan.  And it wants input on whether it should "sunset" a
cost-sharing plan five years after any auction of former government
spectrum.  The rulemaking notice also seeks comment on how to treat spectrum
with classified frequency assignments.

At the direction of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the
Balanced Budget Act of 1997, NTIA identified 255 MHz of spectrum that can be
reallocated from federal government to private use.  The bands identified for
which federal incumbents would qualify for reimbursement are 216-220 MHz,
1432-1435 MHz, 1710-1755 MHz, and 2385-2390 MHz.

The FCC has proposed allocating the 1710-1755 MHz band for 3G services.  In
addition, Mr. Rohde said the reimbursement rules would apply to the 1755-1850
MHz band if federal incumbents there are relocated under the 3G initiative.

Rohde Uncertain of Effort's Future

At last week's 3G meeting, Mr. Rohde said he didn't know if the Bush
administration would make any changes to the 3G effort, which is operating on
a tight schedule that calls for the FCC to issue licenses for 3G spectrum by
Sept. 30, 2002.  But he said he had stressed its importance in his dealings
with Bush transition team staff members.  "I can't predict what's going to
happen" beyond Inauguration Day, Mr. Rohde told reporters.

The Bush transition team staff member responsible for NTIA, James Derderian,
a former Republican staff director of the House Commerce Committee, couldn't
be reached for comment.  But at his confirmation hearing for Commerce
secretary earlier this month, Donald L. Evans said the Bush administration
was committed to finding 3G spectrum (TR, Jan. 8).

Industry Expresses Frustration

At last week's meeting, several industry representatives expressed
frustration that they didn't have access to data they said they needed to
make recommendations on use of the 1755-1850 MHz and 2500-2690 MHz bands in
time for NTIA and the FCC to consider.  Industry representatives in
NTIA-established working groups are reviewing the bands.

The 3G initiative calls for final reports on the two bands to be released in
March, with the FCC issuing an order allocating the selected spectrum in July.

Rick Kemper, director-wireless technology and security for the Cellular
Telecommunications & Internet Association, said determining the cost of
relocating incumbents or whether band sharing or segmentation was feasible
requires information on how many systems operate in the frequencies and how
they are being used.  But he said that data wasn't available.

Donald Brittingham, director-wireless policy for Verizon Wireless, said he
was concerned that the final band studies wouldn't reflect all the industry's
input.  He urged the regulators to delay releasing the reports.

"One concern is we're going to do a lot of work and in the end it will be too
late to be included in your final report," added Joanne C. Wilson,
director-global public affairs for Lucent Technologies, Inc.

Frederick R. Wentland, NTIA's director-spectrum plans and policies, said some
information wouldn't  be available until the final band studies were
released.  "Unfortunately, time happens to be our enemy here," Mr. Wentland
added.

But he urged industry officials to continue participating in the process,
including filing comments in response to the FCC's recent notice of proposed
rulemaking on 3G spectrum (TR, Jan. 8).

Diane J. Cornell, associate chief of the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications
Bureau, said the current process was designed "to crystalize the issues," and
she urged industry engineers to focus on technical issues concerning band
sharing and segmentation.

Ms. Cornell also said industry should submit comments in response to NTIA's
notice and an FCC rulemaking notice released in November 2000 suggesting
allocations for 27 MHz of spectrum transferred from government to private use
(TR, Nov. 27, 2000).

After the final band studies are released in March, she said, "I expect there
will be differences of perspectives."  She said industry officials would get
another chance to submit comments after that.

Antenna-Rule Violations Prompt Proposed Forfeitures of $327K

The FCC and its Enforcement Bureau have proposed that two wireless carriers
and two tower companies pay $327,000 for violations of its antenna rules.

The largest proposed forfeiture was against American Tower Corp. for 36
violations in 14 states and Washington, D.C.  The FCC has ordered the
Enforcement Bureau to conduct a more thorough investigation of American Tower'
s compliance with its rules.

Separately, the Enforcement Bureau proposed an $80,000 forfeiture against
Telecorp Communications, Inc.; an $18,000 forfeiture against AT&T Wireless
Services, Inc.; and an $17,000 forfeiture against SpectraSite Corp.

In a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture, the FCC said American Tower
failed to (1) properly light an antenna during construction, (2) register two
existing antennas, (3) notify the agency of ownership changes involving 24
antennas, and (4) post registration numbers on nine antennas.

"We are concerned that ATC continues to violate our rules despite both oral
and written warnings regarding the Commission's antenna structure
requirements," the FCC said in its Jan. 16 forfeiture notice.  It said more
than half of American Tower's 36 violations were uncovered after a July 2000
meeting between FCC field agents and American Tower officials.

In separate notices released the same day, the Enforcement Bureau found that
Telecorp failed to light antennas properly on four occasions and that AT&T
Wireless failed to post antenna registration numbers on nine occasions.  It
also found that SpectraSite failed to post antenna registration numbers on
four occasions and failed to notify the FCC of ownership changes on three
occasions.  The violations were discovered by FCC field agents during routine
investigations and inspections.

Russell Wilkerson, director-corporate affairs for TeleCorp PCS, Inc., told TR
, "We're talking to our folks in the field. . .to compare the cases by the
FCC and some of their findings and then we will respond to them."  He added, "
We make it a practice to follow the FCC rules and regulations."  Spokesman
for the three other companies could not be reached for comment.

Fifth Circuit Joins Chorus On State Immunity Issue

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit (New Orleans), echoing three
other appellate circuits, has ruled that the U.S. Constitution doesn't
protect state utility commissions from federal judicial review of their
decisions regarding carrier interconnection agreements.

In a two-to-one decision issued Jan. 16, the Fifth Circuit rejected 11th
Amendment immunity claims raised by the Louisiana Public Service Commission
during proceedings stemming from a lawsuit filed by AT&T Corp.  AT&T was
challenging the PSC's 1997 arbitration decision regarding its interconnection
agreement with BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc.

Section 252 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 directed state commissions
to review, approve, and, when necessary, arbitrate carrier interconnection
agreements.  The Act also says that parties aggrieved by state commission
determinations in carrier interconnection proceedings can ask the appropriate
federal district court to the review the carrier agreement.

In AT&T Communications v. BellSouth Telecommunications, Inc., et al. (case
no. 99-30421), the Fifth Circuit reversed a ruling by the U.S. District Court
in Baton Rouge.  The lower court had held that the 11th Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution prohibited such lawsuits against state agencies or employees.
(AT&T had named the PSC and its individual commissioners in the lawsuit).

The 11th Amendment grants states immunity from being sued in federal courts.
But states may lose that immunity under an exception carved out by the U.S.
Supreme Court in its 1908 decision in Ex parte Young.  The Ex parte Young
doctrine allows lawsuits against state employees in order to prevent ongoing
violations of federal law.

The Fifth Circuit found that the PSC and the commissioners had waived their
constitutional sovereign immunity rights by agreeing to arbitrate the
interconnection dispute under the provisions of the 1996 Act.  The court also
ruled that the Ex parte Young doctrine applied to AT&T's request for
prospective injunctive relief from PSC arbitration rulings that AT&T had
argued contravened the interconnection requirements of sections 251 and 252
of the Act.

The appeals court reversed the district court's ruling and remanded the case
for further proceedings.  Circuit Judge James L. Dennis wrote the opinion and
was joined by Judge Henry A. Politz.  Judge Jerry E. Smith dissented from the
majority's opinion.

Finding Echoes Other Circuits

Appeals courts in the Sixth, Seventh, and 10th Circuits already have held
that the Ex parte Young exception applies to federal court challenges to
state commission decisions affecting carrier interconnection agreements (TR,
April 5 and Oct. 25, 1999; and Jan. 24, June 26, and July 31, 2000).  Last
fall, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the issue in a case arising in
the Sixth Circuit (TR, Oct. 9, 2000).

In his dissent, Judge Smith cited the U.S. Supreme Court's 1996 decision in
Seminole Tribe v. Florida.  Under that ruling, he said, Congress' referral of
disputes surrounding state commission-arbitrated interconnection agreements "
supplants" a party's ability to sue the state commission under the 1908
Supreme Court decision in Ex parte Young.  But, he added, Congress' referral
of such disputes to the federal courts violates the 11th Amendment to the
Constitution.

The Chicago-based Seventh Circuit rejected a similar argument last year in
which state utility commissioners had invoked Seminole Tribe (TR, July 31,
2000).

AeA Seeking Federal Preemption Of Multiple State Privacy Laws

Lawmakers in the 107th Congress should make federal preemption of multiple
state privacy laws "one of the top legislative concerns" for the coming
session, according to AeA, formerly the American Electronics Association.
Federal privacy legislation "should play a crucial role" in maintaining
consistency and certainty" in the marketplace, said William T. Archer, AeA's
president and chief executive officer.

Mr. Archer warned, however, that "poorly crafted legislation" could have the
unintended effect of "imposing burdensome, impractical new requirements" on
e-commerce and Internet businesses.  "Only the federal government is in a
position to create uniform U.S. privacy standards and work for international
harmonization," he said.  "Otherwise, online business could face 50
conflicting sets of privacy rules.  Consumers and businesses alike would
lose."

AeA urged lawmakers Jan. 18 to consider its "privacy principles" in drafting
federal preemption legislation.  The principles recommend creating uniform,
technology-neutral national standards to protect privacy.

AeA wants standards to require merchants to notify consumers of
information-collection practices, while allowing them to "opt out of the use
or disclosure" of information if it's unrelated to the initial transactions
between consumers and merchants.

The AeA principles also urge lawmakers to build on private-sector privacy
seal programs and privacy codes while relying on the Federal Trade Commission'
s existing authority to enforce data-collection notice requirements.

Libraries Mull Legal Challenge To New Internet-Filtering Law

The American Library Association (ALA) has been given the green light from
its executive board to launch a court challenge of the Children's Internet
Protection Act (CIPA)  The law passed last year (TR, June 12, 2000) requires
schools and libraries to install Internet- filtering software if they use
federal funds-such as universal service "E-rate" support-to purchase
computers or connect to the Internet.

ALA said its executive board had authorized the legal action "after more than
a week of intense discussions among leaders and members during the
association's annual midwinter meeting."

ALA announced Jan. 18 that it was "researching and exploring its options in
preparation for litigation," as it believes the law infringes on freedoms
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

The First Amendment protects free exercise of religion, free speech, freedom
of the press, freedom to assemble, and freedom to petition the government for
redress of grievances.

The Internet-filtering requirements would affect three federal funding
streams that libraries frequently use to purchase computer equipment or
connect to the Internet, ALA said.  They are the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act, the Library Services and Technology Act, and the E-rate
program.

"All three programs help ensure schools and libraries provide access to the
resources communities need to thrive in the Information Age," ALA said.  "
CIPA runs counter to these federal efforts to close the digital divide for
all Americans."

Think Tank Slams City Telecom Efforts

Through government-owned telecom networks, some states and cities are trying
to make sure their constituents don't have to wait for advanced telecom
services.  But such efforts are counterproductive, according to a paper
released by the Progress & Freedom Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank.

"Governments that have entered the telecom-munications business have been
saddled with financial losses and obsolete, legacy technologies.
Furthermore, government entry in the marketplace distorts incentives and
slows the development of private-sector competition," writes PFF President
Jeffrey A. Eisenach, author of Does Government Belong in the Telecom Business?

He views the pace of state and local government entry into telecom and
Internet service businesses as "rapid and increasing," citing efforts by
municipally owned utilities on Long Island, N.Y.; in Los Angeles; and in
Chicago.  The paper lists 233 municipal utilities that were providing one or
more of the following services in 1998:

Cable TV,

Internet access,

High-speed data,

Broadband data resale,

Local telephony,

Long distance services,

Leased fiber, and

Municipal data network services.

Of these services, the most commonly offered by municipalities is cable TV
service, according to the PFF findings.  Eighty-seven cities offered cable TV
service, compared with 73 cities that run data networks and 61 that provide
Internet access.  Only 18 cities were found to be offering local telephony,
and 10 cities offered long distance service.

Seven states had 11 or more cities offering telecom services:  22 cities in
Iowa, including Cedar Falls; 16 cities in Minnesota; 12 cities in Georgia; 12
cities in Missouri, including Columbia and Springfield; 11 cities in Florida,
including Gainesville and Tallahassee; 11 cities in Massachusetts; and 11
cities in Texas, including Brownsville and College Station.

Verizon Adds Data To Boost Massachusetts InterLATA Bid

Officials at Verizon New England are counting on new data to satisfy
regulators' concerns about its application to provide interLATA (local access
and transport area) services in Massachusetts.  Early last week, Verizon
again asked the FCC to allow it to enter that market; late last month, the
company withdrew a similar pending application it had filed last fall.

The officials are hoping the new data will answer questions regulators raised
about last fall's application, including whether the telco provides
nondiscriminatory access to DSL (digital subscriber line)- capable loops (TR,
Dec. 25, 2000).

Under section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, a Bell company must
obtain FCC approval before providing in-region interLATA services.  The FCC
must determine whether the company has met a 14-point "competitive checklist"
of market-opening mandates laid out in the Act.

Thomas J. Tauke, Verizon's senior vice president-external affairs and public
policy, said that the new filing "demonstrates that we provide
nondiscriminatory access to lines other DSL providers lease from us, as well
as parity of service for installation and repair."

FCC Chairman William E. Kennard had focused on Verizon's provisioning of
DSL-capable loops when the company withdrew its original Massachusetts
application.  He cautioned Verizon that it should include in a new
application "verified data reflecting acceptable levels of performance,
including an independent showing for loops used to provide advanced services."

But competitors aren't so sure that the new application addresses those
concerns-and other concerns raised in comments to the FCC.  Verizon "still
didn't get it right," AT&T Corp. Vice President-federal government affairs
Len Cali said, adding that the "refiled application has failed to adequately
address the shortcomings of the original application."  AT&T particularly
objected to Verizon's prices for unbundled network elements, saying they
still weren't cost-based, as required by the Act.

Verizon included in its application last week new rates for switched services
provided to competitors in Massachusetts.  It had informed the FCC of the new
rates in ex parte filings regarding the earlier application.  Competitors had
complained that the FCC shouldn't consider those rates in reviewing the
earlier application because they were submitted after comment deadlines in
the proceeding.  "Refiling puts to rest any concerns that interested parties
did not have the opportunity to comment on all the issues," Mr. Tauke said.

The FCC now has 90 days to consider the new application.  Under section 271,
it must consult with Massachusetts regulators and the Department of Justice
before issuing a decision.  Justice had given Verizon's original application
a thumbs-down (TR, Oct. 30, 2000).  The Massachusetts Department of
Telecommunications and Energy had recommended that the FCC approve it (TR,
Oct. 23, 2000).

The DTE's recommendation to the FCC is due Feb. 6; Justice must submit its
recommendation by Feb. 21.  Comments and replies are due to the FCC by Jan.
30 and Feb. 28, respectively.  Parties also are invited to meet with Common
Carrier Bureau staff for ex parte discussions about the proceeding between
Jan. 30 and Feb. 23.

Bureau Proposes SBC Pay $94K For Violating Collocation Rules

The FCC's Enforcement Bureau has found SBC Communications, Inc., apparently
liable for violating Commission rules regarding competitors' collocation of
equipment in incumbents' central offices.  Specifically, the bureau says SBC
failed to update its Web site to identify facilities that have run out of
physical collocation space.

In a Jan. 18 notice of apparent liability (file EB-00-IH-0326a), the bureau
proposed that SBC forfeit $94,500 for the alleged infraction, which the
bureau uncovered during an "independent audit."  The FCC made the audit a
condition of its approval of license transfers related to the merger of SBC
Communications, Inc., and Ameritech Corp. (TR, Oct. 11, 1999).

The FCC's "posting rule" requires incumbent local exchange carriers to update
their Web sites to list premises that run out of space for competitors to
install facilities.  They must provide those updates within 10 days of using
up the space.  But information provided by SBC to the bureau indicates that
in "numerous instances" SBC failed to provide timely updates to its Web site.

SBC has 30 days to pay the $94,500 or file a written statement showing why
the proposed forfeiture should be eliminated or reduced.

FCC Gets `Ahead of the Curve' With Inquiry on Interactive TV

Although the market for high-speed interactive TV (ITV) services is in the
early stages of development, the FCC hopes to get "ahead of the curve" by
collecting information on the status of the ITV market and whether it should
regulate it.

The FCC issued the notice of inquiry in Cable Services docket 01-7 because
comments in its recently completed proceeding on the America Online, Inc.-
Time Warner, Inc., merger (TR, Jan. 15) "raised the possibility" that a
vertically integrated cable TV and ITV service provider could discriminate
against alternative ITV service providers.  It asked for comments in the
docket 01-7 proceeding by March 19 and replies by April 20.

The inquiry seeks comment on what services constitute ITV services, how they
will be delivered, and other questions about the status of the ITV market.
The FCC acknowledged that it was "difficult to specify a definition" for ITV
services because of the technological and business changes in the new
industry.  It sought comment on its initial characterization of ITV as a "
service that supports subscriber-initiated choices or actions that are
related to one or more video programming streams.."

The FCC asked about the technical resources or "building blocks" a
distribution system would require to support ITV.  The FCC said it saw three
major building blocks:  (1) a video stream, (2) a two-way high-speed Internet
protocol connection, and (3) specialized customer premises equipment.

"To assess the possibilities for discriminatory behavior and what enforcement
procedures might be effective for any rules that might be proposed in the
future, it is important to understand clearly how ITV providers will deliver
their services to consumers, including what type of contractual arrangements
will govern," the FCC said.

It also asked whether cable TV providers would have the "superior platform"
for distribution of high-speed ITV service and sought comment on the ITV
capabilities of direct broadcast satellite providers and digital subscriber
line service providers.  The FCC also sought comment on the legal
classifications of ITV services, what public and statutory objectives ITV
rules would promote, and what authority the FCC has over such services.

The notice states that the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992 directed the FCC to adopt rules "limiting the share
of cable capacity that could be used for commonly owned content and requiring
vertically integrated cable programmers to provide their content to rival
distribution platforms on nondiscriminatory terms."  The FCC added that if
the "same factual predicates that Congress cited in the 1992 Cable Act were
to apply to a distribution platform delivering ITV services, then some
regulation of those distribution facilities might be warranted."

The notice also asks for comment on how the FCC could implement rules to bar
providers of multichannel video programming from discriminating against
unaffiliated ITV providers.  It asked for comment on how nondiscrimination
rules should be enforced.  It suggested that ITV providers and cable TV
operators "rely on private enforcement arrangements" or that aggrieved
parties use the FCC's complaint procedures.

Kennard Warns against Discrimination

Then-FCC Chairman William E. Kennard acknow-ledged that ITV services were in
the "early stages of development" but said the FCC would "do well to get
ahead of the curve."  He said it was "clear" that cable TV would be an "
important platform for delivery of ITV services, at least in the near term,
and I am concerned that a vertically integrated ITV service provider might
have the incentive and ability to discriminate against unaffiliated ITV
service providers."

Commissioner Gloria Tristani supported the inquiry but "regretted" that the
FCC issued an inquiry rather than a notice of proposed rulemaking.  "This
Commission must move promptly to ascertain the public interest in nascent
industries to ensure appropriate measures are timely vetted and resolved,"
she said.

Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth dissented from the FCC's decision,
saying it was "premature" to address the issue of cable interactive TV
services.  "While the item is framed as a notice of inquiry, it is no less
damaging to raise the specter of government regulation. . .for services that
are still in their gestational period."  He said he had "serious
reservations" about the FCC's legal authority to address ITV issues.

Robert Sachs, president and chief executive officer of the National Cable
Television Association, was "pleased" that the FCC was launching an inquiry
rather than a "rulemaking which presumes a regulatory outcome."  But he added
that "asking dozens of hypothetical questions about regulating a business
which has yet to take form still puts the cart before the horse, in
regulatory terms. . .There is no evidence to suggest that government
regulation is called for here."

Analysts See Shifting Alliance As BellSouth Sells Qwest Stock

It was the rumor du jour 21 months ago:  BellSouth Corp.'s purchase of a 10%
stake in Qwest Communications International, Inc., meant the companies might
merge.  Times have changed, however, and BellSouth now is cashing in much of
its Qwest investment to raise $1 billion for other projects.

"The transaction underscores a change in the direction of the relationship
between Qwest and BellSouth," said Marion Boucher Soper, a Bear, Stearns &
Co. analyst, in a Jan. 16 report.  "While both appear to be interested in
strategic expansion, other opportunities are likely to be higher on the
priority list."

BellSouth's 10% stake already has been diluted to about 5% by Qwest's
acquisition of U S WEST, Inc., Merrill Lynch & Co. analyst Adam Quinton
noted.  "The gradual dilution and now sell down of the BellSouth stake speaks
to the changing nature of the relationship between the two," Mr. Quinton said
in a report also issued Jan. 16.

"BellSouth seems to be indicating it has other strategic priorities and that
securing a strong relationship with a leading `next-gen' long distance
provider can be done via commercial relationships, which do not need the
backing of any equity position," Mr. Quinton said.

"Realistically, BellSouth's investment in Qwest is not strategic to its
long-term growth strategy, and the $1 billion in proceeds will give it cash
on hand," said Goldman, Sachs & Co. analysts Kathryn D. Willing and Frank J.
Governali.

"We were a very different company two years ago when they invested in us,"
said Joseph P. Nacchio, Qwest's chairman and chief executive officer.  If
BellSouth now needs cash instead of Qwest stock, Mr. Nacchio said, "I'm glad
to be strong enough now to be able to help out."

The transaction satisfies both companies' needs, analysts said.  It gives
BellSouth a cash infusion to spend on deployment of digital subscriber line
service and on its wireless initiatives in the U.S. and Latin America.

Qwest, on the other hand, gains the opportunity to boost its stock value, Mr.
Quinton said.  "Qwest's management is clearly sending a signal to the market
that the company's stock is undervalued at current levels," he said.

The sale of 22.22 million Qwest shares back to Qwest will leave BellSouth
with 52 million shares, or a 3% stake in Qwest.  BellSouth agreed to hold
those shares until Jan. 16, 2002, except for 11 million shares it can sell
after Feb. 16, 2001.

Qwest probably will not be the buyer if BellSouth decides to sell those 11
million shares, Mr. Nacchio said during a Jan. 16 conference call.  Qwest may
help BellSouth sell the shares to Qwest's independent pension fund, but Qwest
can't buy any more shares without running the risk of hurting its credit
rating, Mr. Nacchio suggested.

Qwest management consulted credit-rating agencies and decided $1 billion "was
a good number we could handle.  It wasn't going to put any burden on us," Mr.
Nacchio said.

Two credit-rating agencies agreed.  Qwest intends to fund the purchase by
issuing commercial paper, a short-term funding solution.  "The company has
adequate balance-sheet flexibility to absorb the additional debt," Standard &
Poor's said.  Moody's Investors Service said it was "comfortable that Qwest's
actions. . .are sensitive to the overall credit implications."

Despite the stock buyback, the relationship between the companies will
increase.  In addition to continuing its co-marketing agreement with Qwest
and using Qwest for long-haul transport, BellSouth will buy $250 million
worth of services from Qwest, paying   with Qwest shares.

Blaming Verizon for Bankruptcy, NorthPoint Plans Asset Auction

NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc., doesn't expect to emerge from
bankruptcy as an independent entity but has asked a bankruptcy court to allow
a "structured sale" of its assets.

"The purpose of our filing is to use the breathing room Chapter 11 provides
to sign an agreement with a financially sound strategic partner who is
interested in our world-class network," said Elizabeth A. Fetter, NorthPoint'
s president and chief executive officer, in a conference call with financial
analysts.

NorthPoint filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code
Jan. 16 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California.
The filing follows a financial slide for which NorthPoint largely blames
Verizon Communications, Inc.  In November 2000, Verizon canceled plans to
acquire 55% of NorthPoint and provide $350 million in financing (TR, Dec. 4,
2000).

NorthPoint has laid off workers, scaled back operations, and sold stakes in
joint ventures in Europe and Canada, but those moves apparently weren't
enough to keep the company solvent.  In conjunction with its bankruptcy
filing, the company obtained agreements for as much as $38 million in "
debtor-in-possession" financing to continue operations.

"The company's available cash only funds its operations for a few weeks,"
said Kenneth Hoexter, an analyst with Merrill Lynch & Co.  "Even with the
nearly $12 million in cash received through recent divestitures, we believe
that the company has virtually run out of additional funds to keep operations
running."

"The only surprise for most investors in this bankruptcy filing was that it
wasn't announced sooner given the critical funding situation at NorthPoint,"
Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. analyst Mark Kastan said in a Jan. 17 report.

"With NorthPoint's assets now officially on the block, look for a number of
telecom companies to express an interest," Mr. Kastan said.  Potential
bidders include McLeodUSA, Inc., XO Communications, Inc., and any
interexchange carrier that needs more local broadband infrastructure, Mr.
Kastan said.

NorthPoint's condition has raised new doubts about the other major "data
CLECs" (competitive local exchange carriers)-Rhythms NetConnections, Inc.,
and Covad Communications Group, Inc.-whose business models depend largely on
deployment of DSL (digital subscriber line) service.

"Although both Rhythms NetConnections and Covad Communications have enough
cash to last for several more quarters, we believe it will be extremely
difficult for either of these companies to obtain additional financing," Mr.
Kastan said.  "We expect significant scale-back initiatives-in addition to
those already announced-from both of them."  Covad already has taken steps to
conserve cash, and Rhythms announced similar steps last week (see separate
story).

Credit Suisse First Boston analyst Daniel P. Reingold noted that the downfall
of the data CLECs had left Bell companies and independent incumbent telcos
well positioned to attack the market for high-speed Internet access.

"A year ago investors had genuine fear that DSL CLECs, using the FCC's highly
discounted UNE [unbundled network elements] and line-sharing rates, would be
able to profitably take significant share" from Bell companies and
independent incumbent local exchange carriers, Mr. Reingold said in a Jan. 17
report.

"Now with NorthPoint in bankruptcy, Covad and Rhythms cutting back coverage
dramatically, AT&T [Corp.] and WorldCom [Inc.] nowhere in DSL, and Bell
companies ramping [up] DSL install rates, it is apparent the consumer
high-speed access market will be left to the cable [TV] and incumbent
telephone companies, and the small-business market to the latter," he said.

Qwest Touts Line-Sharing Pacts, Improved Service

Qwest Communications, Inc., has said it improved its service to end-user
customers and other carriers in 2000 in key areas-including those that have
come under fire from consumers and state regulators.

Qwest filled almost 98% of it service orders for 2000 on time, Afshin
Mohebbi, Qwest's president-worldwide operations, told reporters during a Jan.
15 conference call.  Ninety-five percent of local service repairs were
completed on time, Qwest's best performance in this category since 1996, he
said.  He also cited reductions in the percentage of customers whose service
was out for more than 24 hours and a decrease in "held or delayed" orders.

Last week, Qwest also unveiled permanent line-sharing agreements with
MULTIBAND Communications, Inc., New Edge Networks, NorthPoint Communications,
Inc., and Contact Communications.  Line-sharing agreements enable competitors
to use the high-frequency portion of the loop for data transmission while
Qwest continues to pr

Mike in the back office reminded me to tell everyone that ISO numbers need to
be put into the Oasis line in Enpower.  Since he does the losses manually
after the fact this will help him a lot.  Also, the link to the Ercot
intranet is attached below.  If you trade Ercot, please add it to your
favorites.  ISO messages, real time load display info, and a new real-time
ATC calculator matrix are all there.

You guys are doing a great job backfilling KCPL and moving power across the
tie when we have the transmission.  Sorry about the P&L and Enpower being
hairy when we do it.  As you've seen, however, when the spreads are there we
are printing money.

Be careful also when putting in deals with regards to what book they go in.
This morning there was a Cinergy wheel in the Ercot book.  It's easy to mess
up even for the veterns.  Richard "somehow" had a PJM financial deal in the
Ercot book this morning that just coincidentally lost over $2000.  I'm not
sure what comment to make on that one.

Thanks again guys, the Ercot book is up over $160K for the month due in part
to the job you guys are doing.  If you work the phones hard in Ercot, there
are always people to get between for solid spreads.

Late,

We finally had a conversation with Bill Garner at Petrie Parkman late
Wednesday afternoon, 2/21/01.  Tom Brown representatives are not discussing
the status of the WEP acquisition with any entities.
Bill informed us that they are in negotiations with a single entity for the
entire Wildhorse Package as included in the data room plus some additional
Colorado assets that were not included in the package.  Bill also informed
us (and the reason he returned our call) is that he indicated he believes
the entity would be "friendly" to Crescendo  and has expressed interest (to
them) in "working with us" on our project and plans.  We reminded him that
there are still issues with our existing contract that need to be
expediently resolved, and we aren't going to wait 6 months to resolve these
issues.  He assured us that Tom Brown is very aware of contractual issues.
He indicated that the entity wanted to contact Crescendo now (before
execution of the PSA), but TBI insists on working through PSA issues before
contact with Crescendo.  A PSA review meeting is scheduled for next week.
Bill said he would make introductions for us as soon as the PSA is executed.
Bill also informed us that it was TBI management that made the decision to
sell all the assets instead of breaking up, even if breaking up brought a
higher sale price.

Becky --
Can you please find out (a) details about the emergency expansion on Kern
River and (b) key Firm Shippers on Kern River, Mojave, PGT?
Philip Allen called me this morning and asked about our ability to "get a
read" on the potential for other Firm Shippers on Kern River to oppose this
expansion.  Can we quietly reach out to our industry contacts (other Govt
Affairs shops) to get their opinions?
His concern is primarily about Kern expanding into CA will limit other Firm
Shippers given the limitations on the SoCal system [Jeff, give me a call to
see how this plays in CA].
While we are not a Firm Shipper (and we probably don't want to get directly
in front of this - Enron fights expansion), how will FERC and its Staff look
at this issue [Donna & Leslie}?
Let's try and have the info and a call on Thursday at 4pm Houston time to get
back to him afterwards.

The project has now decided to own and separately contract for the construction of the 40 mile lateral pipeline to connect TW (and others) to the project site near Wickieup, AZ.

Kirk has requested that TW provide an estimate for the cost of the interconnect and meter station only (with appropriate control devices, flow, pressure, etc.).  When I reminded Kirk that EPNG probably delivers at a pressure 150 psig lower than TW's, he asked that we include a pressure letdown device in our estimate in order to be able to commingle with EPNG.

Eric, since we have the vast majority of this work has already been done by Earl and Ron, I told him we could probably get back to him with an estimate by early-mid next week.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Please contact Kristin Walsh (x39510) or Robert Johnston (x39934) for further clarification.

Executive Summary:

Utility bankruptcy appears increasingly likely next week unless the state can clear three hurdles- agreement on payback for the bailout, rate increases, and further short-term funding for DWR purchases of power.
Disagreement persists between Gov. Davis and Democrats in the legislature on how the state should be paid back for its bailout of the utilities.  The split is over a stock warrant plan versus state ownership of utility transmission assets.
The economics of the long-term contracts appear to show that rate hikes are unavoidable because of the need to amortize the undercollected rates of the utilities during the recent rate freeze period.
Air Quality Management District regulations are under review, but offer limited scope for providing additional generation capacity.
Legislature Democrats are feeling intense pressure from the left-wing consumer groups and are being forced to at least slow, if not stop, Davis's bailout and rate hike plans.  Senator Burton's eminent domain threats against generators, which reflect this pressure, are of little significance.


1.	Bankruptcy Outlook Rising Once Again

A deal to finalize a debt workout continues to be just beyond the reach of the state, the utilities, and their creditors, with time running out on the debt forbearance arrangement set to expire on Tuesday.

SoCal Edison and PG&E are not paying any of their bills except for payroll.  They are working very hard to keep cash on-hand, and have indicated that they feel that they are very close to an involuntary bankruptcy filing.  Once this filing occurs, they will have 50 days until either the bankruptcy court accepts the filing or the utilities file a voluntary bankruptcy.

Opinion within the assembly is divided with respect to the outlook for bankruptcy.  Assemblyman Keeley told our source that a filing is likely, but that everything will be resolved during that 50-day period.  Senator John Burton "is in no hurry" to reach a deal with the utilities, as he believes that the State of  California is in a good position to "strong-arm" the utilities.  Burton currently does not intend to cede to the utilities so that they can avoid bankruptcy.   The Senator stated, "bankruptcy would be bad, but not the worst thing possible."  He intends to stick to his position.  Senator Burton also dismissed Governor Davis' end-of-week deadline for striking a deal with the utilities.

Still, bankruptcy can be avoided if a last-minute deal can be struck Monday on:
what the state receives in return for the bailout
the scope of rate hikes (a federal court is expected to rule on the PG&E/SoCal v. CPUC rate undercollection case Monday)
additional financing is made available to the DWR to buy more power until the revenue bonds can be issued in May.

There is a possibility that significant progress on these issues could lead to a further extension of creditor forbearance.  However, the negative tone taken by Standard & Poors and others concerning delays in the legislature suggest that further forbearance will difficult to achieve.  The previous forbearance period was only achieved via a high-level Washington summit which does not appear likely to happen this weekend.

Additional financing for DWR will not be automatically approved by the legislature.  The non-energy expenditures of the California government are now at risk, as there is not yet a rate structure in place to recover the costs being expended on power from the General Fund.

2.	State to Take 2/3 of Utility Debt

While the state seems to have succeeded in forcing the utility parents to eat close to one third of the $12 billion debt, a final deal has been held up on two fronts.  First, it is still unclear what the state will get in return for the utility debt.  It is possible that there will be a mix of stock warrants and/or transmission assets.  A takeover of the transmission assets seems more likely than a takeover of the hydro assets.  The value of these assets still has not been settled.  Second, while the state will be on the hook for $9 billion, it is not clear what mixture of rate hikes and revenue bonds will be used to recover the cost of the bailout.  Finally, expect Davis and other California politicians to work to minimize rate hikes (although the Edison/PG&E v. CPUC case on Monday is likely to force their hand here) and to do everything possible to avoid the appearance of a bailout.  The tangible transmission assets are more politically attractive than the nebulous stock warrants.

No price has been set at which the State would purchase the utilities' transmission assets, which are currently valued at approximately $7-$8 billion.  All of the proceeds though cannot be used to pay off the utilities' debts, as some of the money would go to existing bondholders.  However, IPP sources advise that there is already a bid on the table for these transmission assets that is higher than what the state would offer.

3.	Long-Term Contracts

As noted by the governor in his announcement Tuesday, only 500 MW of the 5,000 MW of power contracted for can come on-line immediately.  Much of the remainder reportedly was contracted in long-term purchases from suppliers who are building power plants.  Some of this will come on-line in approximately two years.

Assemblyman Keeley expressed frustration that he has received a "tablet from on high" from Governor Davis that there must not be a rate increase.  This means that the state must acquire power, not from internal sources or from the market, but through long-term contracts at 7.39 cents/kwh.  This allows 1.213 cents to amortize SoCal Edison's undercollection from the recent rate freeze period.  (The number is slightly different for PG&E.)  This assumption is based on a natural gas price of $7.90 in 2001 and $5.15 in 2005, and an efficiency heating rate of 10,000 - 12,000 in 2001 and 7,200 in 2005.

These numbers were quoted to industry sources, who felt they were unrealistic.  These sources quoted the 2001 price of natural gas as $9.00 - $9.50.  The sources agreed with Keeley's number for the 2001 efficiency heating rate, but they felt that 7,200 in 2005 was very optimistic unless an enormous amount of new generation capacity comes on line.

According to Keeley's numbers and assuming the filed rate case is settled at $7 billion rather than $12 billion, it would take 5 to 6 years to amortize all of the utility undercollection.  A settlement to this case will need to be reached so that the State can figure out how much to charge for power in order to amortize the undercollection.  However, since Assemblyman Keeley's numbers are unrealistic, a rate increase will be necessary.

4.	Air Quality District Exemptions

There have been a few bills introduced to provide exemptions from AQMD (Air Quality Management District) regulations -- AB 20X, AB 28X, AB 31X. Also, Republicans have been asking the Governor to lift the environmental regulations and immediately site the facility in San Jose that was denied by the local government.

Currently there is no contemplation of loosening the AQMD compliance restrictions.  The legislature will not allow "dirtier" plants to
come on-line.  However, there might be a change in the means of implementation in southern California by moving away from the
use of credits (this apparently drives up the cost of gas-fired power).

5.	Democratic Moderates Pressured by Consumer Advocates

The moderate left (Sen. Burton, the PUC, consumer activists) is afraid of Harvey Rosenfield and his consumers movement.  This is not just because of his initiative.  More important from their perspective, his initiative puts him and the far left in a position to challenge and defeat the moderates in the next election.  Thus, Democrats in the legislature will feel pressured to distance themselves from Davis and slow down any further rate increases or bailout.

6. 	Eminent Domain Would Have A Limited Effect

The threats by Burton to seize generation assets to insure continued power supply are limited.  They only apply to California suppliers.  A
federal order would be needed to seize assets from out-of-state suppliers. There are also Canadian suppliers (such as BC Hydro) who are essentially untouchable.

7.	Smaller IPPs Feeling the Squeeze

Many of the smaller IPPs, which account for approximately 2500 MW of production, appear to be within a few days of running out of cash.
AB 1X may be amended, possibly sometime this week, to give the smaller producers credit support.

Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)
2/28/1 18:56 (New York)
Davis Wants Generators to Accept Less Than Owed (Update2)
(Adds names of California generators in fifth paragraph, and
Reliant comment in sixth.)
New York, Feb. 28 (Bloomberg) -- California Governor Gray
Davis said he intends to ask power generators to accept partial
payment for power sold to the state's cash-strapped utilities this
summer and winter, Wall Street analysts who attended a closed-door
meeting with the governor said.
``It looks like the people he wants sharing the pain are the
companies generating power sold to utilities,'' said Kevin Boone,
a bond analyst with Bear, Stearns & Co. who attended the meeting
in New York. ``He wants to force them to take cents on the dollar.
That seems to be what his initial proposal will be.''
PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, and Edison
International's Southern California Edison, the state's largest
utilities, are near bankruptcy after accumulating more than $12
billion in debt buying power from generators at soaring prices.
Regulators have not let the utilities pass on most of their power-
buying debt to consumers.
Davis said some generators have approached him with offers to
accept less than full payment, said Michael Worms, a utility
analyst with Gerard Klauer Mattison & Co. Davis spoke to about 35
analysts from Wall Street and energy-research firms in New York in
a meeting that was criticized by investors and analysts who were
not allowed to attend.
No Names Mentioned
Davis didn't specify which companies came to him with partial-
payment proposals, analysts said. Duke Energy Corp., Calpine
Corp., Willams Cos., Dynegy Inc. and Reliant Energy Inc. are among
the biggest suppliers of electricity to California utilities.
``I'm not aware of him talking to anyone at Duke about
forgiveness,'' Duke Energy spokesman Tom Williams said.
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said Davis's proposal
``doesn't really come as a surprise'' because politicians in
Sacramento, the capital of California, have been discussing the
idea for weeks. Reliant has opposed anything other than full
payment of its debts.
``Williams fully expects to be paid the money that is owed
us,'' spokeswoman Paula Hall-Collins said. ``We have worked in
very good faith with the state, selling voluntarily into the
market, negotiating with them for long-term contracts and working
with them to solve the problem.''
Enron Corp., an energy trader that has set aside unspecified
reserve for possible losses in California, has not been approached
about debt forgiveness, said Karen Denne, a company spokeswoman.
``This proposal. . . is news to us,'' and does not address
the immediate problem of electricity shortages in California this
summer, Denne said. Industry analysts say California, which has
already had scattered blackouts this winter, will face more this
summer when power demand surges.
Buying the Grid
Davis said at the meeting that negotiations to buy PG&E
Corp.'s power transmission system may take another 30 days, though
he was optimistic an agreement could be reached within two weeks,
analysts said. He offered few other specifics on the PG&E talks,
said Steve Fetter, group managing director of global power for
Fitch Inc.
State officials are trying to reach agreement with PG&E and
Edison, as well as with Sempra Energy, to buy their transmission
lines as part of a plan to help them pay debt and borrow money at
low interest rates to avoid bankruptcy. A tentative agreement to
buy Edison's lines for $2.76 billion was reached last week. Talks
with Sempra are continuing.
The governor said he was optimistic an agreement with PG&E
could be reached in two weeks, but negotiations could drag on
longer, Fetter said.
``We are making progress,'' Davis said at a news conference
after the analysts meeting at the Cornell Club on the east side of
Manhattan. ``We are close to a final agreement with (Edison) and
relatively close with Sempra.''
The governor told analysts he's confident he can get a
utility rescue plan that doesn't require an immediate rate
increase, but Davis did say that rate increases are going to be
needed at some unspecified time in the future, Fetter said.
Davis said he wasn't sure if he resolved all of analysts'
doubts about California's plans to save its utilities from
bankruptcy.
``He's in a hole and he's got a long way to go to get out of
it,'' said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Credit Suisse First
Boston who attended the meeting. ``We still don't have a final
solution in sight.''
Shares of San Francisco-based PG&E fell 9 cents to $13.96.
Rosemead, California-based Edison shares fell 4 cents to $14.90.
San Diego-based Sempra fell 16 cents to $22.15.

Good morning.  One of my contacts at RGA sent me a copy of a letter that went
to DOE Secretary Abraham this week, thanking him for his participation in the
WGA conference in Portland.  It stated, in part :
"We now believe it is imperative, given the importance of encouraging the
development of and investment in new plant construction, that you NOTextend
the Department of Energy orders requiring the sale of electricity and natural
gas, and a cap on those prices."
The general tone of the overall letter was that they want Davis to continue
fixing his own problem.   The letter was copied to Dick Cheney and Chairman
Hebert.  I'll send a copy along via fax later today.  The signing Governors
were:  Hull, Owens, Kempthorne, Martz, Guinn, Gary Johnson, Leavitt,
Geringer--all republicans.

Sue/Scott--as you know, Broadband Infastructure Coalition (BIC) met over
breakfast this morning in D.C. with Commisioner Joan Smith of Oregon and Alan
Thoms of Iowa, the chair and vice chair of the telecom committee.  Jim Prybil
of Level 3, Rick Wood of WIlliams, Michael Freedman of Global Crossing and I
were there on behalf of the coaliton.  The primary message that we delivered
was that there should not be any expansion of extortion by local
municiapalities for right of way access (that "just and reasonable costs"
were being interpreted very liberally by the league of cities and other folks
and that the true interpretation should be actual incurred costs) and that we
hoped NARUC and these commissioners could support our position and promote
positions that enhance our ability to expand infastructure without unfair
fees or costs.
Both Commissioners were sympathetic and supportive, but Ms. Smith in
particular indicated that the issue is generally outside of the their purview
and that the political realities of strongly wading into the issue would be
difficult for some COmmissioners on the committee (the city/muni/local
political clout either with the Administration that appoints the
commissioners or the electorate if commisioners are elected).  However, they
both suggested that the NARUC committee should consider having a session on
the issue, possibly at the summer NARUC meeting.  I spoke with Alan Thoms as
he left the breakfast, and he indicated that he thought a full day of
sessions covering this issue, poles and wires, as well as building access
would be very productive.  I expressed to him our interest in the building
access issue as well.
Rick Wood of Williams is going to take responsibility with the BIC for
interaction with this NARUC committee.  (I believe that Rick came from a
regulatory background at GTE).
I did not attend any of the NARUC telecom meetings, but I believe that Alison
was going to cover and will send out an update if there was anything of note
to report.
Paul--I copied you as a courtesy just so you knew that someone from Enron was
in front of one of your Oregon commissioners.

All---here's an update on what we've been doing with the Governors.  Should I
be putting Steve Kean on these email updates?
As you all know, there were several governors events over the past 3 to 4
days in Washington DC:
Paul and I met with Steve Reynolds from Wyoming Gov Geringer's office.  They
would like us to put forward the name of an Enron individual that could
participate in an Energy council that is being formed (actually commissioned
by the legislature) to study energy issues for the state.  Geringer would
also like to come to Houston to learn about our vision in moving from an
assets based to a market based entity.
We had contacted Scott Cealy (spelling) with Arizona Governor Hull's office
last week and  Paul sat with Gov Hull at the RGA dinner on Monday night and
had a chance to thank her for her  leadership in opposing price caps. Mr.
Cealy left me a voice mail this afternoon basically inviting us to come to
see them. I will schedule that meeting (boy that Paul must have been charming
at dinner!!!)
I sat with Gary Smith, political guy with Gov Kempthorne's office who
indicated that Kempthorne was scheduled to meet with Vice Pres Cheney on
Tuesday afternoon.  Gov Kitzhaber was also scheduled to attend the meeting
with Cheney, but there was speculation that he may not come.  I have not
confirmed the outcome of that meeting, but was invited by Mr. Smith to call
him once they get back to Idaho tommorrow.  I will place that call and see
what I can find out.  Mr. Racicot was going to get back to us on what he
found out from Kempthorne---has Linda or Rick heard from him?  I will be
continueing outreach with Gary Smith on as routine a basis is acceptable to
him.
We have committed to an RGA event in Aspen Colorado on March 30 that Governor
Owens is sponsoring.  Paul and I continue to keep in touch with Gov Owens
staff.  As most of you know from previous updates, Owens is strong in his
support against price caps and market based solutions.
At our meeting with Racicot on Monday in DC Paul requested some assistance
from him in setting up a meeting with Kitzhaber.  Linda--how do we want to
follow up on that request?
Rick and Paul met with Gov Gary Locke on Tuesday and while they disagreed
with Lockes position, the discussion was civil and at least left the door
open to future discussions.  Rick and Paul will manage this relationship for
now.
We have not has great success in meeting with Leavitt.  I will continue to
work on setting that up.  Guinn has also not been extremely receptive to
meeting with us and Paul and I will look at how/whether we continue to knock
on that door.  We are not actively looking to meet with Montana due to some
commercial reasons.
There are a number of other ongoing actions (WGA contacts, providing info,
etc), but the above update should give everybody the highlights.

I spoke with Marvin today, he has comments on the LOI.  David Hunt will
finally be available on Wednesday to work with Kay to address legal issues.
Bob Priest is recommending Enron to his board tonight.    Due to their peaker
deal with Aquilla, they have been unable to make progress on our LOI, so it
will not be presented at his board meeting Tuesday night.  He has them on
notice that special meeting may be called to execute the LOI as early as a
week from today.  He would like to be in agreement on the LOI issues by the
end of this week.

He has the following comments on the LOI:

page 4 paragraph 8, "negotiate" rather than "negotiates"
we need clarification on the mechanism by which Enron will recover
infrastructure costs.  He wants to make sure that Enron cost recovery is out
of our 40% and backed up by a guaranteed monthly minimum calculated as the
amoritized capital costs over the contract period.
he wants more detail on the $50k breakup fee.  What are the circumstances
that would precipitate a payout?
David Hunt and Kay Mann need to get together (he indicated that David has
been unavailable) to address the legal issues including limitation of
liability and arbitration such that they agree with Mississippi law.
he needs some specifics on the ancilliary services (load following,
regualtion, and reserves).

On the last issue, he indicated that this is the "deal maker/breaker."  He
offered that our competition indicated that their regulated side would be
providing those services.  He needs to know from Enron who we would contract
with to do it--"we can horse trade on the price later."  I indicated that we
have not given specifics to the market in searching for ancilliary services,
and were waiting on the LOI before we asked for proposals.  He wants
specifics--other than pricing--before he signs the LOI.


After talking with Ozzie and Lloyd, here is the game plan:

get the Entergy tariff and price the ancilliary services with Entergy as
the provider
find out who the high-load-factor IPPs are in the Mississippi area
put calls in to those IPPs as well as CLECO, LEPA, SMEPA, Cajun, Alabama
Electric Power Co-op, and Entergy and guage interest and potential pricing
for providing ancilliary services
we will need approximately 4 MW of regulation service, load following and
reserves.  We would send the signal and communicate with the ancilliary
service provider.
Once we have gathered some preliminary information, call Marvin on
Wednesday and let him know that we expect to go with Entergy during the first
60 days beginning May 1 and select/negotiate/contract with one of the above
for the balance of the contract.  In no case would the pricing be higher than
the entergy tariff rates.

I would like to have Christi and Lloyd available for the call to Marvin.

How does all this sound??

damage or defect and consulting with Seller as to how such damage will affect
the installation , operation, performance, reliability, efficiency, and
warranty of the damaged Equipment may either:
(i) reasonable determine that such damage or defect is such that the
preceding criteria is so adversely affected that Purchaser cannot accept
delivery of the damaged Equipment and declare that delivery has not occurred,
or
(ii) after taking into account such criteria and Seller's proposed plan for
correcting such damage or defect in accordance with Section 9.5, declare that
delivery has occurred: in the event Purchaser discovers such a damage or
defect, it shall notify Seller of such as soon as practical.
c) facts of the case, as we know them:
common carrier ship carrying the generator supposedly arrived in port of
houston approx. 14jul00.  i.e., that was the ship's estimated time of arrival
(eta).
westinghouse is claiming that delivery occurred on or about 23jul00.
enron representative (frank cervenka) went to CTSS (i.e., the westinghouse
facility here in houston) on friday, 21jul00 to inspect the combustion
turbine.  during that inspection, westinghouse employees informed him that
the generator had salt water damage at the port.  as a result, the following
monday, 24jul00, he visited the port of houston with the siemens-westinghouse
insurance adjustor and saw the damaged generator.  note - this was just a
cursory visit to verify that in fact the unit had been damaged.  the full
extent of the damage and impact on the project was not known at that time -
e.g., repair or replace were still viable options.
enron received formal notification (faxed letter) of the damaged generator on
approx. 18aug00.
enron has already made progress payments to siemens-westinghouse in the
amount of 95% of the contract value of the gas turbine and generator.
DDP, per incoterms 1990, means delivered duty paid.
Westinghouse, despite 2 prior requests from enron, has not provided copies of
the customs clearance documentation.  i.e., we don't know the exact date that
the generator cleared customs, or if it cleared customs.
title means ownership, but does not imply either risk of loss or care,
custody, and control.  with title comes both ownership and the responsibility
for payment of taxes.
d) info not known by enron:
when did ship come into port?
when did damage to generator occur?
when, or if, u.s. customs duties were paid?
f) info known by enron:
generator is a total loss, as determined by westinghouse.
per section 10.2.3 of contract, enron was not given the formal opportunity to
inspect the damaged generator until a month after it arrived in port.  as
recalled by matt tezyk, westinghouse was then advised by enron in writing
that the generator was rejected and that delivery had not occurred.
(author's note - matt to find cc of that letter).
g) enron's assertions are that:
DDP was not satisfied.  i.e., delivery of the generator did not occur in
accordance with the terms of the contract.
title (i.e., ownership) remains with siemens-westinghouse.
risk of loss remains with siemens-westinghouse.

Peter Mims is preparing a memo to me that will confirm our findings on the IP
issues based on the contracts we have reviewed and the meeting we had
yesterday.  I should get a copy of it today and will circulate it once it is
finalized.  I will also prepare a list of the contracts we have reviewed.  I
am still collecting a few agreements (Ganady Batrak's prior service agreement
and Bob Campbells agreement) and will also be collecting copies of our
agreements with Enron Net Works employees for review.
With respect to the NDA's, they have all been drafted and it is my
understanding that they were sent to our counterparties last week.  Oracle
has already signed an NDA and I have a copy if you would like to have it.  I
would suggest that before we have further conversations with Oracle that we
consider asking them to also sign a non-solicitation agreement with us.  The
NDA with Oracle is the only NDA that does not contain a non-solicitation
provision.
In order to facilitate getting the rest of NDA's signed as quickly as
possible, I would suggest that Rex ask each of his contacts for the name and
phone number of the legal counsel reviewing the agreement and I will give
them a call and find out if they have any issues that need to be resolved.
Obviously the i2 contract should be our priority.
FYI- I received a call from the contact at PriceWaterhouseCoopers and we will
send him a NDA directly.

These are always funny.  Thought you might enjoy them.

The long awaited Darwin  Natural Selection Awards - Criminal Category have
been released! These  awards are given each year to bestow upon that
individual, who through  isolation by incarceration, has done the most to
remove undesirable elements  from the human gene pool.

RUNNER-UP # 9 Yankton, South Dakota: A woman  was arrested at her stepson's
Boy Scout meeting. While watching a  policeman demonstrate his drug dog's
ability, the dog found a bag of  marijuana in her purse.

RUNNER-UP # 8 Colorado Springs: A guy walked  into a little corner store with
a shotgun and demanded all the cash from the  cash drawer. After the cashier
put the cash in a bag, the robber saw a  bottle of Scotch that he wanted
behind the counter on the shelf. He  told the cashier to put it in the bag
as
well, but he refused and said  "Because I don't believe you are over 21." The
robber said he was, but the  clerk still refused to give it to him because he
didn't believe him.  At this point the robber took his drivers license out
of
his wallet  and gave it to the clerk. The clerk looked it over, and agreed
that  the man was in fact over 21 and he put the Scotch in the bag.
The robber  then ran from the store with his loot. The cashier promptly
called the  police and gave the name and address of the robber that he got
off
the  license. They arrested the robber two hours later.

RUNNER-UP # 7 A  woman was reporting her car as stolen, and mentioned that
there was a car  phone in it. The policeman taking the report called the
phone and told  the guy that answered that he had read the ad in the
newspaper
and wanted to  buy the car. They arranged to meet, and the thief was
arrested.

RUNNER-UP # 6 San Francisco: A man, wanting to rob a downtown Bank of
America, walked into the branch and wrote "this iz a stikkup. Put all  your
muny in this bag." While standing in line, waiting to give his note to  the
teller, he began to worry that someone had seen him write the note and  might
call the police before he reached the teller window.
So he left  the Bank of America and crossed the street to Wells Fargo.
After waiting a  few minutes in line, he handed his note to the Wells Fargo
teller. She  read it and, surmising from his spelling errors that he was not
the  brightest light in the harbor, told him that she could not accept his
stickup note because it was written on a Bank of America deposit slip and
that he would either have to fill out a Wells Fargo deposit slip or go back
to Bank of America. Looking somewhat defeated, the man said "OK"
and left. The Wells Fargo teller then called the police who arrested  the
man
a few minutes later, as he was waiting in line back at Bank of  America.

RUNNER-UP # 5 From England: A motorist was unknowingly caught  in an
automated
speed trap that measured his speed using radar and  photographed his car. He
later received in the mail a ticket for 40  Pounds and a photo of his car.
Instead of payment, he sent the police  department a photograph of 40 pounds.

Several days later, he received  a letter from the police that contained
another picture ...of handcuffs.  The motorist promptly sent the money for
the fine.

RUNNER-UP #  4 Drug Possession Defendant Christopher Jansen, on trial in
March
in  Pontiac, Michigan, said he had been searched without a warrant. The
prosecutor said the officer didn't need a warrant because a "bulge" in
Christopher's jacket could have been a gun. "Nonsense," said  Christopher,
who happened to be wearing the same jacket that day in court.  He handed it
over so the judge could see it. The judge  discovered a packet of cocaine in
the pocket and laughed so hard he required  a five minute recess to compose
himself.

RUNNER-UP # 3 Oklahoma  City: Dennis Newton was on trial for the armed
robbery
of a convenience  store in district court when he fired his lawyer.
Assistant District  Attorney Larry Jones said Newton, 47, was doing a fair
job
of defending  himself until the store manager testified that Newton was the
robber.  Newton jumped up, accused the woman of lying and then said, "I
should  of blown your (expletive) head off." The defendant paused, then
quickly  added, "If I'd been the one that was there." The jury took 20
minutes
to  convict Newton and recommended a 30-year sentence.

RUNNER-UP # 2  Detroit: R.C. Gaitlan, 21, walked up to two patrol officers
who were  showing their squad car computer felon-location equipment to
children in a  Detroit neighborhood. When he asked how the system worked,
the
officer  asked him for identification. Gaitlan gave them his driver's
license,  they entered it into the computer, and moments later they arrested
Gaitlan  because information on the screen showed Gaitlan was wanted for a
two-year-old armed robbery in St. Louis, Missouri.

RUNNER-UP #  1 Another from Detroit: A pair of Michigan robbers entered a
record shop  nervously waving revolvers. The first one shouted, "Nobody
move!" When  his partner moved, the startled first bandit shot him.

THE WINNER A  Charlotte, NC, man having purchased a case of very rare, very
expensive  cigars, insured them against fire among other things. Within a
month,  having smoked his entire stockpile of cigars and without having made
even  his first premium payment on the policy, the man filed a claim against
the  insurance company. In his claim, the man stated the cigars were lost
"in
a series of small fires." The insurance company refused to pay, citing the
obvious reason that the man had consumed the cigars in the normal fashion.
The man sued.... and won.
In delivering the ruling the  judge agreeing that the claim was frivolous,
stated nevertheless that the  man held a policy from the company in which it
had warranted that the cigars  were insurable and also guaranteed that it
would insure against fire,  without defining what it considered to be
"unacceptable fire," and was  obligated to pay the claim. Rather than endure
a lengthy and costly  appeal process the insurance company accepted the
ruling
and paid the man  $15,000 for the rare cigars he lost in "the fires." After
the man cashed the  check, however, the company had him arrested on 24 counts
of arson.  With his own insurance claim and testimony from the previous
case
being used against him, the man was convicted of intentionally burning his
insured property and sentenced to 24 months in jail and a $24,000 fine.

As many of you know, I ran the Las Vegas Marathon this past weekend.  The
race (and the weekend) was one of the best experiences of my life.  My only
goal was to have fun and complete the marathon without re-injurying my
hamstring.  First the bad news.  The first 8 miles was not comprised of
rolling hills as I had once thought.  Instead, it was a gradual uphill
climb . . . for 8-9 miles.  Once we hit the downhill, there was a nasty
headwind that really slowed you down.  Can't imagine how fast it would have
been absent the head wind.  Finally, the temperature swing was between low
40s (start) to 70s (finish).

Now that's out of the way, the people running it were AMAZING.  Everyone
was pushing the person next to him and when one person could push ahead,
everyone else cheered him/her on, particularly at the finish.  Can't tell
you how many guys told me to get moving because they knew I had more in me.
At mile 23, I was beginning to feel the effect of the heat and a more
experienced marathoner ran by me noticing that I had stopped to eat a
banana and said "GET MOVING."  I caught up to him and thanked him as I
passed.  I ran the last 3.2 miles at a 7:30 (or so) pace, largely due to
him.  I felt really strong (except for the fatigue at mile 23) and could
have run much faster.  I opted early on to stick to a conservative running
plan.  If I got a PR, great.  Most important was to finish this marathon
and to keep running without pain.  It takes less time to improve your
running (to attain that PR) than it does to come back from an injury.  And
so I have learned . . .

Sorry this is so long.  It was such a GREAT experience that I know you all
understand (as fellow athletes or as coaches) so I wanted to share.  Thanks
again for all of your advice.  I followed it to the letter (even the most
absurd).  It was much appreciated.  For those who are traveling to Austin
in two weeks, I'll see you there!

Christine

Rod,

I mentioned to you that we had met with the Enron SAP team several weeks ago to discuss pros and cons of Azurix Corp. moving to SAP.  Our main reason for exploring this was the fact that key functions in closing our Oracle books, due to attrition, were only known by one employee.  This employee is a manager (Virginia Krobot), and the other remaining permanent accounting staff is an accounting clerk and two A/P people.  There are some parts of the closing that are only being performed by AccountTemps personnel.  We are transitioning these to Azurix employees as we can.

I spoke today to Mark Schmidt with the SAP team.  I told him before we moved any further on exploring this option, I thought we should get your thoughts.

If we lose the manager in our group we will have difficulty closing the books.  As you can imagine, Azurix does not have much attractiveness to potential employees to supplement our current staff, and given the direction we are heading, it doesn't make sense to recruit new staff.  In addition, a conversion will not come cheap, although the SAP team was not planning on a full implementation.  They used the term "SAP trial balance company."

We could save the cost of implementation if you believe that within your group, we could get an accounting senior specialist or manager who could give me assistance with Oracle, should Virginia resign.  Virginia will give us enough notice that we could have myself and someone from your group crash learn the closing functions.

Let me know if you think we should proceed looking at SAP.

Thanks -- Kenny

TAKE A STROLL


If you are old enough . . . take a stroll with me . . . close your eyes

before SEGA or Super Nintendo . Going out to eat and shopping?  way back . . .

I'm talking about hide and go seek at dusk. Sitting on the porch, Simon
Says, Kick the Can, Red light - Green light. Lunch boxes with a
thermos... chocolate milk, going home for lunch, penny candy from the store,
hopscotch, butterscotch, skates with keys, single speed bikes, cards on your
spokes for a motor, Jacks, Mother May I?

Hula Hoops and sunflower seeds, Whist and Old Maid and Crazy Eights, wax
lips and mustaches, Mary Janes, turning in bottles for candy money,
saddle shoes and Coke bottles with the names of cities on the bottom, running
through the sprinkler, circle pins, bobby pins, Mickey Mouse Club, Rocky
& Bullwinkle, Fran & Ollie, Spin & Marty ....all in black & white.

When around the corner seemed far away, and going downtown seemed like
going somewhere. Bedtime, climbing trees, making forts . . . backyard shows,
lemonade stands, Cops and Robbers, Cowboys and Indians, sitting' on the
curb, staring at clouds, jumping down the steps, jumping on the bed,
pillow fights, getting "company," ribbon candy, angel hair on the Christmas
tree, Jackie Gleason, white gloves, walking to church, walking to the movie
theater, being tickled to death, running till you were out of breath,
laughing so hard that your stomach hurt, being tired from playing'
. ...Remember that?

Not stepping' on a crack or you'll break your mother's back . . . paper
chains at Christmas, silhouettes of Lincoln and Washington. . the smell
of paste in school and Evening in Paris.  What about the girl that had the
big bubbly handwriting, who dotted her "i's" with hearts? The Stroll,
popcorn balls, & sock hops. Remember when there were two types of sneakers
for girls and boys (Keds & PF Flyer) and the only time you wore them at
school was for "gym." And the girls had those ugly uniforms? Taking the
school bus everywhere.

When it took five minutes for the TV to warm up. When nearly everyone's
Mom was at home when the kids got home from school. When nobody owned a
purebred dog. When a quarter was a decent allowance, and another quarter,
a huge bonus. When you'd reach into a muddy gutter for a penny.  When your
Mom wore nylons that came in two pieces. When all of your male teachers wore
neckties and female teachers had their hair done, everyday and wore high heels?
When you pressed and kneaded the color button into the margarine to give it
color.

When you got your windshield cleaned, oil checked, and gas pumped,
without asking, all for free, every time. And, you didn't pay for air. And,
you got trading stamps to boot!  When everyone had a fixer upper car and was
proud of it.  When laundry detergent had free glasses, dishes or towels hidden
inside the box. When any parent could discipline any kid, or feed him or
use him to carry groceries, and nobody, not even the kid, thought a thing of
it. When it was considered a great privilege to be taken out to dinner at a
real restaurant with your parents.

When they threatened to keep kids back a grade if they failed, and did!
When the worst thing you could do at school was smoke in the bathrooms,
flunk a test or chew gum. And the prom was in the auditorium and we
Danced to an orchestra, and all the girls wore pastel gowns and the boys
wore suits for the first time and we stayed out all night.

When a '57 Chevy was everyone's dream car . . . to cruise, peel out, lay
rubber or watch submarine races, and people went steady and girls wore a
class ring with an inch of wrapped dental floss or yarn coated with
pastel frost nail polish so it would fit her finger.

And no one ever asked where the car keys were 'cause they were always in
the car, in the ignition, and the doors were never locked. And you got in
big trouble if you accidentally locked the doors at home, since no one ever
had a key.

Remember lying on your back on the grass with your friends and saying
things like "That cloud looks like a . . . " And playing baseball with no
adults to help kids with the rules of the game. Back then; baseball was not a
psychological group learning experience-it was a game.

Remember when stuff from the store came without safety caps and hermetic
seals 'cause no one had yet tried to poison a perfect stranger.  And
...with all our progress . . don't you just wish, just once, you could
Slip back in time and savor the slower pace . . . and share it with the
children of today . . .

So send this on to someone who can still remember Nancy Drew, The Hardy
Boys, Laurel & Hardy, Howdy Doody and The Peanut Gallery, The Lone
Ranger, The Shadow Knows, Nellie Belle, Roy and Dale, Trigger and Buttermilk
...as well as the sound of a reel mower on Saturday morning, and summers
filled with bike rides, playing in cowboy land, baseball games, bowling and
visits to the pool . . .  and eating Kool-Aid powder with sugar.

When being sent to the principal's office was nothing compared to the
fate that awaited a misbehaving student at home. Basically, we were in fear
for our lives, but it wasn't because of drive by shootings, drugs, gangs,
etc. Our parents and grandparents were a much bigger threat! But we all
survived because their love was greater than the threat.

Didn't that feel good, just to go back and say, "Yeah, I remember
that!!!!!! >>

1.	Bankruptcy An Increasingly Attractive Option for Davis

Despite the fact that the lights are on and the snowpack is approaching normal levels after a month of torrential storms, back at the poker table in Sacramento the situation continues to drift toward bankruptcy. Indeed, almost any reading of Governor Gray Davis's political situation after the shock LA Federal Court ruling makes forcing the utilities into bankruptcy his best bet. At least one of the three major power generators (PG&E) seems to agree that bankruptcy is better than cutting the deal on the table now, particularly after yesterday's FERC ruling that it is okay for the company to shift assets around to protect them in case of bankruptcy.

2.	Davis Wants To Keep Hope Alive Until Analyst Meetings Next Week

Today is crucial in determining the exact odds of a bankruptcy since Davis wants to cut a deal if possible before heading off to lead the National Governor's Association and meet with Wall Street analysts Tuesday and Wednesday. In fact, Davis's desire to have something definitive to say next week is the only reason to believe that bankruptcy can be avoided in California. According to talks with all sides, Davis has offered to buy the electricity grid from the three largest power producers (PG&E, SoCal Edison and San Diego) for something like $7 billion that they could use to pay off most of the money they owe to suppliers and creditors outside their own corporate shells.

But the questions is why the utilities would want the deal that appears to be on offer and that leaves many people on both sides of the table wondering whether Davis actually wants a deal or an excuse to get back to a situation where he has court-ordered cover to raise electricity rates that he knows are necessary, but politically difficult. According to key Sacramento officials, "Confidence continues to wane in Davis' ability to do this. The plain fact is the stick he's carrying isn't awfully big." Adds another: "The key people here just think the utilities are playing him. Either they're playing him, or he's going to roll on the price, he's going to pay double what the transmission assets are worth. The utilities got away with the same kind of thing before, in 1996 of course." Davis is more astute than that, and a bankruptcy judge could yet be the political cover for a resolution that has been lacking since the utilities lost their court case in Los Angeles.

3.	Little Support for Transmission Assets Deal

The transmission assets deal doesn't look attractive for anyone.
Davis has no particular affinity for it, having adopted State Senator Burton's proposal when his own preferred equity warrants idea began to fade.
The legislature is wary of more state involvement in the power industry, and concerned about the vast investment needed in the network.
The utilities -- PG&E in particular don't want to sell.

4.	Accounting Ambiguities Appear; State Offers Only Tepid Support for Bond Scheme

"There are also more and more issues quietly emerging about utility accounting methods which the audits didn't pick up" says one California official. "The way they calculate depreciation is very strange. If the accounts were done on a proper GAAP basis instead of some kind of FERC basis they would look different." Even if the deal goes through, the financing could be difficult and very expensive. The state has definitively ruled out putting the full faith and credit of the state of California behind the proposed bonds. State Treasurer Angelides has also been informed it is unlikely they'd qualify for tax-exempt status.

5.	Small IPP Players Furious

And while the big players talk, there is increasing nervousness among small independent and alternative generators. The small companies have been the biggest losers so far -- their representative, Jan Smutny-Jones, was tossed off the Board of the California ISO, and the closing of the California PX deprives them of the main marketing channel for their power. The CEOs of large companies like Dynegy and Reliant are talking to Davis on a daily basis, but the small companies are out of the loop. They also lack the financial resources and diversity of income streams to resist problems for long. Large companies and the major bank creditors are also aware of the potential political and relationship risks across the US if they get cast in the role of villain in California. For the small companies, however, it is a matter of survival. Some legislators in Sacramento are operating under the assumption that it would take a creditor committee of the large generators to force bankruptcy. Not so. All it takes is three creditors owed at least $11,000 each to apply for bankruptcy. Two small companies, Cal Energy and Ridgewood Power, are already resorting to the courts to try to press for payment.

If bankruptcy is triggered, there is immense uncertainty about what would happen. No major player we talk to is confident they can predict the outcome, especially after the shock of Judge Lew's unexpected ruling in Los Angeles. It is likely that the issues would have to be decided ultimately by the State Supreme Court. FERC and the Federal government could also be ensnared as writs fly. But to many of the players, that uncertain mess following bankruptcy looks better than certain loss in a bad deal.

written comments back from him today with not only the same warranty wording,
but some additional warranty language in Part III.  These changes would be
added to Section 14.1.2 Warranty Clarifications in the contract.

Please review this Change Order and let me know if we can live with these
warranty provisions.  Otherwise, we will need to talk directly to Jeff's
attorney and commercial people to get it resolved.  Please also provide me
with any additional comments so that I may route this Change Order for
execution.

Brian, is there an EECC attorney that needs to review this Change Order as
well.  Please advise.

Thanks

I spoke to Choi Lee today.  It is hard for me to remain professional with him
as his arrogance and illogic is very frustrating, but our discussion was very
cordial.  He indicated that Enron has not brought forth any proposal of
substance.  This apprarently means we have not offered them energy at below
market prices.  I indicated that should he find some of that energy in the
"$50 - $60" range to give me a call as we would be willing to buy in the "70s
and the 80s."  I was not able to learn when he would be in the market to buy,
but I encouraged him to give me a call if he wanted a price quote.  I don't
have much confidence that he would call even if he was buying.  I will leave
it up to him to call rather than make this a priority to chase as the
opportunities with PD seem to be limited.  If they do need energy I expect
they will keep the term short and shop it pretty hard.  There mining
operation plans seem tenuous and they think prices are going to fall.  With
APS and Salt River out there in the shorter duration markets we wouldn't make
much money anyway.

Please do not hesitate to call if the situation changes and you need a
electricy price quote for a structure you are working on.

Thanks!

Tyrell,  I have made some revisions to the latest drafts of  the letter
agreement and your cover letter.  Please review.  As I noted earlier, Barry
indicated he had some language that he wanted to revise concerning the mark
to market.  I have not been able to contact him yet.  So unless Mark and
Barry have talked, probably need to hold these until you or I hear from Barry.
Also, if we are going to do any of these transaction with a Canadian party,
Peter Keohane and Eric Ledain need to comment on this form.  I have sent them
an earlier version and I am copying them here.
I will be in a meeting until about 3:30 pm central and will be available
after that.
I again want to reiterate, that if the assignment takes place after the firm
transport agreements are signed, Kern could require the assignment to be done
via the capacity release bidding procedures of their tariff.  I noticed that
one of the packages is less than 1 year in term.  This means it could also be
bid up in excess of max rate.  Anything over 1 year could only be bid to max
rate.    We may want to add a provision that to the extent the capacity is
assigned via capacity release and it is bid up beyond max rate, ENA will have
no obilgation to take the capacity and make the mark to market payment.
Probably need to discuss this with Mark.

obtain this acreage.  Per the right of way, Coles Levee Ecosystem Preserve

Aera, who manages the ecosystem, and tell him we want to negotiate a purchase
of 29 acres?  He should at least be able to tell you if there is acreage
available, and for how much.  (Also, Aera has a standard contract for this,
which you can send to me if you are able to strike a deal for the acreage.)
Randi McCormick can provide additional technical assistance with this if you

Of course, we also need to acquire acreage for the Rogas project, but I'd

reimbursement from Koch for this BLM acreage.

Hey!

I had along talk with Joel at Cargill today and discussed future business
opportunities with them. As everybody that worked this weekend knows Cargill
has been buying from EL PASO at way above market all Saturday and Sunday.
They are taking this power to MARKETPLACE where LA Trannie is taking it to
NOB S/N. They are selling this power to utilities in the NW for a low price.
They do no do to much business in the West and don't have our knowledge and
connections. I told Joel that we would be very interested in buying this from
him at a competitive price.

Whoever works Monday day needs to set up a BPA Account for LADWP - SNO
account on the DC with Enron paying everything.

I also discussed the posibility of us selling them power at MEAD. They would
not want the 7MW scraps from LV, but are very interested in the LV 50MW
pieces from 11-16. This could be a good way of selling LV at a very good
price.

I do believe they have this trannie all month and this could be a really
sweat deal for us. So lets be "fair" to these guys as I am sure once we get
to know them there are other things we can do with them.

Cargill Telephone# 952-984-3865.

Before we are certain who is leaving and who is staying it might not be the
best idea to talk to loud about this as we do not necessarily want this to be
known to everybody.

ON THE GRID OR OFF THE GRID
Bigger Is Better
An interstate electricity highway could leverage economies of scale to keep
the lights on Burton A. Weisbrod, Glen E. Weisbrod
Sunday,February 25, 2001
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle

C177059.DTL
WE COULD HAVE left it to the states. When the Interstate Highway System was
proposed nearly 50 years ago, we could have said, "Leave it to each state to
decide on its roads and to pay for them, or leave it to private enterprise to
build toll roads wherever it is profitable." Fortunately, we didn't.
Today, vehicles can travel throughout the country on a system of integrated
high-capacity roads that crisscross the nation. There are many differences
between the flow of cars or trucks and the flow of electricity. But just as
the Interstate Highway System ushered in a new era of easier movement of
people and goods across the states, allowing enormous economic and social
gains, so, too, do we now need to overcome the obstacles to the easy flow of
power across state lines.
Many forces are at work contributing to California's electricity crises, and
power shortages in other parts of the country also are quite possible. The
growth of population and industry in California has expanded demand for
electricity. Legislative constraints, reflecting environmental protection and
other concerns, have discouraged construction of electricity-generating
plants.
Periodic shutdowns of generation plants for maintenance have caused short-
term power shortages. And, in an oddity of California law, the prices that
power producers can charge distributors are deregulated, while the prices
that those distributors can charge consumers are regulated and restricted.
But largely missing from the debate of what can be done to balance supply and
demand is discussion of an effective national power grid that would permit
substantial amounts of electricity to flow, as highway traffic does, from one
state to another.
Interstate transmission connections do exist now, but are limited in
capacity. They were primarily designed to meet temporary needs associated
with local power emergencies, not for sustained use. If those interstate
lines were upgraded to greater capacity, then we could move toward actually
creating a national power grid.
An effective national power grid could result in far more competition among
producers of electric power across the nation, and far more options to meet
demand in any local area. No state or region would need to depend simply on a
small number of generating producers within its borders, and the increased
number of interstate competitors would bring greater assurance of supply and
lower prices.
The underlying problem is basically one of incentives. With the maze of
state, and federal regulations on the production, distribution and pricing of
electricity, there is great risk and little incentive for private
construction of costly transmission lines that cross multiple state borders.
Imagine a power plant in state A, but near state B, with that plant
occasionally having excess production capacity. There is no market for the
power in state B, but there is demand for it in state C, which is adjacent to
it. In a smoothly functioning, efficient, power transmission system, power
would move from the generating plant in state A, across the border for use in
state B, thereby permitting deals so that power produced in that area could
be sent to state C. Through such a domino-like process, power available in
one region effectively can help alleviate a shortage in another area - with
only a series of relatively short-distance transmissions.
Development of such an integrated electricity transmission network is what
the federal government can and should foster. It would strengthen the nation;
it would expand options for users; it would increase competition among
suppliers, to the benefit of consumers; it would overcome the multiplicity of
state regulations that have the effect of restricting incentives for
profitable interstate power transmission.
The Interstate Highway System did not solve all the problems of the nation's
escalating population of cars, and it was not cheap. But, designed to
maximize interconnections between metropolitan areas, with ample systemwide
capacity to spare, it did transform the country, binding the 48 contiguous
states into an integrated whole.
The effect: reduced costs and increased "exports" of California fruits and
vegetables to the Midwest, and reduced costs, along with increased exports of
Midwest manufactured products to the West.
Just as it does not make sense for every state to act like a separate
country, building roads just for its own residents, or growing all of its own
food supply, it is equally inefficient for each state to independently
develop its own power supply. It is foolish to find electricity producers in
one state claiming that they should not "help out" consumers in another
state.
A nationwide system would take better advantage of differential electricity
demand in various parts of the country, seasonally and even in the course of
a day.
To consumers and industrial users in California, the effects of a national
electricity transmission grid would be real and enduring, but not
spectacular. It would, however, go far to achieving the quiet result that
every consumer seeks - lower prices, more reliable electric power supplies.
There is no single solution to California's energy crisis, but developing a
national interstate electricity highway system would go far toward addressing
it. Local power distribution within a state would remain a matter of state
control. The federal government's role would be largely to provide financial
incentives for constructing additional interstate transmission capacity, and
to establish standards for its design and utilization - just as is the case
with the Interstate Highway System.
A survey of history and government professors conducted by the Brookings
Institution last year identified the Interstate Highway System as one of the
Top Seven governmental achievements of the last 50 years - along with
rebuilding Europe after World War II and expanding the right to vote. An
interstate electricity highway system could well be among the top
achievements of government in the next half-century.
MACRO POWER TRANSMISSION
WE HAVE AN ELECTRIC power crisis in California. In fact, we have two
problems: a short-term problem and a long-term problem.
Short term, the problem, from the consumer perspective, is:
-- Soaring electricity bills.
-- Fear of paying the mounting debts being incurred by electricity
distributors such as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. either in rate increases or
higher taxes.
-- The threat, and to some users the reality, of no lights, no refrigeration,
no heat.
These concerns are real and severe. But they are merely symptoms of a serious
long-term crisis: Incentives to the power industry are wrong!
As Adam Smith reminded us over two centuries ago, we do not look to the good
intentions of sellers to get them to serve the public interest; we look to
their self interest. Then, as today, wise public policy calls for aligning
the two, by providing incentives for the development of an electricity system
that provides power that is dependable, is produced efficiently and is
distributed competitively, so that prices are low.
This long-term problem will not be solved by the series of Band-Aids that
governmental officials and power producers and distributors are skirmishing
over. Now is the time to develop a long-term plan.
Two elements of a long-term plan for efficient and reliable electricity are
clear:
-- Electricity self-sufficiency for each state is bad policy. It is easy to
think that dependency on power imports from other states is a root problem.
It is not. Trade and competition mean access to more producers, and that can
bring efficiency in electricity no less than in food, electronics or autos,
as low-cost sources are utilized. (Promoting more interstate options does not
preclude building more local generation, and small, "micro" electricity
generating units do have a role as part of an overall electricity policy.
However, the advantage of their flexibility must be balanced against their
generally higher cost for meeting predictable long-term demand.)
-- Incentives are needed to encourage investment in electricity transmission.
It does no good to have low-cost power production unless the power can reach
users. This is why the federal government has such an important role to play
in financially encouraging and supporting a national interstate power highway
system.

Governor Calls for 10% Cut In Usage
On national TV, Davis increases goal on energy

N44189.DTL
Signaling a greater urgency in California's power crisis, Gov. Gray Davis
said yesterday that keeping the lights and air conditioners running this
summer will require every Californian to reduce electricity usage by about 10
percent.
In addition, he said, the state must get more electrical power online by
then.
His call for a 10 percent cut is a significant jump from the 7 percent he was
asking for during his State of the State speech last month, and it may be a
difficult stretch for consumers. Davis made his remarks on NBC's news show
"Meet the Press."
State Sen. Don Perata, D-Oakland, praised the governor's statement on
national television.
"The most important thing right now is that the governor said that, because
there has been general skepticism statewide, reflected both in anecdotes and
public opinion polls, that we are in fact facing a crisis," Perata said. "If
you don't believe, you won't conform, you won't respond."
But, he said, Davis will not get the conservation he wants unless consumers
are given financial incentives. Perata said he will propose legislation today
to give $1 billion to customers who cut down on their electricity use during
the summer months.
Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at the University of
California at Berkeley, said if temperatures soar this summer, it will take a
"huge effort" to keep the state at safe electricity levels.
NEED FOR CONSERVATION
"We are in big trouble," Borenstein said. "That doesn't mean we can't avoid
blackouts -- that means we will have to take serious measures."
The needed steps include instituting variable prices for commercial and
industrial users that reflect the supply and demand at any given hour and
hooking up air conditioners to cycling systems, he said. For residential
users,
he said, it will mean increases for use above a certain level.
Forecasters predict a shortfall of at least 5,000 megawatts this summer, but
the state got some good news Thursday when the California Independent System
Operator, which coordinates the flow of electricity through the state's power
grid, removed all power alerts for the first time in more than a month.
Lorie O'Donley, a spokeswoman for the California ISO, said that she does not
expect any changes today but that it is too early to make any predictions
about the summer power situation.
"We still need to check the snowpack and the hills and the hydro situation in
the state," O'Donley said. "Conservation is a big part of it, and whatever
people can do to step up their conservation efforts will be a huge factor in
avoiding blackouts."
GOVERNOR DODGES BLAME
Davis appeared on "Meet the Press" while visiting Washington, D.C., for a
meeting of the National Governors Association and a concurrent meeting of the
Democratic Governors Association, which he chairs. With him on the program
were Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., and Republican
Gov. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas.
Davis took the opportunity of the high-profile television show to tell East
Coast decisionmakers and Wall Street analysts that the blame for the state's
energy crisis does not lie with him and to reassure them that he is taking
solid steps to resolve the problem.
"Both President Bush and I inherited California, a flawed deregulation
system," he said during the broadcast. "Secondly, no major plant has been
built in California prior to my governorship for 12 years."
He outlined some solutions, including the approval of nine new power plants,
with six under construction and three expected to be online this summer, and
14 more in the pipeline.
In a slip of the tongue, Davis said on yesterday morning's broadcast that
consumers would need to cut electricity use to only 10 percent of last year.
"It will require every Californian using about 10 percent of the electricity
than they did the year before and a little luck in getting some extra
megawatts on line this summer," Davis said.
What he meant, a spokesman said, was they had to cut use by 10 percent.
Still, that will require significant sacrifice.
In addition, Davis has said that he wants to add 5,000 megawatts of power --
enough for 5 million homes -- by summer. He has promised to speed up the
approval process and provide bonuses to builders who finish before July.
The state also established an $800 million conservation program this year.
But Borenstein said that many of the ideas floating around for spending the
conservation money are for efforts that would not help for about another
three years.
ON NATIONAL MATTERS
During yesterday's show, Davis also weighed in on President Bush's tax-cut
proposal and former President Bill Clinton's controversial last-minute
pardons.
The administration should wait for a tax cut until the money is available, he
said.
"All of us who have been in government for a while have seen the roller-
coaster ride of surpluses and then shortages and surpluses and shortages," he
said. "Clearly, people need tax relief, but it should be moderated to the
point where we don't kill the golden goose, which is a strong, growing
economy. "
Although he received a significant campaign donation from the father of
Carlos Vignali, the Los Angeles drug kingpin, Davis told show host Tim
Russert that he never spoke with the family about the presidential pardon
Vignali received on Clinton's last day in office.
Davis said he did not have enough information to know whether the pardon was
a mistake, but, he said, "there's something about them in general that
doesn't ring right."
"However," he said, "people expect us to focus on things that matter to them,
and they really want to see progress on education, the environment, tax
relief, health care."
Asked by Russert whether he is going to run for president in 2004, Davis did
not rule it out but said that only re-election to the governorship in 2002 is
on his horizon.
"I'm focused on keeping the lights on and making our schools better," he
said.

Tom Burns from GPC called to advise that his contacts with the Alberta Gov't
told him that Premier Klein and Justice Minister Hancock intended to put out
a news release between 1:15pm and 1:30 pm today indicating the Gov't has
decided to call a hearing/inquiry on energy pricing in Alberta.  Tom does
not  know what the form of this hearing/inquiry will be (i.e. an AEUB hearing
or an independent inquiry (judicial or otherwise)) or whether it will involve
natural gas and power or just power.   Tom's sense was that the mandate of
the hearing/inquiry would be focused on providing policy makers with a clear
understanding of the factors that are producing high energy price levels in
Alberta and whether there are any policy steps that could/should be taken to
address the current price levels.  He did not think the tone of the news
release would be that the Government of Alberta needs to put a stop to the
energy price gouging of consumers in Alberta.
A few minutes ago Tom Burns called me back to advise that Klein has now
decided to delay the release of the new release until at least tomorrow as
the Tory caucus has a half-day meeting tomorrow morning and the Premier wants
to discuss how the Gov't should approach this issue with members of his
caucus before he proceeds with the idea of a hearing/inquiry.
I have heard nothing from industry players so far about the DJ story except
the Chairman of the Independent Power Producers Society of Alberta circulated
the DJ story by email to the members of the IPPSA Board today with the
following comment:   "It is too bad that the government has resorted to this
tactic.  I guess they have a lot of pressure on them."

Rob

I got this from Hanson.  Please advise as to which points we agree with and

Just talked to Peevey.  He told me that he and Freeman personally worked with
Bilas on Bilas' draft decision--the decision designed to make CDWR
creditworthy and keep the PUC from touching Direct Access until the
Legislature has a chance to fix the AB1X prohibition.

I made the pitch re: decision does what it takes to fix the creditworthy
issue and the Commission needs to vote it out immediately.  He said he agreed
but expressed his general frustration with the decision making process
generally, and said that he is not certain right now if the decision is
greased to get voted out at the next Commission meeting.

He said that he's going to be talking to the Governor this afternoon and will
push the issue with him.  I asked him to keep me updated.  He said that he
would.

I told him that it wasn't helpful that the Governor named names in New York
regarding alleged agreements about "haircuts," particularly when folks are
trying to negotiate deals with DWR. He wasn't aware of that and asked me to
fax him the Merril press, which I did.  I'll also fax him our letter
supporting the Bilas decision.

Best,
Jeff

The last thing you want is to be cross examined on your originally innocent
email, now a "smoking gun" expanded into a 6 foot exhibit in court or
arbitration. There are a number of precautions we can all take to prevent
written material,  including emails from becoming evidence in litigation or
arbitration.  Here are some guidelines:

1. Because we are preparing for litigation or arbitration, all
communications, correspondence, emails, documents, agendas, presentations
etc. relating in any way to the force majeure claims, the change orders,
defaults, termination, the consent (absence of) etc. should have the
following notation: "prepared at the direction of counsel in anticipation of
litigation--attorney/client privilege."  This includes presentation
materials/reports to Rebecca McDonald or upper management, etc.

2.  If business people or any other non-lawyers are going to ask for
information of the participants in the project, you should couch your
requests in language that suggests you are acting as agents for counsel.  In
other words, your requests for information should state,  "We have been asked
by counsel to assist in gathering information in preparation for litigation.
To assist us in assisting counsel we would appreciate it if you would provide
the following information." Or ask me and I'll send an email or give
instruction.

3.  There is no guaranty that even with these measures the communications
will remain privileged.  As a result, the less in writing from one business
person to another the better.  All written communications that contain
assessments of the facts, such as opinions as to what happened, etc should be
addressed directly to John Gardiner (jgardine@skadden.com) or me and only to
Gardiner or me.  Opinions are smoking guns.  Think before you write things
down or before you fire off an email.  Use the phone when you can.

4.  For those of you participating in the investigation of force majeure
claims: Jim Bermudez of Wilson Management Associates is conducting an
investigation of the force majeure claims and change orders.  Because Jim has
been hired by counsel to conduct the investigation in anticipation of
litigation, his notes, thought processes, conversations etc. are privileged.
The best approach for each of you to take is simply to talk with Jim and
allow him to take notes. You should avoid putting anything in writing, let
him do it.  If you must write something, remember to note that it is
"prepared at the direction of counsel in anticipation of litigation" and
address it to John Gardiner or me, even if you give it to Jim.  When in
doubt, just call or email me and I'll help you figure out what to do.

5.  Along those same lines, if anyone on the team decides an internal
investigation or study should be conducted for any reason, and you decide you
need to hire a consultant or expert to do it, please let me know so we can
retain them through counsel.  All it takes is a letter to protect the
investigation.  This is especially true with technical experts and
investigations about any technical problems with the plant.  Because it is
foreseeable that we could end up in litigation with the contractor or with an
insurance company over coverage resulting from technical problems, it is
prudent to protect these types of materials if you can.  Remember, this
happened to us in the Dominican Republic and it is happening right now in
India.

6.   On the weekly calls or meetings where attorneys are present, get in the
habit of stating so in your notes and write Attorney Client Privilege at the
beginning.  This is a good, routine business practice regardless of what you
are working on.

Please call or email me if you have any questions. 713-345-6159.

Ed,
As you are aware, we are currently looking for some ERC's to satisfy an

looking for approximately 175 Lbs/Yr VOC credits to satisfy this ATC. While
I was looking for credits on the APCD web sight @ valleyair.org, I came
across a list of available VOC Credits that are being held by Aera Energy
for the NCL gas plant (please see credits below), I asked Mark Poe about
these credits and he has referred me to a Darryl Gunderson of Aera Energy.
Mark informed me that he is the one that handles all of the ERC's and would
be able to help me on this. I will contact Darryl on this issue ASAP and as
we talked earlier, I am going to ask him if these credits should have been
transferred to Koch during the acquisition of the NCL Gas Plant and if not
I will see if we can purchase the necessary amounts to satisfy the ATC.

Ed, can you do me a favor and check the sales agreement between Arco & Koch
to see if there is any mention of these credits. Also inform me ASAP
whether or not to approach Darryl on these credits

Thanks,
Scott

I spoke with Craig Glazer, the new director for PJM regarding their concept
for PJM West, which includes the following:

- Single market, rules, and tariffs for all companies
- No seams
- Reliability criteria of existing control areas in ECAR etc,
- PJM West could use PJM market
- A power exchange such as APX could be established as a competitive option
for day ahead transactions.
- Designed to be flexible
- Native Load exception is eliminated
- LMP
- Transcos could be a part of it

We talked at length about LMP and I suggested the hybrid as an option for a
variety of reasons.  He does not believe the hybrid method will work because
a study demonstrated that using past information to develop commercially
significant flowgates does not work since the paths will change, resulting in
insufficient coverage of costs which would have to be socialized.  He further
stated that there is insufficient data in the midwest to identify the
constraints and we would have to rely on info provided by companies like AEP.

Given our current efforts to develop a single RTO, I think we should meet
with the PJM folks and talk to them about our issues and see if we can come
to some agreements.  Craig thinks it is logical that FE might join PJM West.
I asked him if they were open to alternatives to LMP and he said he didn't
know.

Please do not hesitate to contact Robert Johnston (x39934) or Kristin Walsh
(x39510) with additional questions.

Executive Summary
An announcement could be made as early as today regarding the first wave of
long-term contracts (price and term).
The threat of bankruptcy is significantly diminishing as Davis hatches a plan
to 1) pass on "court ordered rate increases" and 2) issue revenue bonds.
Audit results are in and questions loom about the amount of funds transferred
to parent companies.  Davis is expected to use the threat of "endless
appeals" in courts and a possible ballot initiative in November to keep the
pressure on the parent companies to pay a share of the utility debt, as well
as to limit the scope of the rate hikes.
Davis hopes that a court ruling in favor of the utilities would provide him
with the political cover he needs to pass on rate hikes to California
consumers and avoid utility bankruptcy.
Davis walking a fine line with consumer advocacy groups.  If there is a
ballot initiative in November to challenge the expected court-ordered rate
hikes, it could be disastrous for investor confidence in the state.

Legislation and Bail Out
Bill AB1X was heard for several hours in the Senate Appropriations
yesterday.  Issues still remain regarding the tiered rate structure,
specifically for communities that have harsh climates.  However, the bill has
received support from almost everyone including consumer groups.   The bill
is expected to pass sometime today.  Tim Gage, CA Director of Finance said
Davis supports all the provisions in AB1X and expected to sign.

Bill AB18X was not heard in the Assembly yesterday but is expected to be hear
today.  In committee hearings Monday, the DWR testified it is spent all of
the $400M and were spending $45M/day in the spot market to buy power.

According to sources with direct access to Governor Davis, the on-going court
battle, as discussed below, is viewed as an excellent opportunity for a
settlement.  Davis recognizes that 1) the expected court ruling in the CPUC
case will likely authorize the utilities to increase rates charged to
California rate payers; 2) despite that ruling, the state government has the
ability to delay the eventual reward of that order long enough to cripple the
two utilities unless they come to terms.  Thus, Davis believes that
California consumers cannot avoid getting  hit with higher electricity
charges, but he plans to use the threat of an appeal (and a possible ballot
initiative) to limit the amount of the rate hikes.

A plan to exempt the lowest income, smallest consumers from any rate increase
and to concentrate rate increases among consumers using 130% of a baseline
usage rate was gaining serious momentum last night in Sacramento.  That would
still hit about one half of all consumers (since the "baseline" is set at 60%
of average consumption), but it is "progressive" in a politically important
sense.

Making this work would require solving a minor crisis that erupted last night
when PG&E admitted they had stopped reading electricity meters for many
customers and were estimating their bills based on previous usage rates.
The company's defense (they had laid off meter readers to conserve cash) was
met with widespread derision as consumer advocates pointed out the estimation
policy conveniently allowed the company to charge more despite serious
efforts by Californians to use less electricity.   "Every time you think
there's a moment when these utilities will not embarrass themselves,
something like this happens," one legislator moaned.

Long-Term Contracts

A second key to keeping the eventual rate increases down lies in the
negotiations now almost complete for the first wave of long-term power buying
contracts Davis initiated earlier this month.  The first wave of those
contracts will be announced perhaps as early as today and they will be
surprisingly positive, according to officials in the talks.  "We got a series
of good offers in those initial proposals.   And some not so good ones," one
official told our source.   "The idea is to announce the results of the first
contract talks with the good guys and then go back to the others and say,
'you want in on this with these terms?'   We think we'll eventually shake
loose a lot of supply with this strategy."

Bankruptcy

Because of these new dynamics, there is improved market confidence that
California will emerge from the current energy crisis without bankruptcy for
SoCal Edison and PG&E, even as they are set to miss another round of payments
to creditors and suppliers today (remember, there is a standstill agreement
among creditors not to ask for accelerated payment until Feb. 13).

We believe that sense of optimism will be given an even more credible boost
by the court case in front of US District Judge Ronald S.W. Lew in Los
Angeles, which is likely to mushroom into the kind of political cover for
elected officials that make a settlement possible by the end of next week, at
the latest.  In fact, without that political cover it would be impossible to
square all the various circles of this crisis.

Audit Results and Ballot Initiatives
Markets, Bush administration officials, and perhaps utility companies
themselves are underweighting the possibility that citizens groups will
launch a successful ballot initiative in the fall of 200l to bring all
electricity generation back under state control.  The threat of a proposition
initiative mounted as the two audits of the utility companies ordered by the
California Public Utilities Commission released in the last 48 hours
confirmed two seriously damaging points we have been warning about since
mid-January.  First, the audit of SoCal Edison confirmed that $2 billion of
the debt the utility claims it owes to energy suppliers is actually owed to
itself through its corporate holding structure that generates and sells
power.  Second, it confirmed that Edison electric paid nearly $5 billion in
profits to the holding company which then used that money to buy back its
stock and increase dividends in an effort to keep its stock price up even
while it was going on a debt-issuing binge.

The audit of PG&E released late last night was even more damaging: PG&E
management was sharply criticized for poor decisions in failing to react to
"clear warning signs of an approaching energy crisis" by not making deep
spending cuts, "including scaling back management salaries."  The auditors
also questioned the utility's decision to funnel some $4.7 billion of its
profits since deregulation into the coffers of its parent holding company,
which then used the cash mostly to pay dividends and buy back stocks.
"Basically, they took the money and ran," as State Senate Speaker Burton put
it yesterday.

What appears to be Governor Gray Davis' grudging acceptance of reality is
actually a highly evolved effort to produce a solution that provides enough
rate hikes/taxpayer subsidy to help solve the current crisis without
triggering a new -- and far more damaging -- burst of populist outrage among
a voter base that still thinks the utility companies are basically making
this all up.  There is no doubt that this use of money by SoCal Edison and
the debts it owes to itself are perfectly legal and in keeping with the
spirit of the 1996 deregulation law, but that is irrelevant in popular
political terms.  Were it not for the political cover potentially afforded by
the court case discussed below, these audits would make settlement extremely
difficult.

Keeping that anger from exploding into a ballot initiative this fall is key
to understanding the very complex game that Davis, his advisers and senior
legislators are now playing.   A ballot initiative would be a potential
disaster since it would almost certainly be aimed at re-establishing full
public control over the electric utilities.  Even if the state and utilities
successfully challenged such an initiative in court it would be years before
that victory was clear and it would freeze all new private investment during
that prolonged period.   That's something California cannot afford as
businesses would be moving out and new ones failing to relocate.

Court Battle
Thus, legislators are listening in horror as they hear the ugly details of
the court case in Los Angeles that SoCal Edison and PG&E are likely to win in
mid-February.  The court will most likely grant the two utilities $12.7
billion in relief and that the cost would fall immediately on the shoulders
of consumers who would see bills rise by at least 30%, California politicians
could see the emergence of the one thing everyone has needed since the start
of this extended drama: political cover. Davis will then have to rely on his
political and negotiating skills to pressure the parent companies of the
utilities to pass on something less than the full $12.7 billion debt.

PG&E and SoCal Edison have already won round one of a legal battle designed
to let them raise electricity rates enough to recover all of the debt they
have accumulated since August last year when the PUC refused to let them
raise prices even as electricity prices soared.  The court said the 1996
deregulation law was crystal clear -- when the two utilities had repaid
so-called "stranded costs," they were free to begin charging whatever they
needed to charge consumers to cover their cost of acquiring power.

Although the utilities won this case, the Judge stayed his order until
February 14th at the state government's request.  As that deadline
approaches, an intense new negotiating round is under way.  On the one hand,
political officials know they have the ultimate political cover for higher
electric prices ("the courts made me do it"), but on the other hand, they
also know that immediate and full compliance with that court order would
force electricity rates up by about 40% on top of natural gas bills that have
soared by about 300% since last year.  Utility companies are playing this
card aggressively in negotiations about the scope and shape of the final
bailout.  "We'll just wait until the court puts the order into effect in
mid-February then even if we are in bankruptcy we will emerge quickly and
easily."

One tactic the state political officials are using, in order to force a
settlement, is the threat of keeping the law suit tied up in court for the
next couple of years.  One political official pointed out that they could
keep the utilities from receiving their money this year, next year or perhaps
even the year after. "Sure, we tell them, they will probably win in court and
get that money.  Eventually.  We are making them well aware that unless we
have a settlement we will appeal that court ruling all the way to the Supreme
Court and keep them tied up for the next two years at least.  We don't think
the creditors will be quite that patient."

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I fielded a call today from Mr. Rob Cooper of U.S. Gypsum.  Mr. Cooper
indicated that he's been in contact with Lorraine for purposes of acquiring
Red Rock expansion capacity.  Moreover, Mr. Cooper has been in contact with
SoCal Gas in order that SoCal Gas recognize firm deliveries from Transwestern
at Needles in excess of the current (sustainable) limit of 750 MMcf/d.

Mr. Cooper insists that he is making progress with SoCal Gas aimed at lifting
the 750 window to 760, and that SoCal Gas has indicated U.S. Gypsum would be
entitled to an exclusive right to the increased amount.   While trying not to
be argumentative, I told Mr. Cooper that if SoCal Gas was willing to set
aside a discrete increment of capacity for a single shipper, it would be a
radical departure from current SoCal Gas policy.  Currently, SoCal Gas does
not provide unbundled intrastate transmission.  They have only accepted or
not accepted pipeline nominations, as the case may be, as an aggregate
volume, with no distinction being drawn on who the upstream shippers were.

I set about to try to explain that there is no correlation (other than
coincidental timing) between (1) TW discussions with SoCal Gas at raising the
capacity window at Needles and (2) TW's effort to sell Red Rock Expansion
space.  In addition, I attempted to explain that TW feels it will be required
to follow certain rules pursuant to its tariff and FERC policy associated
with making new delivery point capacity available on a non-discriminatory
basis.  With respect to this issue, I told Mr. Cooper that, although we're
currently discussing it, we'd yet to come to any decision on how, if
incremental capacity does become available at Needles, TW would make such
delivery point capacity available to its shippers.

Mr. Cooper then proceeded to launch into a diatribe about how, if that's the
case, then "he's wasted 3 weeks in active negotiations" with both SoCal Gas
and TW aimed at securing capacity at Needles.  He said on several occasions
that "end game" for him was to secure a firm portal from the interstate
system onto and through the SoCal Gas system.  Mr. Cooper also expressed a
concern that if he's forced into a competitive bidding situation with other
big marketing companies (in his words, "such as ENA") for Needles capacity,
then he probably couldn't compete, and once again, would be left on the
outside looking in.  He pointed to the El Paso Merchant deal on EPNG as a
prime example.

Mr. Cooper said he wasn't ready to accept my explanation as to why TW
couldn't commit to offering U.S. Gypsum an exclusive right to any incremental
Needles capacity, and asked that I formally "run it up the flagpole" to
senior management and get back with him by telephone with TW's "official
position."   As an editorial comment, I'm not sure Mr. Cooper completely
understands (or cares about) the landscape here.  I'd go so far as to say
that from his style and the tone of his conversation with me, he won't easily
take "no" or even a "maybe" as an answer.   The difficulty for TW is going to
be in trying to persuade him that we're interested in his business and
sympathize with his position, but that we face real legal and/or regulatory
issues here, and they cannot be dismissed or ignored by U.S. Gypsum or any
other customer.

I'd like to be in a position to call him back on Friday and give him TW's
"official position" on his request for Needles service in the Red Rock
expansion.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Help?

Executive Summary:

The likelihood of there being an involuntary bankruptcy filing against the utilities appears to be greater than 60%.  This is not only due to the circumstances surrounding the filed rate doctrine case mentioned below, but also because the 30-day cure period during which the utilities have not been paying their bills will end this week, increasing the likelihood that their IPP creditors will act against them.  If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly.

1.	Utilities vs. CPUC

Governor Davis' attempt to delay the filed rate doctrine case will not succeed.  The case will come before the judge on Monday, February 12th.  The federal judge is expected to rule a summary judgment in favor of the utilities.  However, the judge will not allow the utilities to collect the injunction release they are requesting ($.01/kwh).  This will be left to an appellate court.  The decision not to allow the utilities to collect this cash could trigger an involuntary bankruptcy filing, by the smaller IPPs (as noted in our reports last week) or by larger out-of-state generators such as Duke, Reliant, and Dynegy (as noted in the press this morning).  This is expected next week or the week after.

2.	Prospects for a Bailout

Bill AB 18X is effectively dead from lack of support.

Senator Burton, despite his public refusals, is moving closer to agreeing to a utility bail-out.  The statements by Burton and the CA State Treasurer are merely a negotiating position.  They are more concerned about the possibility of a bankruptcy than they appear.  For Burton, this is because of his long association with labor unions; the unions oppose the utility bankruptcy.

Burton has been negotiating with consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield so as not to get attacked by him.  The deal Burton is expected to arrange would be for:

Bonds to be issued by the utilities rather than the state, but with some kind of state support (but less than "full faith and credit of the state of CA," which would not pass).  This would amount to the securitization of an extra charge on power bills (e.g. $.01, though the actual amount is not known).  These bonds would be asset-backed securities, with payment receivable from rate payers.  The term of these bonds is unknown; if the term is made quite long (e.g. 20 years), the associated rate increase could be very small.
The state would purchase the utilities' transmission assets for a very high price.  The amount of the extra charge on power bills will not be known until the price of the transmission assets is settled.

If the state loses the filed rate doctrine case today (which it is believed will happen) and there is an involuntary bankruptcy filing (or even the threat of one), sources believe that this bail-out plan will be enacted quickly.  As noted in an earlier report, the California legislature habitually does not act until things "hit the wall."

It is expected that the Republicans in the legislature will follow Burton's lead and support the bail-out plan.  The Assembly members in particular are not yet supportive of a plan of this nature.  One moderate democratic legislator with whom our source spoke said that the opposition to a bail-out in her Central Valley district is "50 to 1."   However, an involuntary filing (or the threat thereof) may be enough to trigger legislative support.  It would allow the argument of an "imminent threat" to the people of the state of California.

3.	Consumer Opposition

Harvey Rosenfield is too short on cash to fight this plan and the associated rate increase with anything but a referendum.  If the referendum fails, he intends to attack individual legislators (though not John Burton, who reportedly has "immunity" from Rosenfield).

Some legislators are thinking of voting for the bail-out plan, then supporting a referendum from Rosenfield later.  However, if the bail-out plan and rate increase described above is passed through the legislature as a bill (rather than put in place by the PUC, for example), it cannot be reversed by a referendum.  As additional insurance against Rosenfield, by supporting the bonds issued under the plan, the state can argue that its credit would be impaired in the case of a referendum to repeal the plan.  While it is not clear that this is a factual argument, it still might impede any referendum.

Kay,
Our deal with Panda Energy involves 4 LM units.  I believe that this is the
total number of units in our current LV Co Gen project.  Ben is planning to
talk with Lee at GE.
I talked with Panda this morning.  They do not have a fixed close date.  They
are working off the assumption that closing will ocurr within 4-6 weeks of
signing the Letter Agreement.  I believe that this is doable.
Chris Booth will provide you with respective unit delivery dates.  He is
working with Matt Tezyk to determine the serial #'s (apparently GE has not
yet assigned serial #'s to the units).  What price are we assigning to the
LLC member interests in the Northwestern Letter Agreement?  Let's stay
consistent with that document.  The person who will be signing for Panda is
Gary Hubbard, Senior Vice President.
The purchase price is $16.45 MM per unit with a 10% development fee payable
to ENA upon execution of the Letter Agreement.  The balance of the purchase
price will escrowed by Panda upon approval of the Facility Agreement (similar
to Intergen structure) and payable to ENA at closing.  Is this the pricing
information that you need to establish the maximum liability amont?
Ben:  We need to talk re: the transformers.  We quoted Panda $950K per unit
for the two transformers.  It is not clear if the transformers will work for
Panda w.r.t. interconnect voltage and plant configuration.  If we are
re-loading with more LM's, do we need to keep the transformers for our use at
LV Co-Gen?
Kathleen:  I have a call into Bill Lamb at Panda regarding the CA's.  I will
let you know when I hear back from him.

Bill,  the baseline noise surveys, which have been completed, were performed
by Hoover and Keith out of Houston, Tx.  I have a meeting scheduled with the
permit engineers from state of Arizona on Monday to discuss the permitting
for the two C/S on state lands.  Ive dealt with these individuals before, but
the ADEQ has gone through some reg changes and I want to visit with them on
that.  After that meeting, I will decide who should do the applications.  I
have  calls in to the person I deal with in the EPA in San Francisco for the
two locations on the Navajo lands.  Pending the outcome of each  meeting, I
will decide who to use.  Ive used Argent in the past for both Arizona permits
and Indian lands permits, and they would probably be my first choice.

I am keeping Mr. Ayers involved in the permitting process and all changes or
activities that impact the permits for Arizona.  One thing that I shold
mention is that I spoke with Phil Lowery about his desires for this project.
He has requested that the existing units at each station maintain operations
for six months after the turbines have been installed to act as a backup in
the event that the turbines temporary fail or to iron out any potential
kinks.  Based upon the reduction in emissions from the existing mainline
units, which will be permitted for a six month period, there will still be an
overall  major emissions decrease.  After the six month period, the existing
units will be abandoned in place and not be operated again.    Also, my
intent is to permit these turbines at 45 ppm NOx as opposed to the lower 25
ppm NOx number to eleminate the problems that were originally encountered on
the Northern Border system.  If this was a new station, I probably wouldnt be
allowed to use the 45 number, but seeing as how there will be a major
decrease in emissions from shutting off the recips and using the turbine,
this should be easy to do.  The differrence in emission between 45 and 25 is
not that great and it will allow the facilities in Az a larger range of
operation comfort as opposed to the 25 ppm number that Rolls says they can
do, but has had trouble reaching.  One thing that has complicated the
permitting is the elevation and temperature extremes at the locations.  By
permitting at 45 ppm, this will greatly help this.     Ill share the
emissions numbers with you, when I receive them from Rolls and the emissions
info I have from the existing units.

I have spoken to Terry Hacket about doing the F-1 document for the FERC
submittal, and have been feeding him data and supporting information for the
report.  Based upon the scope of work for the turbine installation, the F-1
report will be completed by March 1.

Is there something Ive missed?

Folks:
I just got off the phone with Lee Johnson at GE. I described the overall deal
to him ("Intergen" style deal with the current 4 LV Cogen units, and a
purchase of 4 additional units as a replacement), but did not disclose that
the counterparty is Panda. Lee is totally on board, and thought this would be
a great transaction. Based on this, I think our GE risk is minimal, which
means that our primary commercial focus needs to be on making sure Panda is
prepared to transact, and if they remain as interested, making sure we
proceed with as simple a transaction as possible.
I would suggest that we have an all hands conference call to discuss the
transaction as soon as possible.
Fred-could you please contact everyone and set this up? I'm available all day
today, and tomorrow to 3 PM EST.
As soon as I get the revised proposal from Lee, I will forward it to the

I've attached (admittedly incomplete) the Project Check List for a proposed gas-fired electric generation plant to be located off TW and EPNG near Belen, N.M.  The customer has requested that TW provide an estimate to construct an interconnect with both TW and EPNG and to build the lateral pipeline facility to their plant site.  I've attached below a copy of the email I received yesterday from Steve Rutherford requesting this estimate.  This project (at least as far as TW is concerned) is in its earliest stage of development.  However, in order to proceed, the customer would like a (+/- 30%) estimate from TW in order to factor in the interconnects/lateral costs into its economics.  On a parallel path, I'll be working on the deal structure with the customer to provide adequate payback and return of investment in the facility, along with operating costs and return.

Please provide me a timetable for getting an estimate out to this customer.  I know they asked for next Monday, but I've already sent them a note indicating it might take a bit longer.  Also, if you need additional information in order to provide this estimate, please don't hesitate to contact Steve Rutherford directly.  I'd only ask that if you email him, you'd copy me on the email for my files.  Thanks.

Thanks, Jeanne:
Couple of thoughts.
1) If California wants to get out of this crisis, it's critical that DWR be
creditworthy.  Bilas' proposal helps in that regard.  We've been thinking
pretty hard about the issue and working with DWR to try to fix
creditworthiness concerns.  Christian, it might make sense to put together
some comments supporting Bilas' approach and perhaps give him some additional
recommendations about what the PUC needs to do to get DWR creditworthy? If
so, (see note below), we have an opportunity to provide those comments to the
PUC by this Friday.
2) Scott Govenar--on the direct access piece.  Seems like it would be very
useful to get the DA coalition we're working with in Sacramento to jointly
file some comments on Friday in response to the Bilas proposal supporting a
ban on any PUC action on the DA prohibition since the Legislature is still
working on it.  What are your thoughts?  And if you and the rest of the
Sacramento team agree, can we work with Jeanne to get some (brief) language
put together and work to get the rest of the coalition to sign on.
Alternatively, we could work to get the other folks file individually.  Your
thoughts on both approaches is appreciated.

Rate hike in the offing
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER
SAN FRANCISCO -- An energy crisis that has already brought widespread power
blackouts is now set to hit Californians' bank accounts with a large rate
increase that is headed for approval today.
State regulators are weighing a 30 percent hike on electricity rates that
would come on top of a smaller, temporary rate increase that was adopted in
January. The temporary increase also is expected to be made permanent today
by the Public Utilities Commission.
Still to be determined is the question of who will bear the brunt of the rate
increases, which are expected to appear on the May bills of California's 7.5
million utility customers.
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said the rate
increases are needed to replenish more than $4 billion in ongoing electricity
purchases by the state treasury and allow utilities to continue to buy
electricity from alternative energy companies.
The rate increase also satisfies conditions that are needed before the state
can borrow $10 billion or more to finance its power buys.
Lynch also said she will propose a tiered rate structure that would penalize
those who use the most electricity and leave nearly half the state's utility
customers, who use relatively little, untouched by the increase.
Seen as inevitable by many observers, the politically volatile issue of rate
hikes is nevertheless another admission that the state's foray into
electricity deregulation, which was supposed to lead to cheaper and more
plentiful electricity, has failed.
Consumer groups, calling the proposed rate hikes a $4.8 billion gift to
utilities, responded by saying they would hasten plans to take the state's
energy mess to voters through a ballot initiative. Among their proposals:
rolling back rates, forcing a state takeover of power plants or implementing
an excess profits tax on energy companies.
"The ratepayer revolt is under way," said Harvey Rosenfield, president of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "The voters are going to have to
take matters into their own hands at the ballot box. It will be a bloodbath."
Meanwhile, Gov. Gray Davis immediately distanced himself from the rate-hike
proposal.
"The governor believes tiered pricing could promote the conservation
California needs if structured properly but was not convinced of that by the
data made available to him last week," according to a statement from Davis'
office Monday. "He has asked for more information, which should be available
this week. The governor has not had conversations with any commissioners
about a potential rate hike. It is still his hope and expectation that this
matter can be resolved within the existing rate structure."
Some observers were incredulous, noting Davis' reputation as a micromanager
who keeps appointees on a short leash.
"The PUC has been run like his personal cabinet for a year and a half," said
Gary Ackerman, director of the Western Power Trading Forum, a Menlo
Park-based association of electricity generators and traders. "This one's got
me floored. The governor once again is a day late. The Oscars for best actor
were last night."
Confronted with teetering utilities, alternative energy companies that were
refusing to sell power in the state and state coffers bleeding by about $50
million a day, Lynch unveiled a set of four interwoven decisions that the
commission is scheduled to vote on today.
The measures would:
Raise consumer rates by 3 cents per kilowatt-hour, and make permanent a 1
cent temporary hike implemented in January. Before the January rate hike,
Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers paid a 9.4 cents per kilowatt-hour for
electricity, 5.4 cents of which was earmarked for the utility's energy buys.
If the hike is approved, those figures will rise to 13.4 cents per
kilowatt-hour on average, 9.4 cents of which will be used for electricity
purchases.
Determine how much of that money will be used to reimburse the state
treasury, which has committed more than $4 billion to electricity purchases
since mid-January. Lynch said Monday that although the state has not yet
submitted data on its power buys, she believes the proposed rate hike will
fully reimburse state coffers.
Order the utilities to pay alternative energy companies, some of which have
shut down operations because they are not getting paid. The order would apply
to buys already under contract but not to the $1.5 billion that the utilities
owe for electricity already used.
Launch a PUC investigation into whether the utilities have improperly
sheltered profits in their holding companies and subsidiaries.
The proposals focus on the state's power buys and the utilities' upcoming
power purchases and do nothing to address directly the mountain of debt that
the utilities have accumulated. PG&E and Southern California Edison owe banks
and energy companies billions.
"We're still going through the proposed decisions and would like to wait
until we have fully analyzed the material before we comment on it," said Ron
Low, a spokesman for PG&E.
By raising rates, state regulators would lessen the severity of blackouts
this summer but would probably not prevent them entirely, according to
industry groups.
"In any circumstance, we're going to have a very difficult summer," said Jan
Smutny-Jones, director of the Independent Energy Producers Association. "It's
too early to say how sufficient it is, but it (the commission's willingness
to raise rates) is an important recognition of reality."
Lynch acknowledged the measures will only partly address electricity
problems.
She called on federal regulators to impose regionwide caps on the wholesale
electricity market and order more refunds when prices have been unreasonably
high.
If the commission adopts the rate hike today, its next step will be to
determine who pays what portion.

Power rate hike reaction mixed
Wall Street likes proposal, but local business leaders have some misgivings
BY RICK JURGENS
TIMES STAFF WRITER
The electricity rate hike proposed Monday by the state's top utility
regulator elicited cheers on Wall Street, where the prices of California
utility stocks rose about 30 percent, but got a more cautious reaction from
local business leaders.
"This is a regrettable necessity," said Justin Bradley, energy program
director for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, a San Jose-based group
of 190 technology employers.
A rate hike won't in itself solve the state's electricity crisis, said Bruce
Kern, executive director of the Economic Development Alliance for Business in
Oakland. Reliability is the key business concern about electricity, and
restoring reliability will require more generating capacity and conservation
assistance for companies, he said.
Despite a surge in wholesale electricity costs since April 2000, California
regulators have allowed only a 9 percent increase in retail prices and Gov.
Gray Davis has adamantly rejected calls for further rate hikes. But Public
Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch, a Davis appointee, signaled
that the administration may be ready to retreat with a plan to hike the
average retail price by 3 cents a kilowatt hour. That would be a 46 percent
increase over the current average rate in the PG&E service area of 6.4 cents
a kilowatt hour, excluding distribution and other costs not directly related
to power procurement.
That didn't faze Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of
Commerce. "We have looked at it as inevitable for some time," he said of the
rate hike. Higher natural gas costs, along with the dry winter that reduced
the availability of hydroelectric power throughout the West, were bound to
boost retail bills, he said.
Bradley, speaking for tech manufacturers, said Lynch's plan promises to stem
the tide of state agency spending on electricity, direct some revenue toward
small generators and put some downward pressure on wholesale prices but is
only one step toward a long-term solution. "We need an overall philosophy and
strategy to restore normalcy to this market," he said.
Lynch, who described her offering as "merely a proposal to jumpstart the
public process of rate design," included as a "principle" plans to narrow the
gap between residential rates and those of industrial users, whose average
bill now logs in at about 3 cents a kilowatt hour less. Lynch suggested that
that differential be shaved by about a penny an hour.
That isn't the direction that Kern would like to see things move. "Our main
concern would be that if there is a rate increase it be (done) equitably and
not disproportionately affect business in this region," he said. "We're
beginning to hear employers say, 'Maybe it's just too costly to do business
here,'" he warned.
Higher electricity rates might force price increase and a cutback in
expansion plans at Helios Farms Nursery in Brentwood, which runs electric
water pumps for up to eight hours a day during the summer. "It's too soon to
tell the affect" of the rate increase, said Maria Orfanos, one of the owners.
"We'll have to see what happens this summer. We need to water the plants."
But rate hikes promise to remove the cloud of debt -- billions of dollars
worth -- that now hovers over the utilities. The gap between high wholesale
prices and fixed retail rates cost PG&E as much as $4.1 billion in after-tax
profits during 2000, the company said in a securities filing Monday. But that
didn't seem to bother investors, whose heavy buying made California utilities
among the stock market's big gainers Monday. PG&E's stock closed at $13.75,
up $3.10 or 29.1 percent, and Edison International, Southern California's
largest electricity seller, closed at $14.55, up $3.35 or 29.9 percent.
Edison issued a late-day response to Lynch's move that seemed designed to
dampen investors' enthusiasm. "A cursory review of the multiple complex
proposals suggests that substantial improvements will be needed if they are
to fully align costs with rates and restore the creditworthiness of the
state's utilities in the eyes of the financial community," it said. Edison
also called for the PUC to allow "flexibility to meet unknown future shifts
in the costs of generation."
A PG&E spokesman said the company was still analyzing the "inch-thick stack
of materials" and had no comment. An earlier PUC proposal to require the
utility to pay small generators would leave the utility with "insufficient
revenues ... to recover the cost of its own generation" and to pay other
contracted generators, it said in its filing.
Kern, the EDAB chief, said he was encouraged by the state's plan to issue
industrial revenue bonds to finance stand-by generators for businesses and to
install energy-efficient lighting.

State proposes electric rate hike: PUC suggests 30 percent average increase;
industry hit hardest
By Carrie Peyton and Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writers
(Published March 27, 2001)
The wildfires sweeping California's electric market burned through to
consumers' wallets Monday, with a proposal that appeared virtually certain to
boost overall rates roughly 30 percent.
Some customers, including households that use little electricity, could be
spared entirely, while others, including some of the state's biggest
manufacturers, could see increases of close to 90 percent.
It would be the biggest rate increase in state history, and there is no
guarantee it would be enough to resolve California's electricity crisis,
state-funded ratepayer watchdogs said.
While Gov. Gray Davis sought to distance himself from the proposal, industry
observers said it stretched credulity to imagine his appointees to the state
Public Utilities Commission would have gone against his wishes.
"Anyone who wants to claim this isn't part of his plan is going to fly in the
face of everything he's told us. It's just not likely," said Camden Collins,
a Bay Area energy consultant who has held high-level posts with the PUC and
the state grid operator.
After a weekend marathon of last-minute calculations, the PUC issued a
wide-ranging, sometimes contradictory package of proposals Monday for
probable commission votes today.
In one of the biggest conflicts, a PUC administrative judge who oversaw rate
hearings urged no increase at all, while commission President Loretta Lynch,
who leads a Davis-picked PUC majority, urged a hike of 3 cents per
kilowatt-hour.
Other key proposals include:
Making permanent a temporary 9 percent - 1 cent per kilowatt-hour - rate hike
imposed in January for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison.
Starting immediate discussions on designing rates that would fall hardest on
the heaviest users, changes that could appear in May electric bills.
Revising the formula for paying alternative power producers, known as
"qualifying facilities," in a way that several said still wouldn't solve a
simmering payment dispute.
Creating a formula for utilities to pay the state for electricity purchases
made on their behalf since January, which appears to clear the way for the
state to issue power purchase bonds.
Reclassifying past debts and expenses to sharply cut utilities' estimates of
their losses - a move sought by consumer groups.
Consumer groups blasted the proposal, investors welcomed it, and utilities
were cautious, with PG&E declining immediate comment and Edison saying it
still didn't go far enough. Generators and economists labeled it a good first
step.
"We have unfortunately come to the conclusion that a rate increase is
needed," Lynch said. "It's time to pay the power bills for California."
Customers of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District would not be affected,
although it is considering its own 16 percent rate hike, also driven by
skyrocketing wholesale costs.
Lynch's proposal would let PG&E collect an extra $2.3 billion annually from
customers, increasing PG&E's system average rate from 10.4 to 13.4 cents a
kilowatt-hour. That comes on top of January's 1-cent average increase, for a
total rate hike this year of more than 40 percent.
But individual rates could play out very differently. Some people would
escape entirely, including those on special low-income rates and residential
customers whose electricity use falls below a state-set threshold. Companies
big enough to own their own substations could face hikes of 87 percent;
agricultural consumers, 10 percent to 24 percent; and other businesses, 41
percent to 58 percent.
"Electricity hogs will have to pay more," Lynch said.
For his part, Davis told reporters in Los Angeles, "As governor, I have not
decided there should be a rate increase, and as governor, I have not decided
that tiered pricing makes sense."
Although Davis has appointed three of the PUC's five commissioners, he said
"I can't order or direct an independent body."
Davis' top staff members, however, have been in close communication with the
commission. Industrial groups indicated the governor's staff was discussing
nearly identical rate hikes last week.
Michael Shames, head of the San Diego-based Utility Consumers' Action
Network, said, "This PUC doesn't do anything of this substance without the
governor's approval."
If they pass today, Lynch said, the new rate increases should be enough to
pay the qualifying facilities and the state for power that is produced or
purchased from now on. Still unresolved is whether additional rate hikes will
be needed to cover billions that utilities say they are owed for past
purchases.
Several executives of the qualifying facilities said the plan wouldn't pay
them enough.
"I don't think it works," said Dean Vanech, president of Delta Power Co.,
which runs five gas-fired cogeneration plants in California. Four have been
closed because of lack of payment. "We'd lose money marginally on every
kilowatt we produce," he said.
Still, many in the private sector saw Lynch's statement as a sign that
progress was being made.
Investors drove both utilities' shares up nearly 30 percent. Edison
International rose $3.35 to $14.55. PG&E Corp. was up $3.10 to $13.75.
Stephen Levy, senior economist with the Center for Continuing Study of the
California Economy, said he thinks the state can weather the rate increase.
"Last year California absorbed a 50 percent increase in the cost of gasoline
with no appreciable effect," Levy said.
Although California's economy will slow this year, it will be the result of
the national malaise and the troubles in the technology sector, not energy
costs, Levy said.
But the top increases will hit hard at businesses, including "cement, steel,
a lot of high tech, anybody in manufacturing," said Carolyn Kehrein, a
consultant to commercial power users. Some will flee the state, and many
others will either raise their own prices or cut back on salaries, she said.
In two hours of testimony before the PUC after the proposals were unveiled,
utility and consumer lawyers alternately praised and shredded them.
Noting utilities' last proposal was for a lower increase, Robert Finkelstein,
attorney for The Utility Reform Network, said, "You're surpassing their
wildest dreams. That's very, very disturbing."
The Lynch plan relies heavily on a state bond offering to finance a major
portion of the Department of Water Resources' electricity purchases. In doing
so, "we are borrowing against the future to pay the extremely high rates of
today," said Severin Borenstein of the University of California Energy
Institute in Berkeley. "We're just paying it on an installment plan instead
of paying all right now."
But he said massive, immediate rate hikes could shock California into a
recession. "We're doing a balancing act," he said.

Cox new minority leader in GOP coup: Assembly conservatives want to flex
energy muscle
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 27, 2001)
Assembly Republicans staged a two-hour coup Monday that ended with Sacramento
County's Dave Cox being named minority floor leader, a move sparked by
conservatives pushing for a more confrontational approach to the energy
crisis.
Cox, of Fair Oaks, vowed to be more "aggressive and proactive" on energy
issues. He declined to comment on reports that his predecessor, Bill Campbell
of Villa Park, was dumped in part because he was working too closely with
Democrats.
"We don't want to talk about individual personalities," Cox said when asked
why Campbell was replaced after less than five months in the leadership post.
"We don't want to sensationalize it. It's a family matter. We'll handle it in
the family."
Cox, 63, who is the sixth Assembly Republican leader since late 1995, has
significant experience in the energy field. He served for four years on the
Sacramento Municipal Utility District's governing board, and later spent six
years as a Sacramento County supervisor before joining the Assembly in 1998.
Under his leadership, Cox said, Republicans will articulate an energy crisis
"game plan" and specific measures to help generate adequate power supplies by
2004.
Although Republicans hold only 29 seats in the 80-member Assembly, Cox said
that does not mean the party has no control over legislation.
"You have as much power as you think you have," he said.
Privately, Assembly Republicans said Cox's selection was driven by a feeling
that they need to further distance themselves from Gov. Gray Davis' power
plans and by several key energy-related developments within the past week:
The Legislature is bracing to vote on separate bills that would provide
long-term contracts for alternative energy providers and would set the stage
for California to market billions in bonds to buy electricity in years to
come.
Both those votes require a two-thirds majority to take effect immediately,
meaning that at least five Republicans would have to join with Democrats in
supporting the measures. Republicans feel that situation gives them leverage,
and many want a tough leader negotiating on the party's behalf.
At a party caucus late last week, many Republicans were upset by the
Democrats' decision to place both key energy issues - and a third that would
extend an existing rate cap to large San Diego businesses - into a single
bill, AB 8x.
Assembly Republicans adamantly opposed that single-bill strategy but were
placed in an awkward political position - they could either swallow their
philosophical opposition or vote against the bill and take the blame if
blackouts resulted.
As Republicans debated the issue in tense party caucuses, Campbell commented
that he thought the Democrats' bill would pass. Opponents were livid. He
later said he did not support AB 8x and was simply providing "cover" for
colleagues who planned to vote "yes."
Republicans ultimately voted as a bloc against AB 8x and demanded that all
three issues be considered in separate bills. Assembly leaders negotiated
throughout the weekend, but the issues remain unresolved.
During last week's tense party caucuses, Assemblyman Dennis Mountjoy,
R-Monrovia, reportedly criticized Campbell for leadership weaknesses.
Campbell lost his temper, adding momentum to a growing feeling of frustration
within the caucus, sources said.
Campbell said Monday that he doubts that the confrontation with Mountjoy
played a major role in his removal. "That was just a case where things
happened and I apologized to Dennis. He said, 'It didn't bother me, I have a
thick skin.' "
Asked if he had any regrets about his service as Republican leader, Campbell
said simply that he has enjoyed the post and did his best during the "wild
ride" of this year's energy crisis.
"I'd like to still be the leader - but I'm not," he said.
Republican sources said opposition to Campbell's leadership has been growing
since January, when he voted to support AB 1x, which committed the state to
enter the power-buying market in a big way and spend billions for long-term
energy contracts.
Campbell, after seeing that he lacked support Monday, decided to step down
rather than spark a divisive fight to retain the post. Sources said Cox held
about twice as much support within the caucus as Campbell.
Ultimately, support from Republican conservatives led by Tony Strickland,
R-Thousand Oaks, provided the margin of victory for Cox.
The vote marked a turnabout for Strickland's group, which sided with Campbell
when he was elected over Cox in November.
Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San Bernardino, said it's too soon to tell
whether Monday's vote will leave Assembly Republicans deeply divided.
"It could mean less unity, it could mean more," he said. "It really depends
on Dave Cox's ability to pull the caucus together."
GOP political consultant Wayne Johnson said he thinks term limits were a
factor in the caucus' impatience with Campbell.
"Everybody knows they're not here for very long, and when you're here during
what is becoming somewhat of a crisis environment, people want to be a little
more proactive," Johnson said.
Ray McNally, a Republican Party consultant, called Campbell an "energy
casualty."
Under Cox, he said, Assembly Republicans will be "more aggressive in
presenting alternatives," and Cox will "work harder to show the differences
in approaches to solving the energy problem."

Dan Walters: An absolutely incredible tale


(Published March 27, 2001)
From the onset of his governorship two-plus years ago, Gray Davis has
insisted, by both public words and private acts, that he and he alone would
make his administration's major policy decisions.
Legislators and lobbyists have complained that no one in Davis' office was
empowered to give an up or down signal on pending legislation, and
administration officials have recounted grimly - and very privately - tales
about Davis' insistence on deciding even minuscule policy matters. The
governor once castigated one of his Cabinet appointees before her colleagues
in the harshest possible language for making an environmental policy change
without his approval. The most routine action by a state agency is trumpeted
through the governor's media office. Davis has even joked about his
micromanagerial tendencies.
It is, therefore, utterly incredible - in the precise meaning of the word -
that Davis' handpicked president of the state Public Utilities Commission, a
former political adviser, would raise electric power rates by billions of
dollars without clearing it through Davis. Yet that's what the governor's
mouthpiece asserts.
On Monday, PUC President Loretta Lynch - acknowledging what anyone with half
a brain knew weeks ago - declared that power rates would have to jump
sharply. She is proposing an increase of three cents a kilowatt-hour, about
40 percent, in areas served by private utilities to cover the massive costs
associated with the current crisis, with a "tiered" structure to impose most
of the burden on high- volume power users.
Even Lynch was fudging, however, when she insisted that the boost - from
about seven cents a kilowatt-hour to 10 cents - would be "all that is needed
going forward." In fact, as anyone who can do simple arithmetic can
calculate, it's only the beginning of a series of rate jumps that will be
needed to cover past debts and current wholesale costs. It's not improbable
that ultimately, rates will double (not counting another nickel a
kilowatt-hour that's imposed for delivery and other costs).
Lynch's public statement came just three days after Davis' aides briefed key
legislators on the likelihood of sharp rate boosts. Throughout, however,
Davis' spokesmen have insisted that the governor was not supporting such
increases and continues to believe that the supply and price crunches can be
handled "within the existing rate structure," as one euphemistic version put
it.
The latest spin was issued by Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, after
Lynch's statement. "The governor has not had conversations with any (utility)
commissioners about a potential rate hike," the Maviglio statement said. "It
is still his hope and expectation that this matter can be resolved within the
existing rate structure."
Clearly, the governor, who has been so insistent on doing things his way - a
tendency bordering on obsessive-compulsive behavior - has gone into the
bunker on this one, allowing Lynch to take the heat from consumer groups,
which immediately denounced the proposed rate increase as a giveaway to the
utilities.
It's cowardly, especially because the current crisis is largely a product of
dithering by Davis and Lynch last summer when the first price-supply problems
appeared. Had they acted forthrightly then, with such steps as long-term
supply contracts, it would have been a relatively minor bump rather than a
full-blown disaster that threatens the state's business climate and its
solvency and will cause financial pain for Californians.
If California needs a utility rate increase, so be it. But we Californians
would appreciate not being treated like children who need sugarcoating for
the bad-tasting medicine. And we'd also appreciate not having our
intelligence insulted with fairy tales from the Governor's Office.

Daniel Weintraub: No crisis is big enough to slow Davis' fund spree


(Published March 27, 2001)
If Gov. Gray Davis' potential opponents wanted to invent an anecdote to use
against him when he runs for re-election next year, they couldn't do any
better than the one he handed them Friday.
While lawmakers desperately in need of leadership deadlocked on crucial
legislation to help solve California's energy crisis, Davis was at a Palm
Springs country club and golf course, raising money to add to his campaign
committee's already record-shattering $26 million bank balance.
The governor's spokesman assures us that Davis did not actually play golf
Friday. He merely stopped by the fund-raiser because he had some time to kill
between a morning groundbreaking ceremony and an afternoon television
interview.
Right. Davis may have been in Palm Springs on state business, but it's
curious that, wherever he goes, this governor always seems to find a way to
raise some money. Even if he didn't play golf, the incident drives home the
image of a governor so preoccupied with his own re-election that he can't
stay on-task in Sacramento to work on what is arguably the biggest crisis any
California politician has ever faced.
While Davis was rubbing shoulders with wealthy supporters in the desert, his
staff and some investment bankers were briefing lawmakers on just how bad the
energy crisis has become. The state may need to borrow $23 billion before
it's over, the bankers said, not the $10 billion that the governor has
publicly announced. And the idea of keeping the lights on without further
rate increases - a mantra to which Davis has clung against all reason - is a
fantasy. Rates will have to rise, perhaps double, to get us out of this,
according to the governor's staff. You cannot forever buy a dollar's worth of
power, they are saying, with 50 cents.
This is incredible stuff, especially coming from the governor's own people.
But what's even more astounding is that this news was delivered to the
Legislature, and thus the public, before Davis himself was fully briefed.
Davis is not only out of town, it turns out. He's out of touch. Of course, we
didn't need Friday's fund-raiser to figure that out.
Last week, to put it mildly, was a bad one for the governor, whom critics
have begun to call the prince of darkness. It began with two days of rolling
blackouts that would not have happened but for Davis' inattention to a
problem that threatened to shut down between 10 percent and 20 percent of the
state's already short power supply. Alternative energy producers, including
cogeneration plants that produce electricity as a byproduct of a
manufacturing operation, were going dark because they weren't getting paid
for their electricity and could no longer afford to buy the fuel that fires
their plants.
It has been widely known for months that the utilities weren't paying these
power producers. The Legislature has been working on a measure to get them
paid and lower their rates by roughly half. It's a very important part of any
comprehensive solution to the crisis. But after the blackouts hit, Davis
acted as if he'd only just discovered the problem. He was outraged. He said
it was "immoral" for the utilities to collect money from ratepayers and not
pay their suppliers.
But that was only the beginning. The battle over getting the small energy
producers paid led to questions about how the state would be paid for the
power purchases Davis has been making since January on behalf of the
utilities. Davis intends to float a bond measure - public borrowing - to
reimburse the state's general fund for the $4 billion-plus that the emergency
buys are costing taxpayers. The bond is supposed to be retired by dedicating
a share of future electricity rates to repayment. For the transaction to
work, the bond buyers insist on getting first call on the money collected by
the utilities.
The law Davis signed in January when he started buying the power was supposed
to put the state, and its bond partners, at the front of the line for the
utilities' cash. But the utilities, particularly Pacific Gas & Electric,
don't think the law does that. And Davis apparently failed to get their
signature on an IOU before he put taxpayers on the hook to save the companies
from bankruptcy.
These are rather large details to miss for a guy who has a reputation as a
control freak and a micromanager. But they are part of a pattern stretching
back to last summer, when Davis brushed off early warnings about the
potential depths of the crisis he was even then trying to avoid. More and
more he gives the impression of a man not so much trying to resolve the
energy crisis but of one who is thinking first, and foremost, about saving
his own political skin. The problem is, the more he focuses on his own
prospects, the worse they become.
It would be nice if Davis would suspend his political money-grubbing for a
few weeks and work full-time on the business he was elected to do. But then
again, maybe he should schedule even more fund-raisers: The way things are
going, come re-election time, he is going to need every penny he can get.

Energy woes give nuclear plants a life




Crisis offers second chance to all-but-discarded industry
By Bruce Lieberman
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
March 26, 2001
A group of nuclear power advocates and energy experts gathered in an
auditorium in Irvine last month to discuss "Nuclear Power: The Option for the
21st century?"
Their talk was upbeat.
Even asking that question would have been laughable five years ago.
In 1996, California was heading toward a deregulated electricity market. The
commercial nuclear power industry was heading toward extinction.
No way could it compete with coal and natural gas fired plants in a
deregulated market. Never would a utility invest billions of dollars to build
a nuclear power plant when it had no guarantee of recovering that investment
through customer rates, which the architects of deregulation said would only
fall.
No one had ordered a nuclear power plant in this country since 1978, the year
before a partial meltdown at the Three Mile Island plant and eight years
before a nuclear reactor blew up at Chernobyl.
Political support for nuclear power was all but dead, and electric utilities
in the United States knew it.
That was then.
Today, the country's nuclear power industry is looking at California's
troubled experiment with electricity deregulation, environmental concerns
over global warming and an unyielding demand for electricity -- and they see
one thing:
Opportunity.
"I'm extremely optimistic about the future of nuclear power in the U.S.,"
Corbin A. McNeill, Jr., chairman and co-chief executive officer of utility
giant Exelon Corp., told the Irvine symposium.
Nuclear power advocates across the country say the industry is safer, more
efficient and more economically viable than ever before.
"I personally believe there will be a new generation of nuclear power plants
in this country," said Ray Golden, a spokesman for Southern California
Edison's nuclear power plant at San Onofre. "It's a function of when."
Late last month, Senate Republicans introduced an energy bill that could lead
to more nuclear power plants.
The National Energy Security Act, introduced by Sen. Frank Murkowski of
Alaska, would give a big boost to the industry. It would provide nearly $1
billion in research and development money, financial rewards for operators
who make nuclear power plants more efficient, and industrywide tax breaks.
Critics say the bill would just give taxpayer support to a dying industry.
"Clamoring for new subsidies doesn't help the industry make the case that it
is now economically competitive and poised for a resurgence," said
Christopher Sherry, research director for the Safe Energy Communication
Council, a coalition of environmental groups founded after the 1979 accident
at Three Mile Island.
New lease on life
Two primary changes in the nuclear power industry have given advocates reason
to be optimistic.
First, commercial power plants have become more efficient.
The Nuclear Energy Institute, the industry-backed trade association in
Washington, estimates that improvements in output at the nation's 103
commercial nuclear reactors have added the equivalent of about 25 1,000
megawatt-reactors.
The industry, matured by decades of experience, has improved safety and
shortened routine shutdowns for refueling and maintenance. Electricity
production costs are at an all-time low, at 1.83 cents per kilowatt-hour
(down from 3.12 cents in 1987), making nuclear energy competitive with coal
and natural gas, according to the institute.
Second, the federal government has begun extending operating licenses for
nuclear reactors.
Since last March, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has extended the 40-year
operating licenses for five reactors an additional 20 years. The operators of
five more reactors have applied for license extensions, and an additional 28
are expected to seek extensions within the next five years, the institute
said.
Southern California Edison has not decided whether it will seek a license
extension for San Onofre's two remaining reactors, Units 2 and 3, Golden
said. Both are scheduled to be shut down in 2022.
In those reactors that obtain license extensions, utilities see new value,
and a profitable future.
Environmentalists see an avoidable danger.
Public Citizen, Ralph Nader's consumer advocate group, has called extending a
nuclear power plant's license a "high-stakes gamble" that risks safety in
aging plants.
Critical components in a nuclear power plant, including the reactor pressure
vessel that holds nuclear fuel and the thousands of steam generator tubes
that circulate heated and irradiated water, endure extreme stresses and
degrade over time.
"There was a reason (the nation's nuclear power plants) originally had
40-year licenses," said Scott Denman, executive director of the Safe Energy
Communication Council.
New sales, new worries
With license extensions, nuclear power plants are now seen by buyers as
profit centers. Six commercial nuclear reactors have been sold since
mid-1999, and the sale of eight reactors is pending, according to the Nuclear
Energy Institute.
The merger of several big utilities has consolidated ownership of commercial
nuclear reactors. The marriage of Commonwealth Edison-Unicom in Illinois and
PECO Energy Co. in Pennsylvania in October created Exelon Corp. and placed 17
reactors under one corporate roof.
McNeill, of Exelon, said the consolidation is creating tremendous economies
of scale that are bringing down operating costs.
Critics worry about a new rivalry between utilities that operate the plants.
"Electricity deregulation sets up a direct competition between power plants,
potentially compromising the safe operation of nuclear power plants as owners
attempt to minimize operation and maintenance costs while maximizing
electricity production and sales," Public Citizen has written.
The environmental group argues that a Feb. 3 electrical fire in the turbine
room of San Onofre's Unit 3 reactor, which occurred as workers were
re-starting the reactor after a routine refueling and maintenance outage,
shows that the industry is not as reliable as advocates would like the public
to believe. Damage caused by the failed circuit breaker that caused the fire
will keep the 1,100-megawatt reactor shut down through mid-May.
"The NRC and the nuclear industry have been skimping on maintenance during
refueling to improve the profitability of nuclear reactors," said Public
Citizen's Jim Riccio, senior policy analyst for the group's Critical Mass
Energy and Environment Program.
Yet, according to reports the company filed Feb. 16 with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Southern California Edison, the majority owner of the
San Onofre plant, will lose between $80 million and $100 million because of
the Feb. 3 fire.
That comes at a rough time for the cash-strapped utility.
The San Onofre nuclear power plant is the company's most important asset at a
time when it is near bankruptcy because of skyrocketing electricity costs
from out-of-state power generators.
"San Onofre is the only thing that makes the company money," Golden said.
State's nuclear future
California, the most populous state in the country and the world's sixth
largest economy, has four nuclear reactors -- two at San Onofre and two at
the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant near San Luis Obispo. Yet, those four
nuclear reactors generate more than 4,000 megawatts of electricity, nearly 18
percent of the electricity generated in California.
A third plant, Rancho Seco, near Sacramento, was shut down in 1989 when
voters demanded its closure. Opponents said it was badly run.
Yet, so desperate are state legislators to find sources of power that at
least one has discussed turning Rancho Seco back on. On Feb. 22, state Sen.
Tom McClintock, R-Thousand Oaks, introduced a bill to study whether the state
should buy Rancho Seco.
McClintock said the plant could be put back into service in nine months for
$500 million. And, with new turbines, the plant could increase its production
of electricity from 800 megawatts to 1,100 megawatts -- enough power for more
than a million people.
McClintock acknowledges there is little enthusiasm in the state Legislature
for embracing nuclear energy as one answer to California's energy crisis.
"Politically, they're scared to death of it," he said.
John. P. Holdren, a professor of environmental policy at Harvard's John F.
Kennedy School of Government, said the high cost of building nuclear power
plants likely will keep the industry from expanding in the short term.
In the longer term, though, Holdren said nuclear energy could offer a real
alternative to fossil fuels and thereby help combat global warming.
In testimony to Congress last June, he outlined several conditions that must
be met before the nuclear energy production can expand. Among them were some
high hurdles:
The industry must become competitive with other alternative energy sources
that do not emit carbon into the atmosphere, such as hydro-electric power.
Nuclear power plants around the world must prove they are safe.
The nation must find a permanent repository for nuclear waste and build
temporary storage facilities until one opens.
Research into reprocessing used nuclear fuel, which produces a form of
plutonium that could be used in nuclear weapons, should be suspended.
Nuclear energy must gain widespread public acceptance.
New breed
If any power company debuts the next generation of nuclear power plants in
the United States, it may very well be Exelon Corp.
The company is helping to finance research in South Africa into a new type of
nuclear reactor, called the "pebble bed modular reactor." The 110-megawatt
reactor, about a tenth the size of conventional nuclear reactors in the
United States, would be designed to eliminate the risk of a meltdown, backers
say.
Passive safety features would eliminate the need for redundant back-up
systems, containment structures and off-site emergency plants, drastically
cutting costs. Because of their modular design, additional reactors could be
added at a single site. McNeill said the new technology could be imported to
the United States and Europe within the next few years.
"A typical plant should be able to generate a kilowatt of electricity for
less than a penny," he said.
Environmental groups have been extremely critical of the design, saying that
it needs some type of containment structure, such as the concrete domes at
San Onofre, to keep radiation from escaping into the atmosphere should
disaster strike.
Meanwhile, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission has approved three designs for
other, more conventional reactors.
McClintock said it's only a matter of time before politicians and the public
re-think their positions on nuclear energy.
The legislator predicts that a shift in opinions will come this summer, when
projections by the California Independent System Operator show that
electricity supply shortages will force blackouts on 6 million people.
"By the time the state has survived the summer of 2001," McClintock said, "as
a practical matter, we'll be forced to take a new look at nuclear energy.
... It is going to be a very ugly, ugly awakening for a lot of politicians
who sat around and did nothing."

Top state power regulator proposes 40 percent rate increase




By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 26, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) California's top power regulator proposed a 40 percent hike
in electricity rates Monday, saying such an increase should encourage
customers to cut back on usage and conserve enough power to get through the
hot summer months.
Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities Commission, said rates
should increase by an average of 3 cents per kilowatt hour. The current rate
averages 7.5 cents per kilowatt hour.
The higher rates could go into effect as early as Tuesday, when the PUC
meets. Lynch and two other members of the five-member PUC were appointed by
Gov. Gray Davis, and Lynch's proposal is expected to be approved by the
commission.
Lynch, who repeatedly refused to characterize the hike as a 40 percent
increase, said the increase was needed to avoid significant power problems
this summer.
"That number should be all that is needed going forward," she said at a news
conference, "to keep utilities solvent and ensure that the treasurer of the
state can issue bonds."
Lynch's proposal is at odds with that of administrative law judge Christine
Walwyn, who recently advised the PUC that rate increases were not necessary.
Any increase would be on top of the 9 percent to 15 percent rate increase the
PUC approved in January, and an additional 10 percent increase already
scheduled for next year.
Lynch also supports a "tiered" rate system that would charge residential and
businesses customers more if they're large users and fail to cut back, a move
aimed at encouraging conservation.
The governor repeatedly has said he is confident the state's power crisis can
be resolved without further rate hikes. But Davis aides have concluded that
rates must rise, given that wholesale power costs remain high. Several
lawmakers, including Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg, have said a rate
increase is inevitable.
"It's obvious to me that unless you rob a bank or win a lottery you are not
going to be able to do this without raising rates," Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton, D-San Francisco, said Monday.
Southern California Edison Co. and Pacific Gas & Electric Co. both have
pushed for further rate increases, and PG&E has said its current rates would
be insufficient to cover its bills and the state's.
Administration officials have been negotiating with PG&E, Edison and San
Diego Gas & Electric about purchasing the utilities' transmission lines to
give the companies cash to pay their bills.
PG&E and Edison say they've lost more than $13 billion since last summer due
to high wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996 deregulation law
prevents them from collecting from their customers.

Supplier Duke offers to forego some charges




By Leslie Gornstein
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 26, 2001
LOS ANGELES ) A North Carolina energy supplier offered Monday to slice nearly
$20 million off California's emergency power bill for January and February if
its debtors agree to pay.
Under increasing pressure from state and federal regulators, Duke Energy
offered to forego part of what it charged for power during Stage 3 alerts in
January and February.
The power went to California's Independent System Operator, which runs 75
percent of the state's power grid, and to the now-defunct Power Exchange.
North Carolina-based Duke offered to drop $19.8 million in so-called "credit
premiums," but only after the two entities agree to pay $273 per megawatt
hour for power supplied in January and $430 per megawatt hour in February.
ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson refused to comment on the offer.
Duke has not been paid for any power sent to California in January and
February, spokesman Tom Williams said Monday.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said recently that $273 in January
and $430 in February were the highest rates that any supplier could charge
without triggering suspicion of gouging.
Williams would not say how often Duke's rates exceeded those caps during the
two months, nor would he say how many megawatt hours Duke sold to California
during the stretch.
But he did admit Duke often charged more than those rates. He called the
additional charges "credit premiums" ) typical fees within the industry.
Suppliers often charge customers more if they have bad credit or suspect they
will be unable to pay.
FERC has said that Duke potentially owes California $21.14 million in
overcharges for the first two months of the year.
The company's offer was not meant to be an admission of price gouging,
Williams said.
"We have not been paid a dime," Williams said. "It is not unusual to have
credit premiums."
Duke, along with Reliant Energy Services, Dynegy Power Marketing Inc.,
Williams Energy Services Corp., Mirant and Portland General Electric, may
have overcharged California by as much as $125 million in January and
February, FERC has said.
Since the state's power crisis erupted, power at times has cost 15 to 20
times more than it did a year ago.
Before the energy crisis started, electricity was selling at an average
wholesale cost of $30 a megawatt hour.
The crisis stems from 1995 state laws attempting to deregulate the California
power market. The attempt has been criticized for sinking the utilities,
trapping them between state-mandated price caps and soaring electricity
prices on the open market.

PUC to Vote on Big Rate Hike; OK Is Likely

Electricity: Agency chief urges a boost of about 40% for many, and calls it
necessary to raise cash and encourage conservation. Higher cost could show up
in May bills.

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers

SAN FRANCISCO--Millions of Californians would see electricity rates rise
by about 40% under a plan presented Monday by the state's top power regulator.
Loretta Lynch, president of California's Public Utilities Commission,
called rate hikes necessary both to raise cash and to encourage conservation.
Her plan would charge some customers of the state's two biggest private
utilities 3 cents more per kilowatt-hour, depending on how much electricity
they consume. The higher cost would show up in May power bills.
Lynch promised to target the increases on heavy users of electricity and
spare nearly half of residential customers from paying more. The commission
is scheduled to vote on her proposal today, and it is almost certain to win
approval, according to commissioners.
It would cost customers of Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas &
Electric a total of $4.8 billion a year.
San Diego Gas & Electric is not covered by the proposed rate hikes,
though officials there said their utility should be.
Nor would the increases affect the customers of municipally owned
utilities in Los Angeles, Riverside, Pasadena, Anaheim and elsewhere.
Lynch's proposal drew fire from consumer advocates, sighs of resignation
from lawmakers and enthusiasm from Wall Street. Stock prices for both
companies jumped by nearly one-third.
For renters and homeowners, the proposal could cost nothing or as much
as 40% more per month. Business customers--who now pay lower rates--could see
even higher increases.
The latest proposed increase would come on top of an average 10% rate
hike for all users imposed in January, which would become permanent under
Lynch's plan. An additional 10% increase for residential and small business
users is already scheduled for this time next year.
"We recognize the utilities are in severe financial distress," Lynch
said. "For utilities to keep the lights on, we unfortunately came to the
conclusion a rate increase was needed."
Commissioner Geoffrey Brown, recently appointed by Davis, predicted that
the plan will pass. Commissioner Richard Bilas, a Republican appointed by
former Gov. Pete Wilson, would not say whether he would vote for Lynch's
proposal but said "rates need to go up."
Davis, who named three of the five commissioners, distanced himself
Monday from the PUC action, saying that it's an independent body. He repeated
that it is his expectation that rate increases can be avoided.
"I've not seen enough information to persuade me we need a rate hike,"
the governor said at a news conference after speaking to students at Walt
Disney Elementary School in Burbank.
If the increase is approved today, Lynch said, it will be refined in the
30 days it takes the utilities to change their billing processes. The rate
increase would be subject to refund if it is more than enough to cover costs
of energy purchases.
Lynch said she cannot finalize the proposal until she gets more
information about power supply and cost projections from the California
Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of
the nearly bankrupt utilities in mid-January. That's when some generators
refused to sell to the utilities for fear of not getting paid.

Utilities Earned Substantial Profits
The utilities have been burdened by wholesale electricity prices that
have topped 10 times the levels of those a year ago.
Rising demand for electricity across the West, plus fundamental flaws in
the design of the deregulated market that California opened in 1998, have
allowed sellers of electricity to earn substantial profits. Since the state
stepped in to buy electricity for the utilities, it has spent about $3
billion covering roughly 34% of the state's power needs.
While Davis has adamantly resisted rate hikes, other politicians have
come to call increases inevitable. The state and utilities need a better cash
flow to cover wholesale power costs expected to soar again this summer, they
say.
And rate boosts will serve another critical purpose, they say, by
prompting Californians to switch off lights, buy efficient refrigerators and
shut down hot tubs. Such conservation will be crucial in whether the state
avoids blackouts, grid operators say.
"If it is tiered right, it wouldn't break my heart," Senate President
Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said, adding that he expects that any
increase will exempt low-income people.
Lynch said repeatedly that the 3-cent-per-kilowatt-hour hike she
proposed should be all that is necessary to allow the state and utilities to
keep buying electricity. The more than $13 billion the utilities claim they
are owed for power purchases since May must be resolved through negotiations
between the governor's office and the utilities, she said.
The Legislature already has approved a bill guaranteeing that those who
use 30% more than their minimal allocation, known as the baseline, won't feel
the hikes.
The baseline is a certain amount of electricity--50% to 60% of the
average residential use per month--that varies regionally, so that a
homeowner in the desert has a higher baseline amount than one living on the
temperate coast. Electricity consumed up to the baseline amount costs less.
Last year, Edison customers paid 6.2 cents per kilowatt-hour for
electricity. (The average home uses about 700 to 1,000 kilowatt-hours per
month.) The PUC raised that rate to 7.2 cents in January, and Lynch's
proposal would boost it to 10.2 cents.
Edison customers also pay an additional 5.25 cents for distribution,
billing and other costs on top of the electricity charge.
Lynch projects that under her plan about half of Edison's households
would have no monthly bill increases, one-fifth would have an 8% increase,
and fewer than about one-third of the households would have a 27% increase.
Rather than welcome the potential rate hikes, Edison officials said they
were frustrated that the PUC proposal does not guarantee that the higher
rates will cover all of the utility's and the state's costs.
"It helps, but it doesn't solve the problem," said John R. Fielder, a
senior vice president at Edison. "And it's really vulnerable because if it's
not enough, then what do you do?"
Fielder pointed out that when Edison argued for higher rates in
December, it was turned down, causing the utility to accumulate additional
billions in debt. Monday's PUC proposal treats that debt as a "stranded
cost," which the utility could eventually be expected to absorb, he said.
In a two-hour hearing on Lynch's proposal, PG&E lawyer Chris Warner
called it a "a step in the right direction."
"We agree with President Lynch that it's time to pay the power bills,"
he said. Warner declined to elaborate until the utility could study the
proposal further.
Consumer groups immediately attacked the rate hike proposal.
Jason Zeller, an attorney with the PUC's independent Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, complained that "customers had no notice that they would be socked
with the largest rate increase in California history."
"My big concern . . . is it imposes massive increases, damages the
economy, and there is no guarantee it would do any good," Zeller said.
Bob Finkelstein of the Utility Reform Network said: "The focus [of the
PUC] should be to bring prices down, not rates up."
Power sellers in California's market have "an uncanny ability to sniff
out money," Finkelstein said, and the Lynch proposal "only puts more on the
table."
Lynch blamed the need for rate hikes on exorbitant prices for wholesale
electricity, noting that California paid $7.4 billion for electricity in all
of 1999, and $5.2 billion last January. She also blamed the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission for failing to impose a cap on wholesale electricity
prices in California, despite its mandate under federal law to assure
citizens of "just and reasonable" prices.
To plug the $3-billion hole in the state budget and pay for power in
coming months, lawmakers in February passed a law to sell roughly $10 billion
in revenue bonds. The bonds would be paid back with money collected by the
utilities from their customers.
In recent weeks the utilities have argued that little or nothing is left
over after they subtract their own costs of producing and distributing power
from what they collect from monthly bills.
But on Monday, Lynch issued a draft decision that would force the
utilities to send ratepayer revenue to the state based on a formula set by
the PUC.
Representatives of both PG&E and Edison criticized that proposal at
Monday's hearing, saying it gave priority to the state Department of Water
Resources.
Lynch also proposed forcing the utilities to begin paying hundreds of
small energy producers. Some of those renewable and alternative power
generators have not been paid since November. Many have shut down, and their
lost output contributed to rotating blackouts last week.
The potential rate hikes were seen as lessening the possibility of
utility bankruptcy. That sent investors diving into the stocks of Edison
International, parent of Southern California Edison, and PG&E Corp, parent of
Pacific Gas & Electric Co.
Edison rocketed $3.35, or 30%, to $14.55 while PG&E shares leaped $3.10,
or 29%, to $13.75. Both stocks have lost considerable value in recent weeks
as the electricity crisis dragged on with no solution.
Investors were not discouraged by PG&E's warning that it might take a
$4.1-billion after-tax charge against 2000 earnings if it concludes that it
will not be able to collect its electricity debts through rates. Edison last
week said it might take a $2.7-billion after-tax charge when earnings are
posted, no later than April 15.

Davis Ducks Reality on Electricity 'Overcharges'
By BENJAMIN ZYCHER AND, GARY B. ACKERMAN


As temperatures rise and the lights go out, let us recall the blessed
memory of Marx. Not Karl. Groucho. Well, not Groucho exactly, but instead the
other star of "You Bet Your Life," his duck, which would descend from the
heavens with a cigar and a crisp $100 bill upon hearing a contestant utter
the secret word of the day.
For Gov. Gray Davis, the magic word is "votes," and he wants to offer
$100 bills to everyone, courtesy of the electric power sector. Davis will
discover during the long, hot summer that it won't work. While he and the
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission and the Electricity Oversight
Board have had a grand time chasing each other around a room with whipped
cream pies and seltzer bottles, the economic and political risks faced by
producers have grown, the state budget reserve largely has gone poof! and
efforts both rhetorical and political to force other Western states to bail
California out predictably have come a cropper.
And so the buck-passing season is in full bloom. Accordingly, we now
have studies from the Independent System Operator--the board of which was
appointed by Davis--purporting to show that recent prices charged by power
producers have exceeded costs, and thus have been unreasonable to the tune of
$6.3 billion, concluding that the current mess is all their fault, and that
everyone should get big refunds.
Well. It all depends on what your definition of "cost" is. The ISO
analysis ignores the risks of nonpayment, now very real in the California
market, to the tune of $14 billion owed by the utilities, largely to power
producers and traders. The interest costs on late payment are ignored. The
ISO shunts aside the risks of unplanned outages of generating equipment,
necessitating the purchase of power in volatile spot markets. It ignores the
market value of investment in reliability, the political risks of
after-the-fact changes in the rules of the game, the risks posed by the
lawsuit industry, the risks of transmission breakdowns, the risks of rising
prices for natural gas and on and on. That a number of important costs faced
by power producers do not show up on the books does not mean that they are
not real.
More fundamentally, the mere fact that prices are high does not
demonstrate that the market is noncompetitive. It is not costs that determine
prices in competitive markets, it is the relationship between cost and demand
conditions. Suppose sudden bad weather destroys a substantial part of the
wheat crop. The price of wheat will rise, despite the fact that costs as
measured by the accountants--the price of fuel and other inputs--will not
have increased at all.
The ISO and others attempt to circumvent this simple reality by offering
exotic theories o

Northwest corner of intersection at College and Channing (City of Berkeley
sidewalk adjacent to Unit I Residence Halls complex)

On Thursday morning, April 19, at midnight, three males robbed a U.C.
Berkeley student on the sidewalk at the northwest corner of College and
Channing, in Berkeley. No weapon was seen. After the robbery, the three
suspects fled the scene by running north toward the campus. The victim was
treated at Alta Bates Hospital for injuries to his face and elbow.

The victim was walking from campus to his private residence in the 2700
block of College Avenue. As he approached Channing Way, he saw a group of
three males standing on the curb. As he walked by, Suspect #1 abruptly
punched the victim in the face, knocking him to the ground. The other two
suspects then joined in the assault. The suspects then removed the
victim's wallet from his pants pocket and fled on foot, running north
toward the campus. No suspect vehicle was seen.

Suspects:

#1 - Male, Black, 18-25 years old, 6,18 to 6'2" tall, 150-180 pounds, thin
build, wearing either a white knit cap and dark blue jacket, or a blue knit
cap and a white jacket.

#2 & #3 - Males, Black, 18-25 years old, about 6' tall, thin to medium
builds, both wearing dark clothing.

Randy, Becky and I just had a conference call with John Kroeger, attorney in
FERC's  Market Oversight and Enforcement Office, about the data request we
just received from them regarding gas deals into California for May 2001.  We
explained that the data request we just received was in many regards
identical to the one FERC staff sent us in December and which we answered in
January and we directed him to that response, both for the explanation of how
our business works and why we can therefore cannot answer the questions as
they were framed, and also for an example of what the data will look like for
the new time frame, if we submit it.  (We may have to file written consent
for Kroeger to review this previously filed data, which we agreed to do).
Mr. Kroeger stated they wanted the data request to be construed with common
sense (a refreshing notion).  He agreed that the"contracts" they want would
just be deal tickets for the applicable time frame.  He also indicated a
willingness to extend the time so that we can file information when we get it
in due course.  He will get back to us after he looks at the info already
filed in the SDG&E complaint.

FYI on behalf of Sue Mara:

Governor Gray Davis to address California energy crisis
It is expected he will be speaking for about four minutes and that he will
start at about 6:05 p.m. PDT.




Gov. Davis is expected to deliver a five-minute speech to Californians
Thursday night


From CNN.com:
April 5, 2001
Web posted at: 4:38 p.m. EDT (2038 GMT)
Hena Cuevas is a CNN Correspondent based out of California.
Q: What do we expect to be the main points of Governor Gray Davis' address
this evening?
CUEVAS: His office has said that the basic theme will be conservation.
Basically, he is trying to motivate everyone to conserve. Also, we are
expected to hear a stern warning involving the power situation this summer.
It is expected to be a warmer than average summer. Davis e is also going to
address that. We have also been told that he will make some sort of
announcement and that the announcement is being kept under tight wraps; it is
top secret. At this point we can,t even speculate as to what it will be. But
there will be a big announcement.
It is expected he will be speaking for about four minutes and that he will
start at about 6:05 p.m. PDT.




Q: How has the energy crisis affected the Governor's popularity?
CUEVAS: The latest polls -- and these were probably around Mid-March ) show
that his popularity and his approval ratings have declined. The latest poll
commissioned by the Service Employees International Union shows that only 29
percent of those surveyed said that they would vote for Davis again. He,
however, is trying to distance himself from this energy problem saying that
it is the responsibility of the Republican lead Senate and Legislature who
were the ones that passed these deregulation laws and that basically, he just
got handed the problem and he is trying to solve it.
There was the first ever state Democratic convention in Orange County last
weekend ) Orange County has traditionally been highly Republican. Everybody
there said that they supported Governor Davis and that they believe that the
Democratic Party in this state will not be affected by this crisis, that they
are basically trying to fix what the previous administration did.
Q: What impact will the California energy crisis have on Davis, political
future?
CUEVAS: Davis says that it will not impact his future. He feels very
confident that he has been able to send out the message that he is not
responsible for this crisis and that he is doing everything in his power to
fix it. One of the things that he mentioned in a press conference on Saturday
is that there are already new electrical plants that are under construction
that should be ready by either 2004 or 2005. He says that he is doing
everything in his power to be able to solve this crisis. Again, as things
worsen and as the rolling blackouts begin and continue over the summer,
obviously, everybody is trying to find somebody to blame and he is in the
perfect position. That is why a lot of fingers are being pointed toward him.
Q: What actions has the Governor taken so far to try to avert the energy
crisis?
CUEVAS: One of the things that he has approved is the construction of new
energy plants. Also, he is asking that private companies and other large
power users be allowed to contract directly for power with generators. This
is different than what the Public Utilities Commission had been arguing for.
He has also put forth called the 20/20 plan that says that if you save 20
percent on your consumption of energy as compared to last summer, you will
get 20 percent off your energy bill for the four summer months. He is doing
everything in his power, he says, to try and avoid an even higher rate
increase. However, there are a lot of people who are arguing for a higher
rate and saying that would be the only way to try and stop this crisis.
Q: Do you have any final thoughts to share?
CUEVAS: When you go down to the consumers themselves, everyone is trying to
make sure that the average resident is not the one footing the bill for the
problems that are taking place at the governmental level. There seems to be a
lot of frustration from both residents and businesses. There was a symposium
at UCLA yesterday where the Anderson Business Forecast, a group that usually
does economic forecast for the state of California, said their concern was
that California would be affected in the long run. They said that those that
are thinking about doing business in California might be hesitant and might
look at other states that do not have this uncertainty with the energy
situation and therefore, may not establish operations in California. That was
one of the biggest concerns. Right now California ranks number 48 or 49 in
energy consumption so it is very energy efficient and aware as far as
conservation efforts. So, hopefully, by conserving they might be able to get
past this summer and have a solution by the end of the year.

Effective Friday the 13th of April, I will no longer be employed by Larry
R. Cook & Associates, PC.

I know, I know, the end of an era, you thought you felt the earth slowly
grinding to a halt, etc. etc.  I just had to realize I was just a legend
in my own mind.

I'm moving to the big leagues - I'll be the 35ish employee at MGL Consulting
www.mglconsulting.com - the firm provides comprehensive registration and
compliance services to broker/dealers, investment advisors and insurance
companies.  I'm coming on board to manage the growth of the company through
financial forecasting, modeling and planning as well as being billable
in a role of support for our associate securities attorneys in litigated
matters involving securities - both for and against brokers.

MGL is around the corner from Hewitt Associates in The Woodlands - so
the Suz and I will probably carpool (or walk) to work!

Although it has been a difficult decision to sever my career from Larry,
the opportunity at hand versus the current utility was too great.  We
will remain the best of friends, and as such, will have ready access to
one another as this transition occurs.

For those of you fortunate enough to be clients....I will no longer be
able to serve you in a manner consistent with what you should expect as
I will not be immersed in the day to day operations of the retail financial
world and the information that comes with that.  However, for those of
you not aware, Larry has always reviewed and been aware of all our accounts.
Therefore, you can expect him to continue to monitor and advise you on
your portfolio and planning for years to come.  You do have options: 1)
do nothing and everything continues as is  2) move your account to another
broker  3) change your account to no broker or to another broker of record.
With any of these options we'll be more than happy to accommodate.
Larry is available if you'd like to meet and/or visit with him at any
time.  Larry and I will continue to work together on clients that I'm
involved with for as long as necessary (i.e. if you still want to place
trades through me or contact me to resolve a move or initiate a rollover,
etc., that's more than great!)

Most of my contact information remains the same:

home 281-362-1379
mbl 281-794-6300
internet email danaltom@hotmail.com
presumed new work email daltom@mglconsulting.com
mgl main line 281-367-0380

Dan

PS Since I rarely send out a mass email, I'll take the opportunity to
shamelessly advance the Suz and I's other activities - we've opened an
art gallery in Old Town Spring, come by and visit us - www.creeksidecollection.

FYI--our local counsel's view on Domingo Cavallo (the third Minister of
Economy in a month) as it relates to stamp tax. There are 3 articles on him
in Wednesday's FT.  Sounds like we have friends in high places.  Pete do you
know Carlos Bastos?

By the way, in talking with Gonzalo Flores at the World Bank, it looks like
our claim before the International Center for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) could be registered on Friday.  Recall that ICSID is the
only arbitration forum in the world where a claimant must meet numerous
jurisdictional and standing requirements under the ICSID Convention and the
BIT to be "registered."  It's not a slam dunk especially since TGS has filed
claims in the local court, so if registration is granted Friday, we'll have
cleared the first hurdle. Call me if you have questions. 56159

Gentlemen:

Amit is a former MIT Sloan student whose research was sponsored by a program
set up by Tom Gros to learn more about bandwidth pricing and market effects.
We worked with him quite a bit for a while, as did Vince Kaminski and Stinson
Gibner, on this project.  Well, he has finally graduated and is in the
process of having his thesis published.  He has offered to come down to
present his findings to anyone interested, so I am inquiring as to your level
of interest in order to schedule a meeting, if appropriate.

Below is a short description of his work.  Please let me know your thoughts
and if you have any questions.

Thanks, Jay.

Hi All-

Enron has decided to outsource our accounts payable department and also
implement a whole new system for paying invoices.
What this means to all of us is you may receive email(s) from iBuyit
Payables.  These are very important emails!  These are invoices
that need to be paid.  Any ENA people receiving invoices should automatically
assume they go to me.  As for Sue's group I think
any invoices you receive will need to go to Joseph.  If you are unsure please
let he or I know and we can figure out which one of us should
get the invoice.

Here is the irritating part: You can not just forward the iBuyit Payables
email to me/him.  You must click onto the first link in the email (see
example below).
Then log on to the iBuyit Payables system using your P00# and log-on password
(these are the same P00# and password you use to access
eHRonline).  At this point you will be at your iBuyit Payables in-box.  I
pasted a copy of my in-box below as an example.  There are boxes to check
if you want to forward the invoice.  If you check them all then click on
'Quick Forward' a forward box will appear.  Type in mine, or Joseph's (if
it's his
invoice) last name in the 'last name' box, then click search.  From there you
can click 'Forward'.  I will not only ensure the invoice is paid, but also
give the vendor the correct information for future invoices.

Please bare with me during this time.  This whole process isn't going to be
very much fun for any of us.  However, I have made it my priority to have
this new invoice situation organized as quickly as possible.  If anyone has
any questions please let me know.  On one last note:  All paper invoices
should still be given directly to me then I can send them to A/P for scanning.

Thanks,
April Hrach

The revised response is attached.
I talked with Joe Eisenberg and told him we'd like the Amend. 22 proceeding
included.  He said this primary objective is to have everything proceed in
one forum.  However, he is concerned about giving people an opening to tack
on additional matters.  I said that at a minimum we wanted clarity whether
anything other than the 3 Charge-Back matters were covered by the motion.  He
said there was no problem clarifying if his client wouldn't agree to include
the Amend. 22 matter.
As many of you know the PX sued the ISO regarding funds paid by PG&E to the
ISO that should have gone to the PX.  I asked Joe why the creditors weren't
generally informed this was in the works, and why they filed in district
court if he's trying to "channel" all proceedings.  He said he wasn't really
aware the action was filed (it was filed by another firm).  He had sought
retention of that firm but he thought it was going to be handled throught the
"administrative process".  It seems like there needs to be more focus at the
PX, especially since they're spending the participants money.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Everyone,
I finally touched base with Emily Meyers, my contact at the National
Association of Attorneys General ("NAAG") regarding their involvement on the
telecom side, specifically with regard to Section 271 authorizations.
According to Emily, there is no group effort that exists (i.e., a telecom
committee or an individual AG taking the lead on telecom issues).  Individual
AGs get involved, but that is all.  For example, MA AG Tom Reilley recently
opposed Verizon's application for 271 authority, but the FCC still granted
Verizon's petition.
Emily recommends that we use the AGs as much as possible.  For example, if we
believe that local competition is non-existent and we have evidence to that
effect, we should certainly convey that information to the individual AG and
have him/her weigh in on our behalf.  Emily recognizes that Enron is
pro-competitive and that typically the AGs would be in agreement with our
positions - so it's something for us to keep in mind as we move forward.
There's no guarantee that the FCC will listen to the AGs, but it may be worth
a try.
If anyone has any thoughts or comments, please let me know.  Thanks.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Jeff--nice to see you at the bike ride on Saturday, and  to meet you at the luncheon Monday honoring Jim Derrick. Thought you might be  interested in the report I prepared for people who pledged to MS in connection  with the bike ride over the weekend.

Several persons  who have either pledged, or are considering a pledge, to the National Multiple  Sclerosis Society have left messages or sent emails asking if I am still alive  after the MS150 charity bike ride held this past weekend. Others have asked for  a report of my experience. I am alive and sore. If you are not interested in the  report, please delete this email.

First of all, for  those who have pledged or already sent you checks payable to the National  Multiple Sclerosis Society,  thanks is an inadequate word.  Remember  that you are helping colleagues and others, and perhaps yourself with your  contributions.

This bike ride charity event turned out to be a story  unlike anything I ever expected.

Here is my story, if  you are interested:

BASIC  FACTS:

1.  I did show  up for the bike ride (5:30 am Saturday).

2.  I did start  the bike ride (7:10 am) with approximately 9400 bikers in the largest charity  bike ride in the country.

3.  I did ride  my bike across the finish line in Austin the following day, some 199 miles down  the road..

4.  I did  either ride my bike, or push it up several hills, for approx. 182 miles of the  199 mile route.

5.  I crossed  the finish line in Austin only a few minutes before the deadline of 6:00 pm  on Sunday.

6.  I ended up  meeting in one way or another almost every biker on the trip.  That  resulted from the fact that I started at almost the very front of the pack of  9400 bike riders, and was passed by nearly all of them before I reached  Austin.

7.  I am  extremely pleased to have participated in the event.  I don't have the time  to participate in such events very often, and I was fortunate to have a schedule  which opened up just in time for me to enter this  event.


RANDOM GENERAL  OBSERVATIONS:

1.  The charity  event title, "MS150", is a misnomer.  When I signed up for this event, I  understood the "150" part of the event title to refer to the mileage between  Houston and Austin. I was wrong.  The "150" I now understand to mean the  approximate number of blisters to be found on one's posterior when a biker  crosses the finish line.

2.  I have  driven from Houston to Austin many times in the past.  There are routes  between the two cities that are generally flat with hills of a gentle  grade.  We took a different route.

3.  The ride  from Houston to Austin by car is about 160 miles. The route we took was almost  40 miles further.  The bike ride route displayed on a map appeared  similar to that which you might expect to be drawn by asking an Aggie to find  the shortest distance between two points.

4.  Road kill  if far more attractive from a car than from a bike.

5.  The chicken  ranch in LaGrange is long gone, but the spirit lingers.  The  LaGrange fair gounds was the venue for dinner and lodging at the end of the  first day of biking. We were welcomed there by the local Rotary Club  volunteers with a scrumptuous dinner of barbecued chicken and salad with ranch  dressing.  I laughed out loud when I saw the meal being served, and  wondered whether the historical connection was  intentional.

STRATEGY

I knew when I signed  up for this event that I had almost no chance of completing the ride which, at  the time I entered, I thought was only 150 miles.  I had not trained at all  for the bike ride, and was (and am) not physically fit and dont exercise as I  should.  The total extent of my bike riding during the year prior to  the event was when rode my mountain bike from my home to a  sporting goods store to buy supplies one week before the trip.  Round trip,  my "training" ride to the sporting goods store was about 3  miles.

I sufficiently  realistic to know that I needed a strategy to gain some advantage  to make up for the lack of althletic readiness.  I came up with what I  thought was the perfect solution. Before the race started, I looked for the  largest biker I could spot.  My plan was that if I rode my bike during  the ride immediately behind a very large person, I could draft that person  (Nascar style), and gain a considerable aerodynamic advantage.  I thought  it was a terrific idea and I figured that even if the large person had a slower  pace than I desired, the advantage would be apparent by the end of the  ride.  Luckily, I found just the person I was seeking---this person  appeared to be about 300-325 pounds--a body that would clear a nice swath  of air for me to follow.  When the race started, I maneuvered my bike and  pulled immediately behind the biker who was to be my air blocker.    For the first 5 minutes of the ride, my strategy worked great--I actually could  tell that my air resistance was considerable less when I was directly  behind this large person.  Then, the unexpected happened----my large person  biker turned on her afterburners and left me in the dust.  Never again on  this bike ride was I again able to catch and draft another  biker.

I needed a new  strategy---perhaps a tail wind, which did in fact materialize in spades,   but not before noon the second day of the ride.


THE RIDE IN  DETAIL

I signed up for this  event about two weeks in advance of the ride as a result of my schedule  opening up unexpectedly when it was previously heavily commited.  I  did it largely on  a lark, but the event took on new meaning when I  learned of close friends who have been stricken with MS after I started the fund  raising effort, which is a required part of participating as a  rider.

Iknew I was  out of shape and had been asked by friends if I had gone loco in even attempting  this strenuous activity.  I agreed that I could not keep up the normal pace  of younger and far more physically fit bikers.  So, I made a pledge to  myself.  No matter what, I was not going to overexert myself.  I would  establish a reasonable pace and not even get close to being winded.  I  succeeded in executing this plan until lunch on the first day of the  ride.

I kept a pace that  was clearly nonstrenous and I felt good about the ride for the first 4  hours or so, which was mostly level road.  I was very happy with the ride,  and was looking forward to the tasty box lunch that the announcer has  promised at the start of the day was waiting for every biker when we reached  Bellville, about 50 miles from Houston.  When I got to Bellville, I came to  realize that my pace, although not strenous, was substantially off the  mark.  With a box lunch prepared for over 9000 riders, there were only four  box lunches left when I arrived in Bellville. As I thought back, I  remembered being passed by many bikers.  I  did pass, by my count,  9 bikes before lunch as if they were standing still.  They were.   They all had flat tires.   I decided I needed to pick up the pace  at little after lunch.

I headed out after a  quick lunch to try to make up some time.  By around 2:00 to 3:00, I  was really getting tired and although still cautious about over exertion, I was  losing energy fast. I stopped at a pay phone booth in  a small town, and  called home. I told my 13 year old son William I did not think I would make it  much further.  But I wanted to go as far as I could.  I rode about 10  more miles, and was almost totally out of steam when I remember thinking  "I desparately need a long rest".  About that time, I looked up at  a road sign that said "Cemetery, next exit".  The symbolic connection  was compelling!  I decided it was time to take a rest--a temporary,  not a permanent, one.  I biked past the cemetery where I lay down in  some high grass along the road to catch my breath. The local chiggars and I  bonded almost immediately.  I then flagged down a "SAG" bus, designed  to pick up weary bikers, and got help loading first my bike, then my body, into  a van.  I remember telling the driver that I was "finished" and that I did  not think I could bike anymore for the rest of the way to Austin.  I was  extremely disappointed because I had gone only about 62 miles, and about 80% of  the donations pledged to me were based on distance traveled.  I concluded I  was destined to fall far short of my fundraising goal.

After traveling in  the van for about 15 miles, we came upon the entrance to a ranch of a  friend of mine that I had visited only a couple weeks ago. I asked the van  driver to let me out so that I could see if my friend was home.  I went to  visit the friend, but he was not at his ranch house, and I ended up spending  about an hour taking a nap while waiting for him.  I finally decided to  leave, and found that the rest had given me new strength.  I thought I  might be able to ride again.  To make a long story short, I rode for about  another 4 hours straight until it was total dark.  A van came and picked me  up on the highway and told me it was too dark to continue. I was only 3 miles  short of LaGrange, our stopover spot for the night, and the van carried me on to  this historic spot.

I had really been  looking forward to reaching LaGrange because I was a member of Team Enron, and  Enron's hospitality for its bike riders was by reputation, outstanding.   They had hired 40 messeuses to give massages to the Team Enron bikers, and a  dinner fit for a king would be waiting.  Unfortunately, by the time I  arrived at the LaGrange Fair Grounds, our accomodations for the evening, dinner  in the Enron tent was over and all the masseuses had vanished.  I finally  found a general meal service hosted by the local Rotarians who were serving  barbecued chicken, and a salad with ranch dressing.

Since I didnt enter  the bike event until less than two weeks before it started, Team Enron's private  tent was full and I was relegated to find sleeping space on my own.  I was  directed to a huge feedlot covered with a large tin roof, open air style (no  walls).   As I nestled in my sleeping bag under the big roof with  about 2000 other bikers, my senses told me that I was probably to sleep where a  cow going to market had probably slept only days before.  But I was dog  tired, simply wanted to sleep, and didnt have the energy to find less aeromatic,  alternative, accomodations.


THE SECOND  DAY


I was told that  breakfast would be served at 530 am the next morning, and that the ride would  start at sunup, about 640 am.  I concluded that I could sleep until 6 am,  grab a quick bite, and still be at the starting gate by 640.  Needless to  say, I was happy with my plan to get as much sleep as possible.  I badly  needed the rest. My plan failed.

I did not take into  consideration that I was sleeping among a bunch of gung-ho superbikejocks.   About 4 am, some two hours before I planned to wake up, a large group of  overenenergetic-supercyclists arose and started doing side straddle hops,  stretching, and various exercises while making Monica Seles-like grunting  noises.  I was not amused.  There was no way to go back to sleep! The  five hours of sleep I managed on Saturday night was wholly  inadequate.

I was told that Day  2 of the bike ride was much more difficult than Day 1 because of the more hilly  route as we approached Austin.  To make a long story short,  I  actually gained strength on Day 2 as compared to Day 1. I actually learned some  technique for transferring power from my arms to my legs, and made it to Austin  on my own power without any motorized help of any kind.

The ride through the  hill country was spectacular.  Also, I did get a taste of ole country Texas  along the way. The bike route intentionally  meanders via remote roads through small towns in order to avoid heavy  highway traffic for the safety of the bikers.  As we passed through one  small town that I never heard of before, I looked up to see a sign that  said  "THELMA'S PLACE---POOL, BEER DOMINOS". A sign of equal size  immediately adjacent said "NO GUNS PERMITTED INSIDE".  It was  comforting to know that patrons of that establishment could drink  peacefully while game playing, knowing that customers are  required to  go out to the parking lot to resolve domino disagreements where guns are not  prohibited. I guess I have spent too  much time in the major metropolitan areas of Texas, and have forgotten about the  genuine Texas back country!!


There was one other  noteworthy diversion.  Cycling through Bastrop State Park is known to be  one of the most strenous parts of the trip because of the extreme winding hills  in this beautiful, heavily-wooded area.  The Park is also confusing  because of its multiple intersecting roads through the park. I was  following another biker as we approached the park who was sporting a very fancy  biking shirt on which was written TAM Cycling Club.  I mentioned to him  that I was not looking forward to entering Bastrop State Park because of the  challenging steep hills.  He responded that he knew a route through  the park that was not only less hilly, but was also 3 miles shorter than  the route intended for the bikers.  I was all ears to the prospect of a  short cut, and agreed to follow him on this less strenuous and shorter  route.  We entered the park and,  for the next 10 miles according to  my odometer, it seemed like a roller coaster ride, with turning steep inclines,  and dangerously steep and turning declines.  Exactly one hour and ten  minutes after we entered the park, we finally exited the park--------------at  the exact same place where we entered.  I was exhausted and not  amused.  I should have known that an Aggie inherently is unable to find the  shortest route to Austin.

To fast forward the  story, since this has been far too long already, I made it to Austin on my own  power and did not ask for a lift at all the second day.  I was looking  forward to getting a much needed shower when I arrived at the finishing line  at the UT baseball stadium in Austin.  I had put in my most strenuous  effort during the last hour of the bike ride in the very hilly Austin area where  every hill looks like Mount Everest or its kissing cousin.  Unfortunately  for the person who sat next to me on the bus coming back to Houston, I was  told just after crossing the finish line that the last bus would leave  for Houston in only a few minutes and there was no time to  shower.  At that point in time, I looked like I just stepped out of a sweat  shower.  The stranger next to me on the bus did exactly what I dreaded--he  introduced himself, and waited for a reply.  I really didn't want this guy  to know my name--the name  of the guy who was giving the bus the aroma  of gymnasium locker room---- so after a moments thought, I held out my still  sweaty hand, and proudly said, "Howdy, my name's Harry  Reasoner."

Conclusion:

I participated in  this event because I wanted to help my colleagues and others who are victims of  MS.  If you previously made one of those weirdo pledges that are impossible  for anyone to calculate, please send my secretary a check made payable to  National Multiple Sclerosis Society in whatever amount makes you happy.  If  you have not made a donation, won't you do so today? You will benefit by giving  as much as the people with MS who need your help.  Thank  you.

A newly discovered chapter in the Book of Genesis has provided the answer
to
"Where do pets come from?"

Adam and Eve said, "Lord, when we were in the garden, you walked with us
every day. Now we do not see you anymore. We are lonesome here and it is
difficult for us to remember how much you love us."

And God said, "No problem! I will create a companion for you that will be
with you forever and who will be a reflection of my love for you, so that
you will love me even when you cannot see me. Regardless of how selfish or
childish or unlovable you may be, this new companion will accept you as you
are and will love you as I do, in spite of yourselves."

And God created a new animal to be a companion for Adam and Eve.
And it was a good animal.
And God was pleased.
And the new animal was pleased to be with Adam and Eve and he wagged his
tail.

And Adam said, "Lord, I have already named all the animals in the Kingdom
and I cannot think of a name for this new animal."

And God said, "No problem. Because I have created this new animal to be a
reflection of my love for you, his name will be a reflection of my own
name,
and you will call him DOG."

And Dog lived with Adam and Eve and was a companion to them and Loved
them. And they were comforted.
And God was pleased.
And Dog was content and wagged his tail.

After a while, it came to pass that an angel came to the Lord and said,
"Lord, Adam and Eve have become filled with pride. They strut and preen
like
peacocks and they believe they are worthy of adoration. Dog has indeed
taught them that they are loved, but perhaps too well."

And God said, "No problem! I will create for them a companion who will be
with them forever and who will see them as they are. The companion will
remind them of their limitations, so they will know that they are not
always
worthy of adoration."

And God created CAT to be a companion to Adam and Eve.
And Cat would not obey them.
And when Adam and Eve gazed into Cat's eyes, they were reminded that
they were not the supreme beings.
And Adam and Eve learned humility.
And they were greatly improved.
And God was pleased.
And Dog was happy.
And Cat didn't give a darn one way or the other.

Rod,
David Port is probably best suited to address your first point.
In response to points #2 and #3, we have discussed with Bill Valach and his team their positions in California and continue to incorporate them in our overall corporate exposures reported to management.  We also continue to discuss with him the entire credit situation in the West and any actions ENA may take.  I will call Bill Valach to insure this dialogue continues given the current standing of the divestiture.
I hope this helps.

Meeting w/ Jay Lewis turned out to be with Scott Stoness and Tamara only.
Their mind was pretty well made up that flat surcharge is best approach.  We
prevailed upon them to quantify the impact of several types of rate design,
and the sensitivity of their conclusion to how much of the summer peak load
we can shave.
I also left a message with Gary Weiss telling him Stoness would approach
someone in his organization about how much summer load reduction could
actually be achieved, and asking him to get involved in that process.  (I'm
not sure Scott will convinced, so anything you can do to drum up support of
that idea is great.)  I think this is the real opportunity to minimize losses.

Sue Mara and I are going to talk to Bob Weisenmueller about likelihood of 5
different types of rate design:
1)flat surcharge
2)big summer bang (Loretta's example)
3)on and off peak based on equal % of market price
4)variation on 2-part Real Time Pricing, where load incremental or
decremental to baseline is priced or credited at market price
5)hybrid of embedded cost and market price, reflective of actual portfolio
mix.

I think 2) or 3) are likely and anything else is a longshot.  We'll need to
consider desirability of Enron testimony (also a longshot); but more likely,
identify who we need to partner up with.

Gents, today I received a call from the PREPA operations office asking me for an earlier weekly report due to the fact that this week is a short one for Government employees.    I told him to go ahead and use the same SFP and that I will be back with him if this value will change after consulting with you.  We need to update the inventories and excess fuel available to PREPA and send a report by tomorrow morning.   Are you OK with this SFP?  Dan could you let us know how much excess LNG to nominate with the understanding that the next delivery will be May 3rd?   Remember that the Hilly will bring a full cargo of 122,000 metric tons, which we will not have space in the tank to take it all.  If we want to change the SFP we need to talk today or early morning tomorrow.

Energy Cost Study Critical of Public Agencies Too
Power: DWP is among three government-run producers cited as driving prices
up. Spokesmen deny any market manipulation.

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers

Government-owned utilities, including the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power, were influential in driving wholesale electricity prices to levels
that helped ignite California's exploding energy crisis during the summer and
fall, according to public and confidential records.
For months, Gov. Gray Davis, legislators and consumer advocates have
chiefly blamed a few private power companies for throwing the state into
darkness and economic chaos.
But they are just part of the equation.
A confidential document obtained by The Times names power providers that
have allegedly manipulated the electricity market. While the document does
identify out-of-state merchants criticized for gouging, it also discloses for
the first time the extent to which public entities allegedly have maximized
profits in the volatile spot market.
The document--which decodes the identities of unnamed suppliers in a
recent state study--singles out three government-run agencies as consistently
trying to inflate prices. They are: the DWP, the federally owned Bonneville
Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest and the trading arm of Canada's
BC Hydro in British Columbia.
Like a number of privately owned generators, these three producers
offered power at a range of high prices and, sometimes, in large amounts when
the state was most desperate. They also helped saddle California's three
largest utilities with billions of dollars in debt--leading one, Pacific Gas
& Electric, to seek bankruptcy protection last week.
The study by the California Independent System Operator, or Cal-ISO,
analyzed thousands of hours of bidding practices for 20 large suppliers in
the spot, or "real-time," market from May to November. The study accounted
for factors such as rising production costs, increased demand, periods of
scarcity and profits that would be earned in a healthy, competitive market.
Money earned above that was called excess profits.
No entity--public or private--earned as much in alleged excess profits
as British Columbia's Powerex, the state records show.
"They were the most aggressive bidders," said Anjali Sheffrin, author of
the coded study.
"They had the most amount to bid and the most freedom to bid it in,"
said Sheffrin, who did not discuss any companies by name.
The Canadian agency reaped $176 million in alleged excessive
profits--several times the amount collected by all but one of the private
generators. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Southern Co. Energy
Marketing, now called Mirant, which collected nearly $97 million in alleged
inflated earnings.
BC Hydro and Mirant--along with the DWP and other producers--say they
played by the rules established under California's flawed deregulation plan
and did not exploit the state's troubles.
But BC Hydro officials acknowledge that they did anticipate periods of
severe power shortages and planned for them by letting their reservoirs rise
overnight and then opening them to create hydroelectricity, which could be
produced inexpensively but sold for a premium.
"It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity
would be at any given time," said BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins. "We
helped keep the lights on in California."
And the rates low for their own customers. During the past year, BC
Hydro has stashed hundreds of millions dollars in a "rainy day" account to
ensure that it has among the lowest rates in North America.
Los Angeles' Department of Water and Power, although eighth on the list
of alleged profiteers, was among those singled out for seeking high prices
during periods of high demand that helped inflate costs across the entire
spot market, where emergency purchases are made.
This, according to state documents, was accomplished by offering power
at incrementally higher prices that would rise substantially with even modest
increases in demand. The strategy also helped prop up prices, keeping them
from falling.
The DWP's average hourly bid, or asking price, for electricity
ultimately bought topped such private sellers as Reliant Energy of Houston
and Tulsa-based Williams Cos., two major players in the national energy
market.
In addition, the DWP submitted other bids at far higher prices that
could pay off handsomely with even small bumps in demand, the report said,
referring by code to DWP and four other suppliers. "The data shows they
clearly exercised market power to inflate prices further at higher load
conditions."
DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the report's findings
"outrageous," insisting that the utility never tried to inflate prices.
"These charges go under the heading there is no good deed that goes
unpunished in this state," Freeman said, noting that DWP power helped avert
more blackouts across the state.
He did acknowledge, however, that the agency has charged high prices for
surplus power at the 11th hour but said that was only because it cost more to
produce.
"We have consistently charged [Cal-ISO] our cost, plus 15%," he said.
"It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down
their throats."
Freeman said that when his staff reviewed the coded report, they never
took it personally. "If you're innocent," he said, "you don't look at the
criminal file."
Yet another public agency criticized for its behavior in California's
deregulated market was the U.S. government's Bonneville Power Administration,
a nonprofit agency that sells wholesale electricity produced at 29 federal
dams in the Columbia-Snake River basin.
Bonneville actually bid slightly lower than the DWP, records show, but
reaped millions more in alleged excessive profits, apparently because it
supplied greater amounts of power during the period studied. Bonneville was
in the top five accused of taking excessive profits.
Bonneville officials say some of its profits are used to pay back
federal construction loans and fund an internationally recognized salmon
recovery program.
Stephen Oliver, a Bonneville vice president, said his agency did not act
improperly and has asked Cal-ISO for detailed information on how it reached
its conclusions. He said the grid operator often came to Bonneville pleading
for last-minute electricity and offering to pay high prices.
"From our point of view, we bid what we had when we had it and we
operated precisely within the terms of their rules," Oliver said.
Those rules--and the bidding practices criticized by Cal-ISO--so
distorted the market that Aquila Power Corp. of Missouri, which tried to act
responsibly, has bailed out.
It offered the lowest average hourly price of any supplier
studied--slightly more than $8 per megawatt-hour, compared to Mirant's $138,
the highest.
But the spot market, as initially designed, made sure that all suppliers
offering power received the highest price paid in any hour.
The result: Aquila collected $171 an hour for power it was willing to
sell at a single-digit price.
"They weren't the culprits," said Cal-ISO's Sheffrin. "Someone else
drove that up."
Aquila spokesman Al Butkus said the company pulled out of the California
market because it was too unpredictable. Although the company made money, he
said, it also could have lost because of possible downward swings.
"We looked at it and we didn't feel very comfortable with what we saw,"
he said.
The market has since been adjusted to prevent high bids from setting the
price for everyone. But Sheffrin said it hasn't made much difference because
the overall prices are still excessive.
"We're saying the patient is sick," Sheffrin said of California's
electricity market. "It needs help [and] may die."

The California Independent System Operator says that a total of $505
million in extra profits was reaped by power suppliers from May to November
2000 in California's volatile spot market. The alleged excess profits were
generated by high bids and high-volume sales during periods of peak demand.

HEADLINE: State gets no promise of help

BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens

BODY:

BOISE, Idaho _ A delegation of California legislators traveled here Tuesday
to plead with federal regulators to cap soaring wholesale electricity and
natural gas prices but left within a few hours without any promises of relief.

Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, the delegation leader, urged
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission not to turn its back on the Golden
State. "California is poised on the edge of an economic precipice that
threatens
not only our economy but the economy of the entire country," he said.

But Commission Chairman Curt Hebert chided California for not doing enough
to
solve its own problems. Still, he professed his willingness to help. "It is in
everyone's interest to keep the lights on at all costs," he said.

But Hebert, a protege of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., is a
vocal opponent of price caps and didn't offer the California delegation the
promise it was looking for. That didn't surprise Assemblyman Fred Keely,
D-Santa
Cruz, a member of the delegation. Such a move would be "a dramatic and
unprecedented departure" from past actions of the commission, Keely said as he
left the meeting.

California led the nation in electricity industry restructuring with a 1996
law that turned over control of the state's lifeline of electrons to a market
dominated by a handful of private generating companies.

But so far, the market hasn't delivered on the promise of cheaper power. In
California, power procurement costs jumped to $32 billion in 2000, from $7.4
billion in 1999, and could go as high as $65 billion to $70 billion this year,
Keely said.

Now the state can't put its deregulation genie back in the bottle without
FERC's help. And although two of the three commissioners at Tuesday's meeting
said they were willing to consider price caps, the measure faces an uphill
battle in the five-member commission, which will soon have two new Republican
members appointed by President Bush.

In the meantime, don't look for relief this summer from the region's
hydroelectric dams, the regulators were told. "Probably the greatest energy
crisis the West has experienced ever" looms after a dry winter emptied
reservoirs behind the dams, U.S. Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, told the
commission.

Jim Kempton, a representative of the Northwest Power Planning Council, said
there is a "near-record drought in the Columbia River Basin."

But the region's electricity crunch isn't purely an act of nature, according
to the regulators from 11 Western states who were at the meeting. Complaining
that electricity industry restructuring hasn't created a well-functioning
wholesale market in the Western states, several blamed the control over output
and prices exercised by a handful of generators and traders." "Market power
continues to plague restructuring," said Constance White, a Utah regulator.

But the call for price caps opened a fault line among the regulators and
politicians at the meeting, where opponents of caps had the home-court
advantage. "Price caps do not provide incentives for conservation and do not
provide incentives for investment" in new power plants, said Idaho Gov. Dirk
Kempthorne, a Republican. That position was backed by a letter from nine
Western
governors hailing the commission for its "resistance to the considerable
pressure to impose 'penny wise and pound foolish' rate controls."

The California delegation countered with its own gubernatorial letter, from
Gray Davis, calling for "real and effective price restraints in what is
obviously a dysfunctional electricity market in California and throughout the
West." Davis noted that Oregon and Washington governors support his position.

That call found a receptive ear in William Massey, a FERC member who
supports
caps. "Our passion for markets must be tempered with common sense," he said.

Some at the meeting took the opportunity to offer California some advice on
how to deal with its problems. Marsha Smith, an Idaho regulator, urged
Californians to prepare to bite the bullet. "The only answer for the summer is
demand reduction," she said. "If the price goes (beyond the limit you're
willing
to pay), don't buy it. I would rather have rolling blackouts."

HEADLINE: Price gouging could force new energy rate boost, PUC chief says

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

The state's top electricity regulator told a congressional hearing yesterday
that California may have to raise rates again if federal regulators do not
stop
price gouging by generators.

The president of the Public Utilities Commission, Loretta Lynch, told the
congressional panel that ''California is literally being plundered, with the
full knowledge and consent of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.''

When the PUC adopted the biggest rate increase in California history last
month for Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison, Lynch said
she believed that no more rate increases would be needed.

But Lynch had a different view yesterday as she testified at a hearing on
the
California electricity crisis chaired by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., which
continues today in San Jose and tomorrow in San Diego.

Lynch told Burton that the two rate increases adopted by the PUC since
January totaled 4 cents per kilowatt hour, enough to be a 60 percent increase
if
they were enacted in Burton's congressional district in Indiana.

''It may not be enough,'' Lynch said, ''if the current price-gouging
practices persist and remain unabated by federal regulators.''

The PUC raised the PG&E and Edison residential rate 9 percent in January. A
second increase last month raised the electricity tab more than 40 percent and
the total monthly bill, including transmission and distribution fees, 26
percent.

The PUC has not acted on a request by San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in
a
different financial situation, for a rate increase of 2.3 cents per kilowatt
hour.

Lynch said a flawed deregulation plan pushed by former Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson ''caused the utilities to sell off much of their generation to entities
who now hold us hostage daily to extortionate price demands for electricity.''

The Republican congressmen on the panel reopened the debate about whether
Lynch, an appointee of Democratic Gov. Gray Davis, and the PUC prevented
utilities from obtaining cheap long-term power contracts last fall.

Lynch said the PUC quickly approved long-term contracts last Aug. 3, two
weeks after a request from the utilities. She said the utilities obtained a
number of long-term contracts but declined to give details, referring the
panel
to the utilities.

The San Diego-based consumer group Utility Consumers' Action Network is
suggesting dramatically different solutions to the state's power crisis.

UCAN will release a report today calling for a ''buyers' cartel'' made up of
the states of California, Oregon and Washington that would buy power together,
insisting on reasonable prices from power generators.

UCAN also calls for the forced sale to the state of any in-state power
generator that refuses to sell at reasonable rates.

HEADLINE: POWER CRISIS: FOG STARTS TO THIN;

MOVEMENT TOWARD SOLUTIONS IS NOW VISIBLE IN THE ELECTRICITY CRISIS, A BIG
ADVANCE FROM THE RECENT IMPASSE.

BODY:


California's effort to resolve its energy crisis now is headed down two
radically different tracks, one through the U.S. Bankruptcy Court and the
other
via the state regulatory and political process. Since each route leads into
unknown territory, no one knows how this is going to come out, but the
divergence itself has potential benefits. State political leaders and other
Californians will be able to weigh each approach as Pacific Gas & Electric's
case progresses through federal court and Southern California Edison's winds
through the Legislature and the state Public Utilities Commission.

In the wake of PG&E's bankruptcy filing Friday, Gov. Gray Davis announced
that accelerated negotiations with Southern California Edison had produced an
agreement to help the firm out of debt with a state purchase of Edison's
electricity transmission grid for $ 2.76 billion.

There are also potential benefits in Edison's decision to deal with the
state
rather than go into bankruptcy. Some are spelled out in a 36-page memorandum
of
understanding reached with Davis. A major provision is that Edison must sell
all
of its power generation to the state for the next 10 years at cost, a figure
to
be determined by the PUC. This amounts to about 40% of the power that Edison
supplies to its service area, which covers Southern California except for the
San Diego region and the cities of Los Angeles, Pasadena, Glendale and
Anaheim.

One troubling question is whether it still makes sense for the state to buy
Edison's share of the state power transmission grid in the absence of a
similar
deal with PG&E. Davis insists that even with a portion of the grid, the state
will be able to expand it and make it more reliable, and therefore he is
continuing negotiations with San Diego Gas & Electric for its portion. This is
an issue the Legislature needs to explore, along with whether any additional
rate hikes are necessary--Davis says they are not--and how much Edison's
parent
firm should be required to contribute to the deal. What Davis agreed to may be
good for Edison, but is it too good?

The Edison agreement won support from the investment firm Goldman Sachs,
which suggested it serve as a pattern for a quick restructuring of
PG&E--something the Bankruptcy Court would probably have the power to do. PG&E
has summarily rejected additional talks with the state, but Bankruptcy Judge
Dennis Montali should examine the Edison deal carefully for elements that
might
be of value in the PG&E case.

The damage done over many months--to the utilities' financial health, to the
state's coffers and credibility, to consumer confidence--cannot be repaired
overnight. It will take months for electricity rate hikes to start denting the
utilities' debts, for the state's financial drain to be added up and for the
prospects of repayment to be clear. It is also possible that the crisis has
not
hit bottom yet, and that a vicious brew of summer heat, unregulated price
spikes
and electricity shortages will deal the state a knockout blow. Even so,
forward
motion toward solutions is now visible. It is an improvement over the opaque
muddle that existed even a week ago.

HEADLINE: LEADERSHIP IN POWER CRISIS

BODY:


* Michael J. Aguirre's "Use Eminent Domain as a Power Tool" (Commentary,
April 9), on the lack of leadership shown in the current power crisis by Gov.
Gray Davis and the Legislature, reflects the feelings of the silent majority
in
California. We need to have our government literally take back the power
supplies for Californians.

Why do we call these modern robber barons (PG&E and Edison) public
utilities,
when in reality they are private money-grabbing companies? The concept of a
public utility and the associated tax breaks that go with it was designed to
protect the public good.

We need a governor and Legislature like Teddy Roosevelt, who become irate,
stand up and slug it out with the robber utilities. It is time for the
government to use the power of eminent domain. If our politicians lack the
guts,
we need to exercise our right of political recalls to protect the public
interest and guarantee the new political slogan "power for the people."

I wonder where these "intermediary" companies that are charging PG&E,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric such outrageous prices
are in the governor's negotiations. Someone obviously has made a tidy profit
from the deregulation in 1996. Who is protecting them? Surely we all have our
hindsight opinions and see the pitfalls of the decisions that were made in the
past decade. Population growth, no new power plants, deregulation . . . hmm.

I am confident that there are enough politicians and clever business school
geniuses who can get us back on track. But let's look at the whole picture and
involve all parties in planning. Before our state government is in the throes
of
"electrical bankruptcy," I would invite the 1996 legislators and the
intermediary power brokers (yes, that pun is intentional). There's enough room
at the governor's table.

power providers that caused PG&E, Edison and SDG&E to be on the verge of
bankruptcy.

If Gov. Davis wants to create a significant reduction in California's energy
consumption, he should implement a 35-hour workweek for all state government
employees and urge all California employers to do the same. If every office
building in the state powered up at 8 a.m. or 8:30 a.m. instead of 7:30 a.m.,
the savings would be tremendous. American workers put in the longest working
hours in the industrialized world.

HEADLINE: California Lawmakers Demand More Energy Efficiency from Businesses

BYLINE: By Sylvia Moore

BODY:


California is the nation's most energy-efficient state, but state lawmakers
want businesses to conserve even more.

Saving electricity is the point of an executive order issued by Gov. Gray
Davis in February that requires California businesses to substantially reduce
outdoor lighting during non-business hours.

To make sure that all businesses in Monterey County get the message,
representatives from the California Technology, Trade and Commerce Agency
(TTCA)
joined with local law enforcement and the Kmart Corp. on Tuesday at a news
conference inside the Seaside Kmart.

The governor's order went into effect Mar. 15, as a reaction to the state's
current energy crisis and will continue to be law for the foreseeable future.

The conference was part of an outreach effort that will include handing out
informational pamphlets to businessowners.

"This is a voluntary outreach educational effort," said TTCA Secretary Lon
Hatayama. "We would like for businesses to conserve on their own." Hatayama
praised Kmart Corp. as one of the businesses leading the way to energy
conservation -- thanks to a $ 2 million grant from the state.

The state is asking businesses to reduce energy consumption from outdoor
lighting by 50 percent or more, but not so much that it endangers the safety
of
the public, employees and property. Businesses are also required to shut off
lighting primarily used for decorative or marketing functions when closed. As
a
last resort, businesses that fail to work with law enforcement and voluntarily
comply with the law may face a $ 1,000 fine.

"We don't expect (police) officers to be counting light bulbs," said
Hatayama. "We do not want to jeopardize safety -- only ensure that the
reduction
is reasonable."

Hatayama said the goal is for California businesses to reduce overall energy
consumption by 3,700 megawatts during peak periods, and by 10 percent over the
summer.

Both Seaside Community Liaison Officer Barry Pasquarosa and Monterey County
Sheriff Lt. Mike Derbyshire said local businesses have reacted positively to
the
call to conserve.

"The voluntary compliance has been remarkable," said Derbyshire.

Hatayama added that the tremendous reduction his agency has seen among
Monterey County businesses, including those once brightly-lit auto malls, has
not reduced sales.

Kmart Corp.'s divisional energy manager, Adel Suleiman, thanked Davis and
the
California Energy Commission for granting the company $ 2 million to reduce
energy emissions in 85 of its California stores. As a result, Suleiman said,
Kmart is currently retrofitting existing outdoor light fixtures at these
stores
with energy-efficient bulbs. So far, the company has been able to reduce
indoor
lighting at its stores by 40 percent and outdoor lighting by more than 50
percent.

"We are committed to (saving) 8.2 megawatts by summer and 12 megawatts by
the
end of the year," Suleiman said, adding that the savings are equal to the
energy
needed to power 10,000 homes.

Suleiman also pointed out the number of energy efficient products Kmart
offers to customers, including compact florescent bulbs, weatherstripping and
ceiling fans. The items cost a bit more, he said, but they are well worth the
savings consumers will eventually see in their electric bills.

"These innovative programs by the state and the Department of Energy
Conservation have made Kmart proud to be in California," said Suleiman. "We
realize the challenge that California faces, and Kmart is doing its part to
conserve."

Different Ways Of Coping for PG&E, Edison;

It may take years to determine if bailout or bankruptcy was wisest

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
This much at least is sure: Either Pacific Gas and Electric Co. or Southern
California Edison is very, very clever.

PG&E, which filed for bankruptcy protection last Friday, believes the best
way for it to return to financial health is by throwing itself on the mercy of
the court

and plodding through months or

years of contentious litigation.

Edison, meanwhile, agreed Monday to a sweeping bailout accord with Gov.
Gray
Davis that, if given final approval, would instantly restore the utility to
creditworthiness but force it to sell off valuable assets and commit to
bargain-basement power contracts.

"One has a deal and the other doesn't, so today it looks like Edison made
the right choice," said Michael Worms, an energy-industry analyst at Gerard
Klauer Mattison in New York.

"But we won't really know for sure until PG&E's bankruptcy thing plays
out,"
he said. "It could be that they did this correctly."

If nothing else, both PG&E and Edison are convinced that they have chosen
wisely.

"A negotiated, practical, comprehensive resolution is far preferable to
bankruptcy," said John Bryson, chairman of Edison International, parent of the
Southern California utility.

That's fine for Edison, "given its set of facts," PG&E said in a brief
statement. "Given our set of facts, we continue to believe that a Chapter 11
reorganization is the most feasible means to reach a solution."

Analysts said two factors played pivotal roles in each company's decision:
money and culture.

While both utilities hope to recover past costs for wholesale power, PG&E
says it is owed $9 billion, while Edison's debt is only about half that.

"PG&E concluded that because they're owed so much more money than Edison,
they had a better chance in Bankruptcy Court," said Brian Youngberg, an
analyst
at brokerage Edward Jones in St. Louis.

Culturally, analysts said, PG&E prides itself on nearly 100 years of
providing electricity and gas to Northern Californians. Therefore, selling off
its transmission lines would have been a blow to the company's core identity.

Edison, for its part, is seen as a less enthusiastic player in the utility
business, and its parent company had few qualms about shedding assets.

Aside from its utility, Edison International owns power plants and, through
its Edison Capital subsidiary, is involved in various investment projects.

As California's two largest utilities pursue opposite paths to
profitability, consumers have been left scratching their heads over how this
will affect both the state's energy crisis and future electricity bills.

A summer of power shortages remains virtually a sure thing. Higher
electricity rates are almost certain as well.

"At the end of the day, California consumers have gotten a raw deal," said
Dan Jacobson, a spokesman for the California Public Interest Research Group in
Sacramento.

Edison customers already know a rate hike is in the works; they will pay a
special charge on their bills to help cover the state's bailout agreement.

PG&E customers must wait to see whether the bankruptcy judge will seek to
pass along the utility's multibillion-dollar debt to ratepayers -- a decision
that could take years to reach.

Yet whether through bankruptcy or bailout, Jacobson said PG&E and Edison
face no choice but to raise rates as the state continues to pay sky-high
wholesale prices for electricity.

Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg estimated yesterday that California will
spend about $65 billion this year buying power, compared with just $5 billion
last year.

To cover this huge increase, "the whole state is going to see higher
rates,"
Jacobson warned.

Which leads to the question of the hour: As power costs soar, is the
governor buying a pig in a poke with his quest to purchase the transmission
lines of all three California utilities?

Public ownership of the power grid would do little if anything to reduce
electricity costs. If anything, it would place taxpayers or ratepayers -- or
both -- on the hook for billions of dollars in repairs and upgrades to the
system.

Yet Davis is depicting public ownership of the power lines as a necessary
step toward solving California's myriad energy problems.

While the Edison deal awaits final approval from state regulators and the
Legislature, Davis already has entered into talks with Sempra Energy on
acquiring the power lines of its San Diego utility.

"We've stabilized one of the utilities and are negotiating with another
one," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor. "This puts us in a
strong position to buy the rest."

In Edison's case, the lines will be leased back to the utility for a
nominal
fee.

Maviglio said the state will file a petition with Bankruptcy Judge Dennis
Montali informing him of California's interest in purchasing PG&E's
transmission
network, should Montali begin selling the utility's assets to pay off
creditors.

"Since it's one of their largest assets, we think it's a likely candidate,"
Maviglio said.

But even if Davis succeeds in acquiring the thousands of miles of power
lines of all three utilities, what then?

"There is a notion that the state will control a government-owned power
grid
and somehow we will all be better off," said Harry Snyder, senior advocate at
Consumers Union in San Francisco.

However, he said the power lines may end up being little more than "a hard
asset that makes it look like we weren't just giving cash away for nothing."

Actually, there may be some upside to ownership of the transmission lines.
For one thing, this could give California more clout in its dealings with
power
generators.

The state theoretically could argue that if generators want their juice
shipped to ratepayers' homes, they must charge more reasonable prices.

On the other hand, generators could just as easily say that if California
wants electricity for its newly purchased lines, and thus raise money in
transmission fees, it should mind how it deals with its new business partners.

Meanwhile, as the owner of power lines, California would have an easier
time
getting its voice heard by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, with
oversees transmission systems nationwide.

To date, California's entreaties to FERC for regional caps on wholesale
power prices have fallen on deaf ears. Owning power lines would not
necessarily
make FERC more attentive to the state's interests, but it would raise
California's profile. E-mail David Lazarus at dlazarus@sfchronicle.com.

HEADLINE: State Legislators Take Argument For Electricity Rate Cap to Feds

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

BODY:
Taking off before dawn, a delegation of California lawmakers yesterday winged
its way to a stark airport hotel here and pleaded for federal regulators to
intervene in the state's dysfunctional energy market.

The lawmakers had arranged just the day before to attend a meeting of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, signaling just how desperate they are to
gain an upper hand in California's energy crisis.

FERC, as the body is known, has become a four-letter word among many
California politicians. The panel's steadfast refusal to embrace wholesale
price
controls on electricity has left everyone from the governor to the state's
congressional delegation fuming -- although one commissioner appeared
yesterday
to soften her opposition to the idea.

After just four hours of sleep before the last-minute trip, Assembly
Speaker
Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, was in no mood to be confrontational.

He figured that since FERC-bashing had gained little, the state might be
better off showing what it had done to try to solve its own problem.

"We didn't want to go and be Khrushchev banging his shoe on the table," he
said. "We are telling FERC we're in this together. We have a role, and you
have
a role."

So Hertzberg opened his five-minute remarks by acknowledging that
California
had created some of its own problems. But he pleaded with the three
commissioners to pay attention to what was happening in the Golden State.

'ECONOMIC PRECIPICE'

"California is poised on the edge of an economic precipice that threatens
not only our economy, but the economy of the entire country," Hertzberg said,
adding that the state anticipated paying $65 billion for electricity this
year,
almost 10 times its power bill in 1999.

Two of the three board members seemed to hear the request. Commissioner
William Massey has long been an advocate for increased FERC intervention. And
Linda Breathitt, the third sitting commissioner, appeared to further soften
her
reluctance to impose price controls yesterday.

"I have increasing concerns about what the summer holds," she said. "We
must
find a way to calm the troubled market if a competitive market is ever going
to
become a reality."

But FERC Chairman Curt Hebert is the man standing squarely in the way of
California's requests. As the head of the board, he has complete control over
its agenda.

California and other states believe price controls are essential for
getting
through the summer, while Montana, Arizona and other states believe caps would
suppress supply and make the situation worse.

Hebert believes in free markets, and as an appointee of President Bush,
concurs with Bush's belief that price caps would do nothing to help and would
perhaps make the situation even worse.

THE NAYS HAVE IT

"We've continued to have an open mind," Herbert said in a deep Texan drawl,
even as he shook his head. "If you look at the landscape here, there are a
number of commissioners and states that seem to be averse to any type of price
cap -- it seems to outweigh those that want a price cap."

At times, he accused California of dragging its feet and not doing enough
to
deserve special attention from FERC. But the two other commissioners were
quick
to defend the state.

California's Assembly members went to the six-hour meeting with a proposal:
"cost-base" price caps for 18 months on natural gas and electricity prices.
The
idea would be for the price to be capped at cost to generate the power, plus a
reasonable rate of return.

Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on the energy
crisis,
said, "We're pleading with FERC.

"I don't think we're splitting hairs," Keeley said. "The cost-base price
cap
allows generators to make a profit while bringing stability to the market."

But most representatives from other states passionately disagreed.

"A FERC policy could have glorious intentions and disastrous consequences,"
said Nevada Public Utilities Commissioner Richard McIntire. "FERC must resist
pressure to institute price caps."

But Keeley said if the federal government did not take action, the state
would have to do what it could to control the wholesale prices.

While there has been talk in Sacramento of taking over power plants, Keeley
said the more logical step would be to take over power contracts. The state
could step in and take over the power before it is sold to the marketer, thus
preventing huge artificial mark-ups, Keeley said.

Assemblyman Anthony Pescetti, R-Rancho Cordova, said, however, "I have
concerns about seizing anything."

Meanwhile in Sacramento, three GOP members of Congress grilled
representatives of FERC, the Public Utilities Commission and the Independent
System Operator about their roles in the state's energy mess.

Yesterday's politically tinged hearing was the first of three meetings the
House Government Reform Committee will hold around the state this week. Hebert
will appear at a hearing in San Jose today.

Much of the committee's questioning fell on PUC President Loretta Lynch,
who
was appointed to the post by Gov. Gray Davis.

The GOP lawmakers accused Lynch of worsening the crisis by dragging her
feet
on giving utilities the power to enter long-term contracts and thus avert more
costly spot-market buying.

She replied that the PUC had granted the utilities' request to enter into
long-term contracts within two weeks.

Lynch blamed FERC's lifting wholesale price caps for the astronomic rise in
electricity prices.

HEADLINE: Gas Plant's Proposal Alarms Neighbors in Calvert; Owner Pushes to
Reactivate Facility

BYLINE: Raymond McCaffrey, Washington Post Staff Writer

BODY:


The predicament they're facing has become ordinary in the outer reaches of
the Washington area: a major construction project planned for the
neighborhood.

Their concerns are anything but.

Terrorist attacks. Nuclear meltdowns. Environmental disaster.

That's what residents in southern Calvert County fear could happen if a
Tulsa-based company is allowed to go ahead with a $ 120 million project to
reactivate and refurbish a liquefied natural gas storage and importation
facility at Cove Point.

At a recent public meeting hosted by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, which will decide the fate of the Williams Co. proposal, neighbors
worried aloud about the potential for a disaster -- accidental or intentional
--
either at the facility or involving one of the large tankers that would
deliver
imported fuel via the Chesapeake Bay.

But their biggest fear is the effect that such a disaster would have on
another facility that stands just a few miles away -- the Calvert Cliffs
Nuclear
Power Plant.

"What happens if the plant goes sky-high and a lot of us go with it?"
resident Mary Robinson asked federal officials at the meeting.

In a letter to federal regulators, resident Norman Overfield urged them to
consider the ramifications of a terrorist act. "It would seem that it would
only
require a source of ignition to transform an accidental discharge into a large
firestorm," Overfield wrote. "Consider the possible consequences of a
deliberate
attack on a ship at the terminal similar to the attack on the USS Cole in
Aden,"
he continued, referring to the suicide bombing of a U.S. destroyer in Yemen in
1999.

The concerns of the residents are similar to those expressed by residents
in
Montgomery and Frederick counties who live near sites where companies have
proposed new or expanded facilities to meet the nation's growing energy needs
--
which have been highlighted by the California electricity crisis.

Demand for energy is behind the proposal by Williams, which asked the
federal commission to approve its plan by September so it can begin importing
liquefied natural gas in April 2002 to an offshore pier near the Cove Point
installation plant. The gas would then be piped in vapor form for 87 miles,
from
Calvert through Prince George's, Charles, Fairfax and Loudoun counties.
Utilities would buy the gas and resell it to businesses and individuals.
Utilities could also use the gas to generate electricity.

"It gives you a new source of supply to meet the growing demand for gas and
also for electricity," said Joe Fields, a Williams official who is involved
with
the Cove Point project.

The Cove Point plant was built in 1974, and its former owners, the Columbia
and Consolidated Natural Gas companies, operated a liquefied natural gas
terminal and related pipeline facilities. In 1979, a gas explosion at the
plant
killed one employee and injured another.

The importation operation ended in December 1980 because of falling
domestic
natural gas prices and a dispute with exporters from Algeria, the main source
of
the product, according to Williams officials. The onshore facilities reopened
in
1994 to provide a natural gas storage service.

Williams bought the plant in June and wants permission to reactivate the
offshore facility and build a fifth storage tank with a capacity of 2.5
billion
cubic feet. The four existing storage tanks are twice as large.

The pier, which is about 1 1/4 miles offshore and connected to the plant by
an underwater tunnel, will be refurbished to handle tankers that typically are
about 1,000 feet long and 150 feet wide, according to a county official.

Vouching for the plant's safety, Fields maintained that many of the
residents' fears were "concerns you heard when the facility opened" in the
1970s.

"Safety is Williams' and Cove Point's primary concern," he said.

The Energy Regulatory Commission and the Department of Transportation "have
safety guidelines," Fields said. "We build to either meet or exceed those
guidelines."

The company has received the endorsement of the Calvert County Board of
Commissioners, which is eyeing the up to $ 2 million in annual tax revenue
that
the refurbished plant would generate. Commissioners are desperately looking
for
money to build schools and pay for other services in Calvert, where the
population has jumped 45 percent over the last decade. Critics say that's the
very reason federal regulators need to give the plan a hard look.

Those voicing concerns are not just neighbors of the plant. The list of
official interveners in the federal review includes the Maryland Department of
Natural Resources, which wants time to assess the plan. While the department
does not oppose the project, it is against a request by Williams that the
federal commission expedite the review, said Richard McLean, a department
manager of nuclear programs.

McLean has maintained that an expedited review would not allow enough time
to assess concerns such as the effect of the tankers on the Chesapeake Bay or
potential risks the renewed operation might pose to nearby Calvert Cliffs,
which
won relicensing from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission last year.

A three-decade-old environmental assessment is not valid today, McLean
said,
referring to the last time such issues were fully examined for the gas plant.

Not only has Calvert's population nearly doubled since then, but operations
have expanded at the Patuxent River Naval Air Station in nearby St. Mary's
County, he said. Commercial and recreational boat traffic on the Chesapeake
Bay
have increased, too, McLean said.

"There's no question in my mind that we want to revisit our prior risk
assessment," he added. "The risk assessment is risk for the communities, risk
for the Patuxent River Naval Air Station, which has a whole lot more people
than
before . . . and there is some concern that this could potentially compromise
commercial freight traffic on the bay."

Federal regulators have said that the commission has not decided whether to
expedite the review. Regardless, they said, an extensive risk-assessment study
would be conducted and available for public review.

Yet some expressed concern that the growing need for fuel will force the
government to speed up the review.

"You can't compromise a process because somebody says we need this," McLean
said.

HEADLINE: Report: Government utilities allegedly gouged California during
power
crisis

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

BODY:

Private power wholesalers have been blamed for driving up California's
electricity prices but even government-owned utilities allegedly manipulated
the
market, maximizing profits and inflaming the energy crisis, according to a
confidential document obtained by the Los Angeles Times.

The document shows that the power providers, including the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, influenced the spiraling costs of wholesale
electricity between May and November 2000.

The DWP was eighth on the list of alleged price gougers for seeking high
prices during periods of high demand, which helped inflate costs across the
entire spot market, the document said.

The document decodes the identities of unnamed power providers in a recent
study by the California Independent System Operator. CISO examined thousands
of
hours of bidding practices for 20 large electricity providers.

DWP General Manager S. David Freeman called the findings "outrageous."

"We have consistently charged (CISO) our cost plus 15 percent," Freeman
said.
"It's not as though we're up there peddling a bunch of power to jam it down
their throats."

In addition to the DWP, the document singles out two other government-run
agencies that it said consistently inflated prices: the federally owned
Bonneville Power Administration in the Pacific Northwest, and the trading arm
of
Canada's BC Hydro in British Columbia.

BC Hydro reaped the most in what the state's power-grid operator deemed
"excess profits." The Canadian agency took in $176 million, several times the
amount of allegedly excessive earnings collected by all but one private
generator. Second on the list was Atlanta-based Mirant which collected nearly
$
97 million.

The companies cited said they broke no state rules and abided by
California's
1996 deregulation law, the Times reported Wednesday.

BC Hydro officials acknowledged, however, that they anticipated periods of
severe power shortages and let their reservoirs fill with water overnight,
then
opened them to produce cheap hydroelectric power to sell at a premium.

"It was the marketplace that determined what the price of electricity would
be at any given time," BC Hydro spokesman Wayne Cousins told the Times. "We
helped keep the lights on in California."

HEADLINE: States say federal government needs to act to stem energy crisis

BYLINE: By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: BOISE, Idaho

BODY:

A six-hour brainstorming session between federal and state energy regulators
ended with a clear message: Western states want more help from Washington to
corral the region's deepening power crisis.

The three members of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission flew to Idaho
for what Chairman Curtis Hebert called "frank discussions" with officials from
11 Western states about the astronomical electricity prices that have spread
from California to almost every corner of the region.

And the Washington regulators got an earful.

"Montana is taking a hell of a hit because of this market," declared Gary
Feland, whose job it is to approve requests by the state's utilities to pass
wholesale price increases on to their retail customers.

"Politically we're getting beat up," added Feland.

In many states, retail electricity sales are still regulated, but wholesale
markets are not. The state officials warned that many of the electricity rate
increases, stemming from wholesale price run-ups, have yet to reach consumers,
but will in the coming months as states have no choice but to approve them.

Much of the discussion focused on whether FERC, which regulates the
wholesale
power market, should temporarily impose price controls to ease the impact of
what one of the commissioners, William Massey, called "a looming disaster"
this
summer if nothing more is done.

Afterward, Hebert tallied up the results: Five states opposed such controls,
three wanted them desperately and three others were not sure. Previously, the
latter three had lined up in the "no" column.

Hebert has made clear his opposition to renewed price regulation - even
temporarily to address an emergency - because he argues that a free market is
the only way to get people to build more power plants and transmission lines
and
create the "price signal" to foster conservation.

His position drew support from Vice President Dick Cheney in a telephone
interview with the Associated Press in Olympia, Wash.

"The problem with price caps is that they don't solve the problem," said
Cheney. "Just look at California, where they had caps applied at the retail
level that, coupled with the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has
driven PG&E into bankruptcy."

Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, said last week it had
debts of $9 billion and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.

Like the state officials, FERC is deeply split on the issue of price
controls.

"It is wrong to put the entire Western economy in harm's way solely to
protect a price signal arising from a dysfunctional market," Massey said. "Our
passion for the market must be tempered with commonsense."

A contingent from California submitted a proposal calling for cost-based
price caps for 18 months on wholesale electricity and natural gas sales across
the West. Only FERC can impose such caps.

"We have done our part. We cannot do it alone," Bob Herzberg, speaker of
California's Assembly, told the three FERC commissioners. The Californians
listed the state's response to its power problems so far: Actions to boost
conservation, increase retails electricity rates and speed up power plant
construction. Still, they bemoaned that California this year was expected to
spend $65 billion on electricity, nearly 10 times its power bill in 1999.

Hebert insisted that the FERC "is doing everything it can" to ensure just
and
reasonable prices and cited the commission's action to seek $124 million in
refunds on California power sales. He also said the commission plans soon to
approve a new system of tracking market abuses.

Officials from Washington state and Oregon joined California in the plea for
temporary price regulation. The Northwest has been hit by a severe drought,
making less hydro-generated electricity available and forcing greater reliance
on the high-priced spot market. On Monday the Bonneville Power Authority said
it
may have to nearly triple what it charges for its power if demand doesn't drop
sharply and reduce the need of spot market purchases.

But in a surprising development, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico said they no
longer were sure that price controls would be such a bad thing. And even those
opposed to price caps, like Montana's Feland, criticized FERC for not being
more
aggressive in challenging prices - many of them now 10 times what they were a
year ago - as unreasonable.

"In the real world, in the world of the West, the ideal market doesn't
exist," Marilyn Showalter, a Washington state utility regulator said. She
disputed the contention that price caps would discourage investment, arguing
that the uncertainties brought to soaring prices already were doing that.

"The lack of action (from FERC) is threatening to undermine the commission's
own credibility" and eroding political confidence in electricity deregulation
and competition, she said.

HEADLINE: Cheney urges patience for Bush's energy approach

BYLINE: By DAVID AMMONS, AP Political Writer

DATELINE: OLYMPIA, Wash.

BODY:

Vice President Dick Cheney is urging fellow westerners to give the Bush
administration more time before judging its record on energy and the
environment.

Cheney, in a telephone interview with The Associated Press from the White
House, said the administration is barely under way, but over time it will
become
clear that President Bush has a balanced and smart view on the environment and
will help the nation weather the short-term energy crunch.

Cheney was responding to criticism from western Democrats, including
Washington Gov. Gary Locke and Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., who gave the two most
recent Democratic responses to Bush's weekly radio addresses.

Locke accused Bush of pushing policies that will harm the environment,
specifically mentioning the recent decision to roll back regulations limiting
the amount of arsenic in drinking water. Inslee said the administration offers
only "excuses and inaction" on the West's deepening energy woes.

Cheney, who heads Bush's energy task force, defended the
administration's strong opposition to energy price caps, which all three West
Coast Democratic governors have advocated.

"The problem with price caps is that they don't solve the problem - just
look
at California where they had caps applied at the retail level that, coupled
with
the requirement to buy power on the spot market, has driven PG&E (Pacific Gas
&
Electric) into bankruptcy," he said Tuesday.

California's energy deregulation has price caps for customers, but not
wholesalers.

"To say the solution is price caps shows that they haven't spent much time
studying the problem," Cheney said. "Caps provide some short-term political
relief to the politicians, but (are) no long-term answer."

Conservation, permit streamlining and more power production are what the
West
needs, he said.

Much of the region faces a drought, with snowpack only half the normal
level,
he noted.

"We will have to find ways to do everything we can to conserve, to only use
the power we absolutely have to have," he said.

Beyond that, "The main thing is to try to build our long-term generating
capacity if we can get beyond the next year or two."

Locke stood by his earlier criticism of the White House.

"We hear a great deal of talk about drilling and digging and burning, but
not
a great deal of talk about renewable sources of energy," said Dana Middleton,
the governor's communications director.

Temporary price caps are essential, she said.

"People need relief right this minute," she said. "Temporary limits can
stabilize the market and allow all the western states to put their plans into
effect, to let everyone get their houses in order, especially California.

"We're just asking for a little assistance so we can catch our breath and
our
companies can start to build more generating capacity."

Middleton said the administration's new budget cuts conservation programs,
"So what is Mr. Cheney talking about?"

Locke took part in groundbreaking for a 248-megawatt power plant about 30
miles south of the Capitol on Tuesday.

Cheney denied Inslee's contention that the White House has refused to meet
on
the energy problem. "That is fundamentally not true," he said.

Inslee later shot back that two dozen members of Congress have been
repeatedly denied a joint meeting with Cheney to press their support for price
caps.

"This is a hornet's nest that needs to be stirred," Inslee said in an
interview. "What I am trying to get this administration to understand is that
this is the beginning of the energy crisis, not the end. They see it as some
sort of 45-day problem and it's over.

"They hope some sort of weather fairy will take care of it. They feel they
can draw a wall around California and let it sink into the Pacific Ocean. The
administration does not understand the depth of this crisis, nor do they
understand the potential of it spreading to the entire nation. Alan Greenspan
is
saying that the energy shocks are affecting consumer confidence."

Cheney said environmental groups are jumping to an ill-founded conclusion
that Bush will be an enemy.

"I think we will be perceived as having a balanced approach over time," he
said. "These tend to be emotional issues and people get buzzed up in short
order."

Environmental groups should take a deep breath, he said.

"I don't want to discourage people's expression of what they believe, but we
are in the early stages of the administration and the president and I both
love
the land. We are both westerners and care a lot about the environment and I
would hope people would give us the time to prove ourselves, to show our
commitment to pass the Earth along in better shape than we got it."

Criticism "just goes with the territory," he said.

He said the White House hasn't decided whether the Bonneville Power
Administration can take as much as $500 million in credits from the U.S.
Treasury this year.

The so-called "fish credits" are for costs unrelated to BPA's generation of
hydroelectric power, including salmon restoration, irrigation and recreation.

The credits could be used to offset this year's BPA payment to the
government. BPA owes between $750 million and $800 million as repayment of
federal investments in the massive system that serves the West.

"That was suggested to us, but we haven't made a decision," the vice
president said.

Cheney said the stalemate over China's holding of the crew of the U.S. Navy
reconnaissance plane, home-based in Washington state, is taking a lot of his
time, but that he's also spending plenty of time working on energy, the
budget,
tax relief and other issues.

He said his health is fine, and that he appreciates people asking.

"I can't go to the grocery store without people coming up and asking how I
am."

Blackouts Not Expected

Bay City News

Following two consecutive days of rolling blackouts, California's power
picture looks much brighter today, but conservation is still needed.
The California Independent System Operator is urging consumers to continue
conservation measures during today's Stage One Electrical Emergency.
"The conservation efforts of Californians, particularly Tuesday evening, were
significant and helped to reduce the duration and impact of yesterday's
blackouts,'' according to officials. "The California ISO asks customers to
continue their voluntary reductions during this time of tight supply."
More than 11,500 megawatts of in-state generation remain unavailable with
power plants completing repairs and needed maintenance. However, several
generating units returned to service today and the level of imported power
has increased, boosting the supply.
"The ISO is cautiously optimistic that customer outages will be avoided
today,'' according to officials.
Today's Stage One alert is in effect through midnight tonight.
Stage One Emergencies are declared when power reserves fall below 7 percent.
Stage Two kicks in when reserves fall below 5 percent. Stage Three is
initiated when reserves drop to below 1.5 percent.

Calif State Controller:General Fund Surplus Dn To $3.2B


03/21/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California State Controller Kathleen Connell
Wednesday said the state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion
from $8.5 billion in January, mostly because of electricity purchases made by
the state's Department of Water Resources, a press release said.
Connell also denied Gov. Gray Davis' request to transfer an additional $5.6
billion from the general fund to the Special Fund for Economic Uncertainties,
the release said.
Connell noted that, given the rapid depletion of the general fund on power
purchases, the state would need to borrow $2.4 billion in order to tranfer
the $5.6 billion from the general fund to the special fund.
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has
taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity
purchases would put the fund at risk," Connell said.

Connell called on Davis to ensure that the CDWR completes by the end of May
2001 the revenue bond sales that will be used to buy power and repay the
general fund.
She also asked that the CDWR notify her of all power purchases made and
contracts negotiated thus far and requested that she be told within 7 days of
any purchases and contracts negotiated in the future.
Connell also said she wanted to be told within 24 hours of any power buys
that exceed $55 million and asked that the Department of Finance be directed
to prepare new general fund cash flow estimates for the next 30 and 60 days,
and for the end of the fiscal year.
The state's Department of Water Resources has been buying power since January
in lieu of Edison International (EIX) utility Southern California Edison and
PG&E Corp (PCG) utility Pacific Gas and Electric Co, because suppliers
refused to sell to the nearly-bankrupt utilities.

Gov. Davis' office said, in response to Connell's comments, that the state
budget was solid and the economy remained strong.
"We will be getting the money back we've paid for energy and it should have
no significant effect on the state's finances from the Wall Street
perspective," said Davis press secretary Steve Maviglio.

Davis says regulators will act to pay QFs
Electricity providers insist they need to be paid
By Russ Britt, CBS.MarketWatch.com
Last Update: 9:45 PM ET Mar 20, 2001
LOS ANGELES (CBS.MW) - California Gov. Gray Davis said regulators will act
Tuesday on a plan to guarantee that independent power generators are paid.
Independent power producers provide about 30 percent of California's
electricity from a variety of sources including wind, solar and other
sources. Because many of the companies, known as Qualifying Facilities, or
QFs, haven't been paid they've begun to withhold power, contributing to
blackouts in the state Monday and Tuesday.
"We are anxious to pay the QFs because they're falling like flies," Davis
said at a news conference late Tuesday. "If they don't get paid, the lights
will go out."
Davis said the state's PUC order will require the state's nearly bankrupt
utilities to enter five-year contracts with the QFs at rates of 7.9 cents per
kilowatt hour, or 10-year contracts for lower rates. The structure is similar
to rates Davis claims he was able to negotiate for long-term power contracts
from out-of-state generators.

Rash power bill may need fix
By Will Shuck
From our Sacramento Bureau
SACRAMENTO Even as lawmakers lament the slow pace of solving California's
energy crisis, the cost of haste has cropped up in their first major act, a
multibillion dollar measure that put the state in the power-buying business.

AB1X, the highly touted bill that put California in the power-buying
business, may have been so rashly crafted that it will take another piece of
legislation to fix it, an influential senator said Tuesday.
At issue is vague wording that makes it unclear when and to what extent
Southern California Edison and other utilities have to repay the state for
buying power.
State Sen. Debra Bowen, chairwoman of the Senate Energy, Utilities and
Communications Committee, said the bill apparently has left room for utility
lawyers to argue that their companies needn't repay the state until they have
covered other costs.
But Bowen, a Redondo Beach Democrat who represents downtown and western Long
Beach, said "the legislative intent is crystal clear" that the state wanted
to be repaid directly for supplying about a third of the power utility
companies deliver to their customers.
"We need a cleanup bill" to set the matter straight, she said.
Although AB1X illustrates the flaws that come with speed, Bowen said, the
Legislature can't afford to delay.
"I think we are much too slow in our response," she said. "But that has to be
balanced against things we've done in a tearing hurry and then have had to
fix later."
No matter what the Legislature does in the coming weeks, she said, California
is in for a tough summer, and only determined conservation efforts will put
much of a dent in a precarious supply-demand equation.

PUC considers rewarding producers that sign long-term contracts
Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau
Wednesday, March 21, 2001
,2001 San Francisco Chronicle
Sacramento -- Some cash-strapped producers of wind, solar and other
alternative forms of energy will get long-delayed financial relief under a
proposed order by state regulators, Gov. Gray Davis said yesterday evening.
A proposed order by the Public Utilities Commission is designed to reward
energy producers who sign long-term contracts with utilities at lower rates.
Alternative energy producers that voluntarily enter such contracts, which
would start on April 1, would be paid within 15 days, said Davis, who
requested the order. Those that do not would have to wait until the utilities
that buy their power return to solvency.
Davis blasted Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern California Edison for
not paying the alternative generators -- know as qualified facilities, or
"QFs" -- even though the companies have been collecting money through rates.
"It is wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket and withhold the
money designed to compensate the QFs," Davis said. "It's immoral and has to
stop."
Alternative producers -- ranging from massive co-generation facilities at oil
refineries to tiny biomass plants -- produce about a third of the state's
supply of electricity. But many are shutting down because utilities have not
paid them since November.
The loss of some 3,000 megawatts from tapped-out alternative energy producers
contributed to the blackouts that snarled California yesterday and Monday,
according to the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's power
grid.
The PUC's proposed order -- which will be considered at the board's Tuesday
meeting -- offers the generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said.
The order does not address the more than $1 billion already owed to the more
than 600 alternative energy producers around the state. Davis said to favor
one creditor over another in past debt could bring on bankruptcy proceedings
from other creditors.
The Legislature would also need to act to make the order work.
"It is critical to keep these facilities up and online," said Sen. Debra
Bowen, D-Marina del Ray, who estimates that Edison has $1.5 billion in cash
on hand, and PG&E $2.5 billion. "The utilities owe it to the people of the
state to pay them."
Edison said yesterday that it opposed any attempt to place alternative
producers ahead of their other creditors.
But Tom Higgins, a senior vice president for Edison International, which owes
alternative producers some $835 million, said his company was talking to the
governor's office about possible payment structures.
Alternative energy producers, particularly those that use high-priced natural
gas to fire their generators, say that without an immediate infusion of cash
they must close their plants.
"We've been obsessed with the health of the utilities and (have) forgotten
the health of everyone else," said V. John White, legislative director of the
Clean Power Campaign, which lobbies for alternative energy producers.
CalEnergy Operating Corp., which operates eight geothermal plants in the
Imperial Valley producing 268 megawatt hours for Edison has sued the utility
asking to be paid and to be temporarily released from their contract with
Edison which has paid them nothing since November.
CalEnergy has a court hearing tomorrow on its Edison contract. Edison owes
the company $75 million, and the debt increases by $1 million a day.
"We've lived up to our end of the bargain but Edison hasn't. We're now not in
a position to make a property tax payment on April 10 and we're the largest
employer in the county," said Vince Signorotti, CalEnergy's property manager.
Unlike Edison, PG&E is paying its creditors 15 cents on the dollar.
"We have offered over the past five days to prepay for future power not yet
delivered to keep as many of them operating as possible, but the state needs
to decide how its going to divvy up the limited money under the frozen
rates," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.
The PUC's sudden attempt to recast the rates paid to alternative generators
comes after several months of inaction, partly a result of waiting for
legislative negotiations on the issue to conclude. Those negotiations
eventually failed to move forward.

State claims $5.5 billion overcharge: Refunds by wholesale generators sought
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published March 22, 2001)
In its boldest attempt yet to extract refunds from wholesale power
generators, the state's grid operator accused the generators Wednesday of
overcharging Californians by $5.5 billion for electricity since last May.
The state's Independent System Operator, which manages the state's
transmission grid, plans to tell a federal regulatory agency today that power
generators consistently took advantage of their stranglehold on the
California market to ratchet up prices.
The federal agency, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, recently
threatened to order generators to refund $134.8 million for overcharges,
mostly covering January and February. But those refunds amounted to just a
fraction of what the grid operator was seeking. The ISO, which has been
complaining about market abuses for several months, says FERC must do more.
"We're happy that (FERC) took this first step, but we think there's a long
way to go," said Anjali Sheffrin, the ISO's director of market analysis. "As
far as I'm concerned, it's been too little, too late. ... The refunds they
have acted on (so far) have been minimal."
She said the report covers five major power suppliers and 16 other power
importers.
FERC Commissioner William L. Massey said it would be improper for him to
comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the $5.5
billion total, Massey told the Los Angeles Times: "That doesn't shock me in
any way."
"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said.
However, most FERC critics are skeptical that the federal agency, which is a
strong believer in letting free markets run their course, would order a
refund anywhere near as large as $5.5 billion -- even though it has found
that California prices at times have been "unjust and unreasonable."
The big power generators, saying their charges were reasonable, are disputing
the $134.8 million refunds proposed so far and have vowed to fight the ISO's
latest effort.
If the ISO were to prevail, the $5.5 billion in refunds could go a long way
toward remedying California's energy mess.
They could help restore the financial health of Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
and Southern California Edison, which have nearly been bankrupted by the
prices charged by the power generators. They also could ease the strain on
the state treasury, which is spending billions to purchase electricity for
Californians because PG&E and Edison can't.
Sheffrin said her department studied sales made by the power generators to
ISO, which makes last-minute power purchases to balance supply with demand,
and the California Power Exchange, the now-bankrupt entity where most of
California's wholesale electricity was bought and sold until December.
She said the study made "very generous" allowances for natural gas expenses,
costly air-pollution credits and other factors, including the scarcity of
electricity. The result was $5.5 billion worth of charges "in excess of
competitive costs," she said.
In many cases, the companies used their market clout to submit bids that were
"way beyond their costs," she said.
"It was insufficient competition," Sheffrin said. "They got away with a lot."
She said the refund request isn't just a shot in the dark. FERC, she noted,
"has already found that prices in the California wholesale energy market have
been unreasonable. We took it upon ourselves ... to show FERC how they got to
be so high."
FERC proposed refunds totaling $124 million for January and February sales,
declaring that generators' prices were too high.
In a separate case the federal agency, for the first time, accused two
generators last week of taking plants offline to force prices up.

Power solution eludes Davis: Lawmakers grow edgy as crisis drags on
By Emily Bazar and Amy Chance
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 22, 2001)
Gov. Gray Davis likes to compare the state's energy crisis to a complicated
"three-cornered" billiard shot.
But as California plunged into another round of power blackouts this week,
Davis has yet to line up the angle on an ultimate solution.
The state's short-term power bill is nearing $4.2 billion, and legislators
are balking at the administration's requests for additional money.
Getting even the least controversial pieces of the puzzle through the
Legislature is taking weeks longer than expected.
While the Democratic governor has insisted secrecy about details of his power
purchases is necessary to protect the state's bargaining position, other
state officials are complaining vigorously about the lack of information.
And critical deals the governor hoped to reach with energy suppliers and
utility companies are proving difficult to close.
"I think we all got lulled into a little complacency a few weeks ago. All
these things seemed to be going along, and the governor was making all these
warm and fuzzy comments," said Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine.
"But it only takes one deal to go sideways and we're all blacked out," he
added. "The governor is running around basically saying, 'Trust me.' I'm not
sure he's deserving of the trust at this point."
Davis and his aides insist they are working around the clock on plans to
boost power generation, encourage conservation and reach an agreement with
utilities that will keep them out of bankruptcy.
The utility plan, they say, is the equivalent of a large corporate merger
that simply can't be accomplished overnight. Davis notes that earlier
deregulation efforts might have benefitted from a little more time.
Although the state has reached a broad "agreement in principle" with Southern
California Edison to obtain its power transmission lines in exchange for help
paying off its debts, a final, detailed deal has not been reached. The
initial agreement with Edison was announced Feb. 23.
And the governor has yet to achieve a tentative agreement with Pacific Gas
and Electric Co., which is driving a harder bargain over price and other
elements of a potential rescue plan.
Joseph Fichera, one of several consultants receiving more than $11 million
from the administration for advice on the energy crisis, said many people
don't realize the complexity of the deal they're brokering.
In their bid to achieve a public takeover of the investor-owned utilities'
transmission lines, he said, negotiators have to pore over thousands of
documents related to the transmission lines alone.
"We are doing what is normal in a transaction of this magnitude, which is
investigate, document, circulate, redocument, agree, move forward," said
Fichera, an investment banker with Saber Partners in New York City. "The
governor has put a 'I want this yesterday' fire" under his negotiating team.
The negotiator, however, declined to say when he expects final agreements to
be reached with the companies.
"It could be days, it could be weeks," he said.
There were signs, meanwhile, of trouble brewing on another front: the giant
bond sale the state must make to repay the money it has spent so far on
electricity and to finance future long-term contracts for energy.
State Treasurer Phil Angelides said Wednesday the utilities are appealing a
ruling by the state Public Utilities Commission that essentially ensures the
state will be repaid, a move that he said threatens to delay the sale
indefinitely.
"If the utilities have decided to adopt a scorched earth policy until they
get what they need and want, then it will be a significant problem,"
Angelides said.
PG&E spokesman Ron Low said the governor is simply placing too many demands
on a rate structure that doesn't compensate the utilities for their current
costs.
"Political rhetoric is not going to change the math," he said.
In the Legislature, lawmakers are growing grumpier. Most were taken by
surprise Monday when blackouts were ordered across the state, weeks before
summer temperatures were expected to set in and strain the power system.
"I'm more worried than ever," said Assemblyman Bill Leonard, R-San
Bernardino. "A lot of the elements we thought we had a handle on in January
are unraveling."
A deal the governor said had been worked out weeks ago between the state and
more than 600 small alternative energy suppliers collapsed last week.
The alternative generators have not been paid by the utilities for months,
and state leaders attempted to bargain down the price utilities pay those
generators for power.
But administration officials complained privately that lawmakers instead
sweetened the pot for the suppliers to the point that the measure no longer
helped solve the overall financial situation pushing the utilities toward
bankruptcy. Under a proposal announced Tuesday by Davis, the Legislature
would authorize the PUC to require the utilities to pay the alternative
suppliers at prices more closely resembling the original deal.
But the governor ran into immediate opposition, as some suppliers said said
he would not pay them enough to cover their fuel costs.
"We would go from not being paid, to losing money," said Hal Dittmer of
Wellhead Electric, a Sacramento-based supplier that has been shut down for
more than a month. "Almost everybody who burns natural gas is going to shut
down. (Davis) got it wrong."
Democrats outside the Davis administration, meanwhile, are complaining about
the amount of money the state Department of Water Resources is spending on
expensive, last-minute power purchases. Within a week, $4.2 billion will have
been committed.
State Sen. Steve Peace, D-El Cajon, chairman of the joint Legislative Budget
Committee, is warning the Davis administration that he will block additional
funds for last-minute purchases of power until the PUC makes progress
recovering money that already has been spent. He intends to hold a hearing on
the issue this morning.
On Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell told Davis she will refuse to
make a routine budget transfer he had requested, saying she is concerned that
there is "no outside check and balance" on the money the administration is
spending to buy electricity on the spot market.
As the statewide elected official who pays the state's bills, Connell said
she has yet to receive information from the Department of Water Resources
about how much it is spending.
"We really need an accounting as to the total amount of liability they have
accumulated," she said. "I understand they're in an emergency situation ...
but it begins to imperil the state's ability to manage its cash flow."
Meanwhile, a bill to provide $1 billion for conservation programs, aimed at
reducing power needs this summer, also has languished for several weeks in
the state Senate. While Davis has focused his attention elsewhere, Republican
lawmakers have opposed the measure as too expensive. Democrats argue that
each two-week delay prevents the state from saving as much energy as one
"peaker" plant will produce this summer. Peaker plants are designed to help
meet the peaks of electricity demand.
"I'm the eternal optimist, but we have to keep working on all fronts," said
Sen. Byron Sher, D-Palo Alto, who hopes to take his energy conservation bill
up for a vote in the Senate again today. "It's a formidable challenge."

Legislators learn some details of power contracts
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published March 22, 2001)
The veil of secrecy surrounding the state's electricity contracts lifted
Wednesday -- a little.
Gov. Gray Davis gave state legislators a report laying out some of the
details of long-term contracts designed to help the state pull out of its
energy crisis. But the report left legislators and others clamoring for more.
"The information raises more questions," said Assemblyman George Runner,
R-Lancaster. "I liken it to watching a parade through a knothole in a fence.
You get to look at one float, but you're not sure about what's coming up and
what you've missed."
Davis had previously disclosed that the state had signed or was close to
signing 40 long-term contracts, at an average price over 10 years of $69 per
megawatt-hour.
The contracts are part of the state's strategy for trying to avoid a fiscal
shellacking in the energy spot market while making sure there's enough
electricity to avoid more blackouts.
Davis also previously disclosed that the contracts were for an average of
about 9,000 megawatts a year, and that the total cost exceeded $40 billion.
But Davis has resisted telling more, saying the state would jeopardize its
ability to get the best prices if electricity generators knew what their
counterparts were getting.
On Wednesday, the governor's office released a March 15 report from S. David
Freeman, general manager of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, to
the state Department of Water Resources. The state agency has been given the
responsibility of making power purchases, and Freeman was brought in to lead
the negotiations.
As of March 15, the state had signed 19 contracts with seven suppliers for
periods ranging from 14 months to 20 years, with many for three or five
years, the report says. Some of the contracts are for electricity to meet the
state's everyday power demand, while others are only for times of peak use,
such as hot summer days.
The state had "agreements in principle" for an additional 25 contracts.
Runner said he has been told that two of these contracts have since been
finalized.
The amount of power provided reaches a peak in 2004 of more than 10,000
megawatts. As the long-term contracts start to expire around then, the state
is hoping that demand can be met with new contracts or spot purchases at
prices expected to be much cheaper.
The report says nine more long-term contracts were under discussion.
Some of the contracts are with power generators, while others are with
marketers who may get the power from a number of sources.
In some cases, the state may supply the natural gas used to generate the
electricity, or power costs may be pegged to the going rate for the fuel.
Some suppliers can cancel if the state fails to sell bonds by a certain date
to cover power costs or fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating.
Some depend on the construction of power plants, but Freeman said they were
firm commitments.
"We were pretty careful not to put a hope and a dream in the portfolio," he
said.
More contracts will have to be signed to meet summer demand, and these
agreements will probably be more expensive, the report says.
One item not in Freeman's report was a secret deal to relieve several major
generators from having to pay for polluting the air beyond allowable limits.
The long-term power contracts include language that would have the state pay
the costs of "pollution credits" that allow power plants to exceed their
permitted levels of smog-forming pollutants, the governor's office confirmed
Wednesday. Spokesman Steve Maviglio said that several generators are being
relieved from having to pay those costs.
V. John White, a Sierra Club lobbyist close to the negotiations, said Dynegy
Inc., which has power plants in El Segundo, Encina and Long Beach, is one of
them. Dynegy officials did not return calls to The Bee on Wednesday.
Freeman said that generators were demanding hefty premiums for having to deal
with air quality regulators in the summer and he figured it would be cheaper
just to pay for the pollution credits.
In other energy-related developments:
With more power plants back online, grid operators dropped down to a Stage 1
electricity alert. The state Independent System Operator was expecting
supplies to gradually increase over the next few days.
The state Public Utilities Commission issued a revised draft decision that
would impose the prices outlined Tuesday by Davis for power produced by
alternative energy companies -- $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year contracts
or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years. The proposal is scheduled for a PUC vote
March 27.
A federal judge ruled that one of the nation's major electricity generators
must continue supplying California with emergency power.
In imposing an injunction on Reliant Energy Services Inc., U.S. District
Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. noted the "rolling blackouts (that have) darkened
the California landscape" and said the loss of Reliant's production "poses an
imminent threat."
Bee staff writers Carrie Peyton, Chris Bowman and Denny Walsh contributed to

Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California




By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 21, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday
ordering a major electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California
despite its fear that it will not get paid.
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO
buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try
to fend off blackouts.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.
The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by
suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.








Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health
Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power




The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the
costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said.
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three
other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling
to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring
the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order,
requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue
sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling.
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out,
enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for
roughly 750 homes.
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant
said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most
of the power is committed under long-term contracts.
Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it
won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison.
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June
due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996
deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers.
At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part
to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight
hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest.
Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state
Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed
the state to avoid blackouts.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also
imperils California's financial health.
Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is
gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power
buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2
billion, she said.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its
power-buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.
"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand
that kind of audit information," Harrison said.
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the
$10 billion in long-term debt.
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity
purchases.
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money."
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering
challenging Davis next year.
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with
wholesalers.

Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 21, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) California's power-buying on behalf of two strapped utilities is
gutting its budget surplus and putting the state at financial risk, the state
controller said Wednesday.
The surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the state began buying
electricity for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison,
to $3.2 billion now, Kathleen Connell estimates.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Gov. Gray Davis
is withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
Wednesday marked the first time in three days the state avoided rolling
blackouts. Power grid officials credited cooling temperatures and the
completion of repairs at several power plants.
Connell said the energy crunch now imperils the state's budget as well as its
electric grid.
California has been spending about $45 million a day ) $4.2 billion so far )
to buy power for Edison and PG&E, both denied credit by electricity
wholesalers.
The two utilities, California's largest, say they are nearly $14 billion in
debt due to soaring wholesale power costs the state's deregulation law blocks
them from recovering from customers.
Meanwhile, the state has faced high natural gas costs and a tight power
supply driven in part by power plant repairs in California and scarce
hydroelectric power in the Pacific Northwest.
Standard & Poor's has put the state on a credit watch due to its power
purchases and chastised Davis, the Legislature and state regulators for not
taking more aggressive steps to assure the utilities can pay their bills.
On Wednesday, Connell said she is refusing a request by Davis and the
Legislature to transfer $5.6 billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set
up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10 billion in
revenue bonds to cover its power-buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.

that kind of audit information," Harrison said.
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the
$10 billion in long-term debt.
Connell said the scope of the proposed transfer is unprecedented and amounts
to a "shell game" that disguises the power purchases' impact on the state
budget.
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity
purchases.
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money."
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering
challenging Davis next year.
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details. He said his
plan may involve giving the utilities low-interest loans with their
transmission lines held as collateral.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with

Governor says utilities must pay in advance for some power



By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 21, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) The state's two largest utilities will be ordered to pay
environmentally friendly power generators in advance, a move Gov. Gray Davis
hopes will bring a quick end to the power blackouts that darkened California
this week.
The statewide blackouts that stretched from San Diego to Oregon on Monday and
Tuesday were caused in part by the failure of Southern California Edison and
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. to pay millions of dollars they owe "qualifying
facilities" or QFs, Davis said.
Such suppliers use cogeneration ) steam from manufacturing plus natural gas )
or solar, wind and other renewable energy to generate electricity. This week
California lost about half the power those generators normally provide.








Controller: State's power spending imperils its financial health




Several of them said they hadn't been paid by Edison and PG&E in weeks and
can't afford to keep operating their plants.
Davis accused the utilities of taking in money from customers while failing
to pay the QFs. The state has been spending about $45 million a day since
January to buy power for customers of Edison and PG&E, which are so
credit-poor that suppliers refuse to sell to them.
"It's wrong and irresponsible of the utilities to pocket this money and not
pay the generators," the governor said at a Capitol news conference Tuesday
evening. "They've acted irresponsibly and immorally and it has to stop."
PG&E called the governor's statements "inappropriate and unjustified," adding
that it was negotiating a payment plan with the QFs. Edison said it is intent
on paying creditors and working with the California Public Utilities
Commission to pay QFs for future power sales.
Controller Kathleen Connell warned Wednesday that the state's $2
billion-a-month power purchases are jeopardizing California's budget.
The state's budget surplus dropped from $8.5 billion in January, when the
power purchases began, to $3.2 billion now, Connell estimates. She blamed
Davis for withholding key financial information, and ordered an audit of the
state's power spending starting next week.
She blocked a request by the Legislature and Davis administration to transfer
$5.6 billion from the state's general fund into a special "rainy day" fund,
saying that would have left the general fund $2.4 billion in debt.
The Legislative Analyst's Office said such transfers are routine; Connell
agreed, but said the size of the transfer is unprecedented.
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus," Connell said. "The
energy crisis has taken much of that away and this transfer on top of the
electricity purchases would put the fund at risk."
Meanwhile, keepers of the state's power grid were optimistic California would
get through Wednesday without another day of rolling blackouts. Two plants
down for repairs returned to service.
Several power plants that were taken down for repairs are also expected come
online by the end of the week, reducing the likelihood of blackouts, said Jim
Detmers, ISO vice president.
Power may flow to homes and businesses, but it could soon cost consumers
more, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, one of the Legislature's leaders on
energy issues.
"I think it's intellectually appropriate and honest to tell people as soon as
it's apparent" that a rate increase is warranted, the Boulder Creek Democrat
said Tuesday, indicating that time had come.
He estimated that the state Public Utilities Commission may soon have to
raise rates by about 15 percent to cover the state's costs and its utilities'
bills.
"My sense is that people will appreciate having some certainty and being able
to plan for it," he said. "They don't have to like it but I think they'll
appreciate it."
Davis said he is confident the utilities and the state can pay their bills
without further rate increases for Edison and PG&E customers.
In the meantime, the Independent System Operator, keeper of the grid, is
counting on continued conservation by residents and businesses to avoid more
blackouts. Conservation accounted for about 300 megawatts in savings during
Tuesday's peak usage, enough to power 300,000 homes.
Roughly a half-million homes and businesses were affected by Tuesday's
blackouts, which snarled traffic and plunged schools and businesses into
darkness across the state.
The outages began at 9:30 a.m. and continued in 90-minute waves until about 2
p.m., when the ISO lifted its blackout order. They were blamed for at least
one serious traffic accident.
Two cars collided at an intersection in the Los Angeles suburb of South El
Monte where the traffic lights were out. Two people were seriously hurt, said
California Highway Patrol Officer Nick Vite.
In San Francisco's Chinatown, souvenir shops normally bustling with visitors
were forced to shut down. Nearby, irritated customers waited for a bank to
reopen.
The blackouts, like Monday's, were caused by a combination of problems,
including unseasonably warm weather, reduced electricity imports from the
Pacific Northwest and numerous power plants being shut down for repairs.
Adding to those troubles, the state lost about 3,100 megawatts from the QF
plants.
Senate Energy Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, estimated
Tuesday that Edison has amassed more than $1 billion and PG&E more than $2
billion that they have not paid to generators.
Davis said the PUC planned to issue an order next week directing the
utilities to pre-pay their future QF bills.
PG&E said its prepayments hinge on an upcoming PUC decision on whether the
utility's rates are sufficient to pay its bills and cover the state's power
purchases on its behalf, which amount to $4.2 billion since early January.
Edison and PG&E say they have lost more than $13 billion since last June to
climbing wholesale electricity prices, which the state's 1996 deregulation
law prevents them from passing on to ratepayers.

Energy Overcharge of $5.5 Billion Is Alleged

Power: Money should be refunded to taxpayers and utilities, the state grid
operator says, citing evidence of market manipulation. Suppliers deny the
accusation.

By TIM REITERMAN and NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writers

Wholesale electricity suppliers overcharged California by about $5.5
billion between May and last month, and that money should be refunded to the
state's taxpayers and financially strapped utilities, the state power grid
operator said Wednesday.
Generators engaged in market manipulation and consistent patterns of
bidding far above costs in the deregulated energy market, the California
Independent System Operator found in a study of pricing data. The findings
support the widespread belief that these suppliers reaped massive additional
revenue by manipulating the market.
Spokesmen for the companies denied the accusation.
The study, prepared for a filing with federal regulators today, is
central to Cal-ISO's efforts to seek reimbursement for what it considers
excessive charges by electricity suppliers during the state's energy crisis.
"This might be the first time we told them the total impact and
magnitude [of the overcharging]," said Anjali Sheffrin, Cal-ISO's director of
market analysis. "We think the entire amount deserves consideration for
refunds."
Using confidential bidding data on tens of thousands of electricity
sales, Cal-ISO found that five companies that together supply about 30% of
the power delivered to customers of the state's investor-owned utilities
engaged in two types of behavior that tended to push up prices:
* They effectively withheld supplies by bidding at excessive prices,
even though they could have made some money selling more electricity.
* Less frequently, they had power generation available but did not bid
at all.
The study concluded that energy suppliers commonly offered their
electricity at twice their cost. For example, Sheffrin said, the average
markup in August was 100% during peak hours.
A spokeswoman at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which
oversees wholesale electricity pricing across the country, declined to
comment Wednesday, saying, "This is part of an ongoing proceeding."
FERC member William L. Massey, who has considered previous commission
actions on refunds to be inadequate, said it would be improper for him to
comment on a report that has not yet been filed. But when told of the
$5.5-billion total, Massey said: "That doesn't shock me in any way."
"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said.
Cal-ISO, which oversees grid operations and an emergency energy market,
previously detailed $550 million in alleged overcharges for December and
January and asked FERC for refunds. But the commission has proposed refunds
of only a tiny fraction of that amount.
The study covered five major in-state power suppliers--Reliant Energy,
Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, formerly Southern Energy--plus
16 power importers, all of which deliver power to customers of Pacific Gas &
Electric Co., Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
"All [21] overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate
amounts," Sheffrin said.
Cal-ISO's public filing will quantify the alleged overcharging by each
company, but the companies will be identified only by a number. The code will
be provided to FERC, Sheffrin said, and Cal-ISO lawyers will determine how
much information about the companies will be made public.

State, U.S. Investigations
California electricity markets and the companies that buy and sell power
in the state have been the subject of several investigations by state and
federal authorities since wholesale electricity prices first skyrocketed in
May.
Electricity suppliers have repeatedly denied manipulating the California
market in any way, whether through above-cost bidding in spot markets or
through physical withholding of electricity to drive up prices.
Reliant Energy is cooperating with FERC's requests for more data and is
confident the commission will conclude that prices charged by Reliant were
justified, said Joe Bob Perkins, president of the Houston-based company.
Perkins also bitterly disputed charges that Reliant has shut down units
so that it can earn bigger profits on the power sold by the remaining plants.
These charges have been leveled against all of the power-plant owners in the
state.
Reliant Vice President John Stout said Cal-ISO's calculations typically
don't include such fixed costs as salaries, taxes and the interest on bonds
they sold to finance their power plants, which they acquired under terms of
the state's landmark 1996 deregulation law.
In addition, he said, many high-priced power days have resulted from
buyers bidding against each other for scarce supplies rather than sellers
charging excessive amounts--like a house price being driven far above the
listing price in a hot real estate market.
Williams Energy Services, a trading company that markets most of the
power produced by plants owned by AES, also says it will be exonerated by
FERC once the commission examines documentation being submitted, said Paula
Hill-Collins, spokeswoman for the Tulsa, Okla., company.
"FERC has the obligation to investigate when these accusations are
made," Hill-Collins said. "This is just a process of justification, not
necessarily proof of guilt."
Williams/AES was recently ordered by FERC to prove that it did not take
generating units out of service last year to drive up electricity prices, or
refund $10.8 million to California utilities.
During the period studied, suppliers sold electricity in the California
Power Exchange to Southern California Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. and in a backup market for last-minute electricity operated by
Cal-ISO. But sky-high prices plunged Edison and PG&E deeply into debt, and
most suppliers stopped selling to them in January, forcing the state
Department of Water Resources to step in as the primary electricity buyer for
the three big utilities' 27 million customers.
The Cal-ISO study, first summarized at an energy conference last week at
UC Berkeley but not otherwise publicized, concluded that the companies
exercised so-called market power to pump up electricity prices.
Severin Borenstein, director of the Energy Institute at Berkeley, said
Cal-ISO's study is consistent with his research examining pricing practices
in 2000.
"We found several billion dollars . . . in departures from competitive
pricing," he said. "When the market was tight this summer, they were able to
push up prices, and they did."
The early warning signs of electricity price spikes, the study found,
appeared in May after two years of relatively stable prices of $30 to $40 per
megawatt-hour under deregulation. Prices went up during the summer, dipped in
September and October with lower demand, then took off in November and
December as weather turned cold and the price of natural gas, which is used
to generate much of the state's electricity, reached record levels.
"There were plant outages, and demand and supply became close," Sheffrin
said. "Whatever price they bid had to be taken, and market power asserted
itself."
Cal-ISO found that $3 billion of the alleged overcharges occurred
between May and November.
On Friday, federal regulators ordered six wholesale power suppliers to
refund $55 million to California if they cannot justify prices charged in
February. The refund was limited to power sold that month in excess of $430
per megawatt-hour during Stage 3 power alerts, when supplies are so tight
that rolling blackouts are threatened. (One megawatt-hour is enough
electricity to supply 750 typical homes for an hour.)
The previous week, FERC ordered 13 suppliers to justify or refund $69
million for power sold in January at prices above $273 per megawatt-hour.
Massey opposed the potential refunds as too low because they were
limited to hours in which a Stage 3 power emergency was in place and because
the benchmark price set for each month was too high--combining to exempt more
than 70,000 transactions from scrutiny.
"We're still looking for our lost wallet under the lamppost, which is
Stage 3 alerts," said Massey, one of three commissioners on the five-member
board (two seats are vacant).
Generators "have been given the free and clear," he said.
"These tinkling little refunds they have come out with recently are
almost a joke," said Cal-ISO board member Mike Florio, senior attorney at the
Utility Reform Network.

Resisting Price Caps
Cal-ISO contends that the last 10 months have proved that generators can
no longer be allowed to receive electricity prices that are dictated by what
the market will bear.
"FERC granted market-based rate authority on each of these suppliers'
own showing that they could not manipulate prices, yet their actions have
shown the contrary," Sheffrin said. "We feel FERC needs to look at the
premise of allowing these generators to continue selling at market-based
rates."
The commission is responsible for ensuring just and reasonable
electricity rates. Although it has called California's power market
dysfunctional and vulnerable to manipulation, the agency has resisted setting
firm price caps sought by California's congressional delegation.
Chairman Curt L. Hebert Jr. strongly opposes caps, while Massey wants to
use caps across the West as a "temporary timeout."
Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, in a New York news conference
Wednesday, reiterated his opposition to electricity price caps as a way to
cope with California's energy crisis.
"If we put price caps in place, there will be more blackouts, and
they'll be worse," Abraham said.
Cal-ISO is filing its market study as part of its comments on FERC staff
recommendations on ways to thwart market manipulation. FERC's proposal
includes strict coordination of power plant outages by Cal-ISO with reporting
of suspicious closures to FERC, and generator-by-generator bid caps tied to
costs.

Power Strain Eases but Concerns Mount

Energy: Officials say summer prices will be high, and a state report shows
that contracts with generators are far short of goals.

By DAN MORAIN and JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writers

SACRAMENTO--California's fragile electricity system stabilized
Wednesday, but a Davis administration report suggested troubles ahead because
the state could be forced to buy most of its power for the coming summer on
the costly and volatile spot market.
After two days of statewide blackouts, power plants that had been shut
down were cranked up. Unseasonable heat tapered off. The operators of the
statewide power grid relaxed their state of emergency.
But plenty of ominous signs remained. Many small producers remained shut
down, skeptical about Gov. Gray Davis' plan for utilities to pay them.
State Controller Kathleen Connell issued a sharp warning about the high
cost of the state's foray into the power business and announced that she will
block an administration request that she transfer $5.6 billion into an
account that could be tapped to pay for state purchases of electricity.
And a report from the administration summarizing contracts between Davis
and independent power generators showed that the state has signed contracts
for only 2,247 megawatts of electricity, significantly less than the 6,000 to
7,000 megawatts previously claimed.
While there are agreements in principle for the full amount, the report
notes that generators can back out of the contracts for a variety of reasons,
including the state's failure to sell bonds to finance power purchased by
July 1. The Legislature has approved plans to sell $10 billion in bonds, but
none have yet been issued.
"We are exposed enormously this summer," Senate Energy Committee
chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) said after looking at the report.
"We owe the people the truth about how difficult this summer is going to be.
We don't have a power fairy."
Perhaps most significant, the report suggests that the contracts fall
significantly short of Davis' stated goal of buying no more than 5% of the
state's summer needs on the spot electricity market, where prices can be many
times those of long-term contracts.
After reading the report, Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist
who studies the California electricity market, said the numbers suggested
that the state's long-term contracts will cover less than half of what the
state will need this summer.
"We're definitely short this summer, next summer and the summer of
2003," he said.
California was forced to start buying electricity in December--at a cost
of $50 million a day--because producers refused to sell to Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. The two utilities amassed
billions of dollars in debt when prices for wholesale power soared on the
spot market.
Vikram Budhraja, a consultant retained by Davis to negotiate deals with
generators, said the report represents a "work in progress." He said the
state may yet sign new contracts.
However, Wolak said the contract figures confirm what he and others have
been dreading: that summer is going to be rife with rolling blackouts unless
serious steps to cut demand are taken immediately.
Wolak and other experts say large industrial customers must be switched
to real-time meters and pricing to persuade them to use the bulk of their
energy at times of low demand.
The head of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based nonprofit that
promotes sustainable sources of power, made the same proposal to Davis on
Wednesday.
"The government need not ask customers to swelter in the dark this
summer," foundation President Hal Harvey argued in a letter.
He also proposed a crash campaign to boost sales of efficient appliances
and lightbulbs. He said the state needs to take over the utilities' contracts
with alternative energy providers to ensure they stay in business, and sign
new contracts for 1,500 megawatts of new wind power--the cheapest, fastest
and cleanest source of new supply.
Davis had proposed a formula Tuesday to force private utilities to pay
the alternative producers, some of which have not been paid since November.
But some of them warned Wednesday that Davis' plan offers them little
incentive to turn on their generators.
Alternative energy producers supply more than a quarter of the
electricity consumed in California.
Many producers generate electricity from wind, sun and geothermal
sources. But most of them generate power using natural gas--and the cost of
natural gas has been soaring. Several natural gas users said Davis' plan,
which caps rates, won't cover their fuel costs.
Davis assumes that the price of natural gas will fall. But small
generators say they don't have sufficient purchasing power or sophistication
to gamble on future prices.
The Public Utilities Commission is expected to approve Davis' proposal
next week. It offers producers two choices: 7.9 cents a kilowatt-hour if they
agree to supply power for five years, or 6.9 cents a kilowatt-hour over 10
years.
"The price of natural gas is higher than that," said Marty Quinn,
executive vice president and chief operating officer of Ridgewood Power LLC,
which owns three natural gas-fired co-generation plants. "If we operate,
we'll lose money."
Ridgewood is not operating, having been cut off by gas suppliers. The
company sued PG&E last month seeking overdue payments and release from its
contracts with the utility.
A hearing is scheduled in El Centro today in another lawsuit filed by a
small energy producer, an Imperial Valley geothermal producer that sued
Edison for refusing to let it break its contract and sell on the open market.
CalEnergy says Edison owes it about $140 million for energy sold since
November.
A company spokesman, Jay Lawrence, said CalEnergy was going ahead with
its suit despite Davis' proposal. "We've had promises before," he said.
In other developments:
* A federal judge in Sacramento on Wednesday ordered Reliant Energy of
Houston, a major producer, to continue selling power to California during
emergencies, despite the company's argument that it may not be fully
reimbursed. The order will remain in effect for 60 days or until the U.S.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission decides a related case.
* Connell said the state budget surplus has shrunk to $3.2 billion
because the state has spent roughly $2.8 billion on electricity. She
criticized the administration for withholding basic information about state
finances, and said she will begin an audit on Monday of the Department of
Water Resources, which is responsible for purchasing power.
Davis' aides said Connell took her action because the Democratic
governor endorsed one of Connell's foes this week in the race for Los Angeles
mayor, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa. A Connell aide scoffed
at the notion.
* Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she "never has had a response"
from President Bush after writing him last month for an appointment to
discuss the California energy crisis.
In a wide-ranging lunch talk with reporters in Washington, she deplored
the fact that "huge, huge profits are being made" in the California crisis,
and said "an appropriate federal role" would be to guarantee a reliable
source of power until the state can get nine new generators online.

San Jose, while trying to block construction of a new power plant, is set to
approve a vast computer complex that could overwhelm California's already
strained power grid.
City officials gave preliminary approval last week to what would be the
world's largest "server farm." The sprawling facility to handle Internet

Justin - haven't heard anything else back from Justin B ; as per your
voicemail he is away until 9 April, so suggest you get back in touch with him
then.  I tend to agree with Mark Taylor's view re: perhaps best not to use
'EOL' or 'EOL Manager' and the like given our substantial existing investment
in the brand/trademark 'EnronOnline'.

At the same time, the press are often referring to 'EnronOnline' as 'EOL', so
if the trademark 'EOL' is in fact still available, Kal Shah and I are of the
view that it would make sense to apply for it for possible use,  and also to
preclude others in our market from securing it (though at some stage we would
need to demonstrate use vs. just applying for the trademark itself  for it to
afford us any legal protection).

My concern from a marketing standpoint is not to dilute the 'EnronOnline'
brand or logo by also using the term 'EOL'.   However, if we could secure the
trademark, it would be nice to have the option of using it at our discretion
(e.g. perhaps more so in interviews and press releases , rather than creating
a logo/brand for EOL, which I think we should avoid ).  Clearly though, if
anyone else already has the 'EOL' trademark for the same goods and services
classes we would be looking for, we would need to steer clear of this
entirely to avoid infringing on that trademark.

Happy to discuss this further.

I need help on this one.  I spoke to Gary shortly after he sent this e-mail the other day.  I wasn't sure what to say in the letter regarding how long they would be shut in -- Is there some repair that needs to be done to remedy the situation?  Are we ever going to take the gas again?  Should I tell them that it will remain shut in until the gas meets our specs?
At Gary's suggestion, I called Mike Morris & left a message, but haven't heard back from him.  Therefore, I am sending this e-mail to see if anyone else can give me some advise on the contents of the notification letter that I need to send out.
Thanks in advance for any help that you can give me.

MORE THAN SPEEDING?

A police officer  pulls a guy over for speeding and has the  following
exchange:

Officer: May I see your driver's  license?

Driver: I don't have one. I had it suspended when I  got my 5th DUI.

Officer: May I see the owner's card for this  vehicle?

Driver: It's not my car. I stole  it.

Officer: The car is stolen?

Driver: That's  right. But come to think of it, I think I saw the owner's
card in the  glove box when I was putting my gun in there.

Officer:  There's a gun in the glove box?

Driver: Yes sir. That's where  I put it after I shot and killed the woman
who owns this car and  stuffed her in the trunk.

Officer: There's a BODY in the  TRUNK?!?!?

Driver: Yes, sir.

Hearing this, the  officer immediately called his captain. The car was
quickly  surrounded by police, and the captain approached the driver
to handle  the tense situation:

Captain: Sir, can I see your  license?

Driver: Sure. Here it is.

It was  valid.

Captain: Who's car is this?

Driver:  It's mine, officer. Here's the owner' card.

The driver owned  the car.

Captain: Could you slowly open your glove box so I  can see if there's
a gun in it?

Driver: Yes, sir, but  there's no gun in it.

Sure enough, there was nothing in the  glove box.

Captain: Would you mind opening your trunk? I was  told you said
there's a body in it.

Driver: No  problem.

Trunk is opened; no body.

Captain: I  don't understand it. The officer who stopped you said you
told him  you didn't have a license, stole the car, had a gun in the
glovebox,  and that there was a dead body in the trunk.

Driver: Yeah,  I'll bet he told you I was speeding,  too.

Well, I received a check yesterday and so I was able to reserve us a field
for practice.  But wait, there's more...instead of having one guy hit and the
rest of us standing around watching him, this year I actually have set up
some scrimmages.  So we can actually practice against another team, which
means I would like to have the majority of our team out there.  Here is the
schedule:

Sunday April 8th  1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
Sunday April 15th 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
Sunday April 23rd 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
Saturday April 28th 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM
All practices/scrimmages are at Westmoreland Park Field #2.  Some of you will
remember that this is the field that we played at last summer.  Its the one
next to McLoughlin Blvd (where errant warmup throws would sometimes go) and
where we got flashed by those heinous girls.  If you need directions or a
better description (not of the girls), let me know.

This part is a reminder that I still need money from some of you.  Some have
contacted me to let me know when I can expect a check but I havent heard from
others.  The sooner I can get the rest of the money the sooner I will be able
to purchase bats and balls.

As always, please let me know if anyone has questions or comments.  I will
also be at the batting cages next week, day to be determined, so hopefully I
will see you out there.  Take it easy.

Hi there,

I don't know who has or wants to look at the deal docs, but here's the main
one.  I'm giving it a close look this am, since I haven't been involved in
this deal for a little while.

Herman, this is the transaction we discussed on the phone a couple of weeks
ago.

Lisa and Catherine, I'm pondering the logistics of selling the new turbine in
the pack with the current ones.  I have a call in to Lee Johnson to discuss
it with him, just to make sure he is on board. I know it can be done, we just
have to figure out the paper trail.

Chip, I haven't received the Hancock letter yet.

Stephen, your close review of the document would be greatly appreciated.

Talk to all soon,

Kay

PS.  Anna Claire Sole arrived at 200am today.

See dinner invite below. I am in Amsterdam anyway for meetings 6th and 7th.
ABN Amro are relationship lenders to Enron Europe. Roger Harvey used to be in
project finance team (from where I know him.) He now looks after the bank's
energy clients for UK, NL and Germany. Two or three other companies may be
represented at the dinner. Roger has invited us to dinner on the 6th in the
context of the "Energy in Europe" conference, at which I am speaking 7th am
and chairing a panel discussion among regulators 7th pm.

Before the dinner there will be time for you to meet Prof. Littlechild again
mid-pm (after your train journey from Brussels and Teun's and my lunchtime
session with him) and then hold a review of Dutch developments with Teun.

On morning of 7th you will fly to Paris.

Carlos, I have a bunch of comments and questions on the below.  I have copied
Herman Manis on this since he wasn't part of your distribution and I want him
to read what the sales plan is to insure that he is comfortable with it and
that it agrees with what the originators and legal folks have been telling
him.
Re your email intro:  1.  The amount owed to E-Next does not need to be
included in this Notice.  It must be included in the second notice we must
provide to E-Next for the purchase.  We refer to it as the Prepayment
Notice.  2.  I don't understand the flow of the sales process for this deal.
My last understanding was that it was to be handled like the CA Development
sale.  In that deal, my understanding is that ENA assigned its purchase
option to CA Dev.  The sale of the LLC originally owned by ENA was sold to CA
Dev prior to the $$ flowing to E-Next for the purchase of the equipment.  CA
Dev put the $$ in escrow first then we issued the purchase notice.  Please
advise if this was not the case and why ENA is the entity purchasing the
equipment in this deal.  Has accounting and the originator agreed on the
accounting treatment this transaction will receive based on the sale
process/flow of $$ described below?
Notice of Intent to Purchase:  1.  Since CA Development was completed, the
form of the Notice has been changed to be more detailed with respect to the
underlying financing:
This letter will serve as written notice to the Administrative Agent that
(1) the Development and Construction Manager under the Development and
Construction Management Agreement dated as of December 15, 2000, among E-Next
Generation LLC, the Developer Subsidiaries from time to time parties thereto,
and Enron North America Corp., as Development and Construction Manager (as
such terms are define in such agreement), has designated [name of purchaser
and state of incorpation], as its designee pursuant to Section 6.1(a) of such
Development and Construction Management Agreement, and (2) [purchaser]
intends to purchase the Specified Option Property listed (and as defined) in
Exhibit 1 attached hereto.  The applicable purchase date shall be [insert
date].
The Notice should be signed by ENA with Consent provided by Salmon Energy LLC
as purchaser.
These documents in draft form should be approved by CSFB/Milbank prior to us
sending the Notice.  When the Notice is sent, the execution copies of all
documents associated with the purchase should also be sent to the appropriate
parties.  Sending one package is the most expedient method and most likely to
have the documents executed in the five business days that we need.  Rose
Engeldorf can provide you with the information you need for whom to send it
to.
Exhibit 1 to Notice to Purchase:  As noted above, item 5 can be deleted in
this Notice.  In item 6, please spell out the parties involved in the
Agreement in Principle as "the foregoing parties" can be interpreted to
include WestLB as stated in the May 12, 2000 turbine purchase agreement.  As
we all know, they are not a party to the Ag in Principle.  Also, Kay had been
talking with Rose about perhaps changing the AIP to become a change order to
the existing LM6000 master turbine purchase agreement.  Is this happening?
If so, won't this change this description in every schedule to these purchase
agreements?
Assumption & Assumption Agreement:  This Schedule 1 should mirror the
Schedule 1 in the Bill of Sale.  In Schedule 2, please add an attention line
to Shazia Sarker, CSFB , Phone 212 325 9935.
Bill of Sale:  In first paragraph, please correct E-Next's name.  There
should not be a "I" at the end of it.  Also, insert "the" before the
definition of "Developer".  Schedule 1 needs to have the same changes made as
I discussed above under Notice of Intent to Purchase.
UCC-3s:  Not part of your package but a required document for releasing the
equipment from E-Next to Salmon.  Rose can help you insure that these are
created.
Please provide your comments to the above group along with the next draft of
documents, which should probably be ready for review by CSFB/Milbank.

I have returned a call to Gary Gentile from the AP.  I gave him this
statement and refused further comments on other issues, which included 1)
"what is Enron's actual exposure?", 2) "what was Enron's opinion of Gov.
Davis' speech last night?", and 3) "was this PG&E's only option?"  I did
respond to one follow-up question, which was "what options were available
months ago?"  My answer included the following 1) demand side solutions, 2)
allowing long-term contracting for power supplies, and 3) expediting the
siting process for new supplies.

All,

Attached is a resume for Trevor Woods.  Trevor worked with me at HPL and
directly for me in Technology.  He is outstanding and left to do the dot com
thing with his brother-in-law who was CEO of this company.  He is interested
to come back to Enron and is talking to various people around Enron.  He has
offer opportunities at EBS and EES and has been talking with Billy Lemmons
about ag.  Trevor is great and would be excellent in a Jr. commercial roll in
an origination type of function.

He is interested in moving pretty quickly and if you have an interest please
contact him in the near future.

Shanna can coordinate the times but i recommend him highly and he would be an
asset to EGM.

Mike

The Chief Judge, who is hearing the CPUC complaint case against El Paso, asks
for extension of the procedural schedule due to the complexity of the case.
He expects the hearing to end on June 8.  He proposes 30 days to file briefs,
and 15 days for reply briefs, with Initial Decision due 30 days after that,
or August 24.   Originally, the Commission had ordered that an Initial
Decision be issued by May 28th, later extended to July 12th.

Also asks for guidance as to whether the Commission intended him "to compile
a more complete record on [violations of the marketing affiliate rules] and
make findings as to whether such a violation, if it existed, contributed to
the alleged exercise of market power by El Paso Natural Gas Company and/or El
Paso Merchant Energy".  Maybe El Paso is not in the clear on violating the
marketing affiliate rules after all!!

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


As reported in Tim Taylor's prior email, Judge Moskowitz deferred ruling on
the motion to stay pending resolution of the Section 455 issue.  Judge
Moskowitz rejected plaintiffs' argument that defendants should be required
to formally move to recuse, stating that he felt required to resolve the
Section 455 issue before proceeding further.  On the other hand, he did not
accept our argument that judicial economy favors deferral of the 455 issue
to the MDL Panel, stating instead that he needed to resolve the issue, lest
the Panel designate him as the MDL transferee court for cases he could not
accept.

Judge Moskowitz continued the matter to April 12 at 2:30 pm (PST), at which
time the Court will hear oral argument on both the 455 issue and the stay
motion.  In the interim, the parties will brief the 455 issue in accordance
with the following schedule:

Plaintiff's brief  -  April 2
Defendants' response - April 10
Plaintiff's reply -  April 12

As to the stay motion, Judge Moskowitz indicated he would need to review the
issues raised in the remand briefs before deciding the stay motion.  He
stated that, generally speaking, if the remand motions require substantial
effort and raise issues on which reasonable minds could defer, then he is
inclined to grant a stay, given considerations of judicial economy and the
public's interest in consistent rulings.  While Judge Moskowitz was careful
to note he has not decided this issue, many of the defense counsel who
attended the hearing came away with the impression that the Court is
favorably inclined to the stay arguments.

As to the timing of the remand motion, Judge Moskowitz stated that, if he
does not recuse himself and if he does not stay the cases, the remand motion
will be heard "a couple of weeks" after April 17.   Plaintiffs expressed
concern that the remand motion be heard before the MDL rule in May.  Judge
Moskowitz did not commit to any specific schedule, but appeared receptive to
plaintiffs' position on this timing issue.

A transcript has been ordered and should be available on Monday for
circulation.  Several counsel have suggested that we have a group discussion
after we review the transcript to assess our options on the various issues,
including the Section 455 issue.

As such, we have scheduled a conference call for Wednesday, March 28 at 11
am (PST).  The dial in number is 1-800-210-5603 (pass code 5103596#).  I
will circulate an agenda before the call.

IssueAlert for  March 30, 2001

FERC Chairman Curt HSbert Will Block Western Price Caps

by Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis

[News item from Energy Info Source] Reuters is reporting that Curt HSbert,
FERC Chairman, said he would block a move by fellow commissioners to impose a
temporary price cap on wholesale electricity prices in the western United
States. HSbert reportedly said that even if a majority of the three member
commission favored price caps, he would prevent a vote from being taken
because he does not believe price curbs would increase electricity supplies
or reduce demand in the region. "Absent someone proving to me that price caps
would bring more supply and less demand in California and the West, my answer
is yes," HSbert said, when asked by reporters if he would block a FERC vote
on western price caps. A FERC spokesman later downplayed HSbert's remarks.
"He did not say he would block any vote," said FERC spokesman Hedley Burrell.
"He said he would need to be shown that price caps would bring more supply or
less demand to the West."

Analysis: Just last week, I discussed the growing dissension with the FERC
over the price cap issue (see 3/21 IssueAlert). The dissension appears to be
coming to a head, just as FERC grows from a three-member commission to its
standard five members. As the philosophical complexion of the new FERC is
unknown, it remains questionable whether or not HSbert's adamant stand
against price caps will be sufficient to keep the commission from moving in
this direction. HSbert's hard line against price caps was espoused during the
same week that the FERC chairman appeared at a Santa Fe, N.M. conference and
spoke about high wholesale prices in California and the fact that the state's
utilities could have saved about $5 billion had they accepted proposals for
long-term contracts six months ago.

First, let's look at how the structure of FERC is presently changing and how
this might impact the commission's divided position on price caps. On March
27, President Bush announced his intention to nominate state utility
officials Nora Mead Brownell of Pennsylvania and Patrick Wood III of Texas to
serve on FERC. Word on the nomination of Wood was expected, although rumors
had indicated that Wood might be named to replace HSbert as chairman.
Brownell, a commissioner with the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission,
will be appointed to the remainder of a five-year term that expires June 30
of this year and an additional term expiring in 2006. Wood, who formerly
served on FERC from 1991 to 1993, will be appointed to the remainder of a
five-year term that expires in 2005.

As I mentioned in the 3/21 IssueAlert, the FERC is presently divided on the
issue of price caps. Obviously, HSbert has expressed strong opposition to any
kind of restriction on pricing. However, Commissioner William Massey has said
that he will continue to push for price caps to help calm the volatility of
the California market. Linda Key Breathitt, the third commissioner presently
at FERC, has remained undecided on the issue. What could change the balance
of power at FERC with the two new appointments is the fact that both Brownell
and Wood come from states in which some form of wholesale price caps are
presently in place.

Consequently, there is a real possibility that HSbert, despite his role as
chairman, could soon find himself in the minority position with regard to the
price cap issue. HSbert seems unconcerned about this possibility and has made
reference to "like-minded friends" in Washington who would side with him on
the issue.

The rationale behind HSbert's opposition to price caps has been well
documented. The FERC chairman has not been fully convinced that price caps
would do anything to increase supply or reduce demand in the Western region,
or anywhere else for that matter. Rather, HSbert believes that price caps
have the potential to cause serious damage and actually cause supply to
decrease further as power generators will opt to build plants in other
regions that do not place restrictions on prices.

The fact that HSbert opposes price caps but yet supports FERC's investigation
into the "unjust and unreasonable" prices charged by power suppliers may seem
like somewhat of a contradiction to some observers. Earlier this month, FERC
put 13 California power sellers on notice that they must either make refunds
for certain power sales or provide further justification of their prices.
Total potential refunds or offsets in the ISO and PX markets are
approximately $69 million for January 2001 transactions. Further, FERC
established a price screen of $273/MWh that would be justified during periods
of a Stage 3 alert, and that anything above this price would be considered
excessive. In addition, the commission will determine a top wholesale power
price for each month through April, and then formulate a permanent plan for
monitoring prices in California for transactions taking place after May 1.
FERC is utilizing a methodology to determine the price screen, and scarcity
pricing is a very important factor in the equation. The commission uses a
model that takes different factors into account (for instance, weighted gas,
weighted NOX, etc.) to determine a price of electricity when the lights are
about to go out (Stage 3 alert time). That is the price that FERC uses to
determine scarcity  prices. Therefore, it can and will change month to month.

One may wonder how HSbert can reconcile the use of a market price screen and
yet remain so opposed to price caps. However, it is important to realize
that, for the most part, FERC is not prohibiting that power generators sell
power above the price screen. Rather, FERC will simply demand that any
company selling power above this price report to the commission and justify
the higher-than-average price. That is an important but subtle difference
between a price screen and a price cap, which prohibits generators from
exceeding a certain price.

As noted, HSbert spoke earlier this week at a conference in Santa Fe entitled
"Current Issues Challenging the Utility Industry" sponsored by the Center for
Public Utilities. HSbert spoke about a variety of topics, including the
current status of RTO applications and new technologies related to pipelines
and generation. However, one thing that HSbert said related to the wholesale
market in California struck me as particularly interesting. HSbert said that
last fall wholesale power suppliers offered California utilities long-term
power contracts in the range of $55/MWh. The general consensus among the
utilities and Gov. Gray Davis was that the price was excessive and that they
should wait to sign long-term deals until wholesale prices decreased (or
until the state could negotiate lower prices on behalf of the utilities).
HSbert's point was that California utilities could have saved approximately
$5 billion had they signed on for long-term deals at that time. Most of the
contracts that the California Department of Water Resources is now signing
with power suppliers are confidential and thus we do not know how the fixed
prices of the contracts compare to the average $55/MWh that was offered last
fall. However, most reports indicate that the state of California already has
spent $4 billion to procure power and is expected to pay $14 billion for
power over the course of this year.

Meanwhile, California and other western lawmakers continue to urge the Bush
administration and FERC to enact temporary price caps in the West. In fact,
bipartisan lawmakers from California, Oregon and Washington met with Vice
President Dick Cheney, head of the Bush administration's energy task force,
to assert that soaring electricity prices in the West could lead the entire
country into a recession. Cheney responded that the White House opposes any
price controls on energy as they would discourage new power plants from being
built.

At the Santa Fe conference HSbert said that, "Washington doesn't do temporary
very well." What he meant by this statement was that, although lawmakers are
putting pressure on the federal government to put a temporary price cap into
place, if one were to be enacted it would most likely remain in place for
some time. Clearly, HSbert will continue to oppose wholesale price caps in
the West (unless someone can make the case to him that price restrictions
will lower demand or increase supply). Yet, at the same time, just this week
HSbert said that he was "open" to a request from New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani to enact wholesale power prices in the Northeast. Giuliani asked
FERC to impose a temporary $250/MWh cap on wholesale electricity prices to
ensure that New York City gets through tight summer power supplies without
large price spikes. How FERC as a whole will rule on the larger issue of
price caps across the country (and particularly in California) once the new
commissioners come on board remains to be seen. In any event, FERC (along
with state regulators) still faces the challenge of finding some long-term
solution that will stabilize the market in California and the Pacific
Northwest.

Fuel Guys,

The information that y'all had requested in the meeting does not contain any output or heat balancing information that you will need to assist in the sizing of the lateral.  Jennifer and I provided Fred Mitro information that contained capital cost, property taxes and some other modeling assumptions.  We did not give him any update or indication on where the output and heat rate numbers would be.

I have asked Jennifer to hold off sending you what was requested after today's meeting, because it is omitting the concrete information that you really need.  As soon as we receive new output and heat rate information, I will forward it directly.  If, for some reason, you need capital costs and property tax information, let me know.

Thanks,
Mathew

fyi... editorial in today's LA Daily News:


Lockyer lockdown


Not wanting to be outdone by Gov. Gray Davis, California Attorney General
Bill Lockyer recently tried his hand at Sacramento's new favorite game:
demonizing power generators.
Elaborating on his plan to file criminal charges against energy officials,
Lockyer singled out Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay for imprudent remarks.
"I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell," Lockyer told The
Wall Street Journal, "that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi
my name is Spike, honey."'
Get it?
Spike would proceed to rape, maul and otherwise abuse Lay.
Real funny, isn't it?
Rape is widely considered commonplace in prison, and for good reason. Human
Rights Watch estimates that as many 140,000 inmates have been raped in
penitentiaries nationwide.
In a recent study, the organization documented instances of sexual slavery
taking place in prisons in six different states -- including California.
That should be a serious concern for the state's top law-enforcement official
-- not a laughing matter.
Lockyer might have only been kidding, but his joke contains a tacit admission
that rape is rampant in the state prison system. It suggests that he thinks
this illegal and unconstitutional horror might, on occasion, serve as just
punishment for some.
Perhaps that's why prison officials -- in California and elsewhere -- have
done so little to contain the problem.
But their neglect comes at society's expense. Sexual abuse in American
prisons hardens prisoners and makes them more dangerous upon their release.
Rather than rehabilitating criminals, dangerous prisons reinforce their sense
of lawlessness.
We're willing to write off Lockyer's statement as merely thoughtless and
unfunny, but we doubt that others will be quick to let him off so lightly.
It's hard to imagine that a lawyer representing a raped inmate -- or the
entire class of raped inmates -- would be quite so forgiving.
In a lawsuit against the state corrections system, a quote from the attorney
general making light of rampant sexual violence in state prisons could be
damning.
As the state's top attorney, Lockyer should know better than to serve up
political rhetoric that could open up his clients -- the taxpayers -- to
millions of dollars in legal penalties.
His reckless words and callous attitude do little to inspire public
confidence.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Michael Goldstein called this morning to discuss the way forward in light of
the Rev. Proc. and its recent amendment.  After apologizing for being tardy
in returning my calls, he explained that, in his opinion, the tax advice that
we received evidences a fundamental misunderstanding of the situation.
First, he stated that he has been advised that the Rev. Proc. does not apply
retroactively and that although it requires a new PLR to make changes going
forward, it will have no impact on activities which occurred prior to its
issuance and, therefore, has no impact on whether synfuel created before the
Rev. Proc. qualifies for the tax credit.
He also noted that, to determine the capacity issue, one needs to look at
what could have been produced by the facilities as of the "in- service" date.
This level of capacity is the benchmark for what can be produced. According
to Goldstein, the level of production at Somerset was well below the capacity
on the "in-service" date and, therefore, their proposed modifications to the
facilities would not have increased the capacity in any way inconsistent with
the intent of the Rev. Proc.  When asked what he believed to be the rated
capacity of the facilities on their "in-service" date, Michael didn't know.
He has agreed to find this number and get back to me.
After I explained my understanding of the effect of the Rev. Proc., Michael
kindly suggested that we consider talking to Price Monford (sp?) at VE who he
considers to be one of the inner circle of tax experts familiar with Section
29 and the discussions with the Service and the Treasury Department about
it.  I told him that we had consulted with our own experts and I didn't know
if this fellow was one of them.  He said that he had not talked to Price and
had no idea what he would advise.
Goldstein stated on several occasions that he thought the Rev. Proc. would
serve as a great facilitator to get the parties talking again in order to
mitigate damages.  He stated further that he was actually looking forward to
teeing up the remaining machine at Pier IX and, even, moving the second
machine back to Virginia.  When asked what was happening with the machine at
Pier IX, he indicated that it remains idle because they can't get a source of
coal for it. I told Goldstein that I would visit with the "Coal Guys" about
whether there was a way that we could continue to work together in light of
everything that has happened.  He said that he didn't think this was going to
be a problem since once things were up and running, there wouldn't be much
occasion for the parties to have sufficient contact to yield a problem.  I
suggested that if there was a way forward, we needed to make sure the parties
were on the same page about the Production Test, coal size, etc. and even
suggested a modified dispute resolution process should issues arise during
the course of performance. I think that Sempra is amenable to an trying to
reach an agreement going forward but I expect that absent a mediation or
something extraordinary, we will end up fighting about November through the
date of any deal going forward. Please note that I made clear that I had no
idea whether Enron wanted to have anything to do with Sempra on this deal
outside the courthouse but that I would inquire.  I told him my personal view
was that, no matter how strong we felt our case was, I would always listen to
a settlement plan if they had one.
Finally, I told him I'd get with you guys and call him later today or
tomorrow so that he'd know whether it was worth having any additional
discussions. Please give me call when you get a chance.  It might be a good
idea to set up a call later this afternoon if you are available.

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

ran this structure by him and he is of the same opinion as I that:
Very high rates from 12noon to 6PM do not encourage DSM because:
The risk of installing capital in time for June,July, Aug, Sep is significant
when the timing is short and each month lost decreases the value of the
investment by 1/4
Very high rates from 12noon to 6PM will result in behaviour changes by
changing behaviour more than DSM.  ie.  They will turn up the temperature for
these hours.
Very high rates for 12noon to 6PM encourage curtailment activities but not as
much load shifting.  ie a 2 part rate would encourage doing your annual plant
turnaround in Aug ($250/MWh signal) more than the CPUC proposal for August
($110/MWh signal).
Very high rates starting in June, would be difficult to optimize, given the
lack of certainty today about whether the rates will be pasted and the short
lead time.
The rate design I have proposed below gives large price signals in the summer
and the winter, than those proposed by CPUC, while lessening the impact to
Enron tariff book.
Price Signals Comparison

I have been requested by Javier Chavarria to start direct conversations with Humberto to supply him for the needs of Progasco / Tropigas.  In order to cover our costs and make the sale to Humberto, we need a landed cost around MB + 5 for 55,000 Mts per year delivered in partial cargoes sizes that can vary anywhere from 3,000 Mts to 15,000 Mts but cargoes over 8,000 Mts have to be carefully co-ordinated due to the fact that EcoElctrica keeps an inventory in their tanks.

Suzanne, I need to move aggressively to try and make this deal .

Report: Power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion
DON THOMPSON, Associated Press Writer
Thursday, March 22, 2001
,2001 Associated Press
(03-22) 11:41 PST SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Electricity wholesalers have
overcharged California more than $5 billion since May by manipulating the
energy market, according to a report prepared for power grid managers.
The Independent System Operator will file the findings with federal
regulators and ask for a refund, ISO spokesman Patrick Dorinson said.
The state auditor also said Thursday that the state's 1996 deregulation law
encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to ``manipulate wholesale
prices to their advantage'' by underestimating supply and demand.
The auditor's report lays out what it calls ``a complex combination'' of
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.
According to the ISO report, five in-state power suppliers and 16 importers
frequently offered electricity at prices higher than it cost them to produce
-- effectively withholding supplies -- or didn't bid at all when they were
able to generate power.
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at a
conference in Berkeley last week.
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were
justified.
The commission has recently stepped up scrutiny of power companies' behavior
during California's power crisis, asking suppliers to justify $124 million in
sales during the first two months of the year or refund the money. Critics
claim thousands of additional questionable sales are not being challenged.
California has been spending about $45 million a day -- $4.2 billion since
January -- to purchase power for Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison. Both utilities, the state's largest, have been cut off by
electricity wholesalers because their credit is almost worthless.
Edison and PG&E say they are nearly $14 billion in debt due to soaring
wholesale power costs. The state's deregulation law blocks them from
recovering the costs from customers.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the state's
power-buying is gutting its budget surplus.
Since the state started making emergency power buys, the surplus has fallen
from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she said.
Connell ordered an audit of the power buys, saying Gov. Gray Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She said she would refuse to transfer $5.6 billion into a ``rainy day fund''
she said was set up to impress Wall Street as the state prepares to issue $10
billion in revenue bonds to cover its power buys.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler, of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
``The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to
demand that kind of audit information,'' Harrison said.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the administration has released the
financial information it can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term
power contracts with wholesalers.
Also Wednesday, a federal judge ordered a major wholesaler, Reliant Energy
Services, to continue selling power to California despite its fear that it
will not be paid.
The ISO buys power from companies like Reliant on behalf of utilities in
attempts to fend off rolling blackouts like those that hit the state this
week and during two days in January.

Reliant To Appeal Fed Judge Ruling To Sell Pwr To Calif

03/22/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- Reliant Energy Inc. (REI) said Thursday it will
immediately file with the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco in
response to a federal judge's ruling late Wednesday that the company continue
selling power to California regardless of whether it is paid.
U.S. District Court Judge Frank Damrell granted California's Independent
System Operator, which makes last minute power purchases in the spot market,
a preliminary injunction against Reliant, saying Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the state.
The ISO, manager of the state's electricity grid, said the judge's ruling
will allow the agency to keep the lights on in California.
Reliant, which is owed more than $300 million from the state's cash-strapped
utilities, supplies California with about 3,000 megawatts of electricity from
power plants it owns in the state.
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley said the state Department of Water
Resources, the agency that buys California's bulk power needs on behalf of
PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit
Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas &
Electric, should back the ISO's last minute power purchases.
In a filing with the Securities and Commission, Reliant said it is owed $108
million by the DWR for last minute power purchases the ISO made during the
six weeks prior to the agreement Reliant made with the DWR.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's claim, saying he does not have the authority to
force the DWR to pay for that power.
"We're going to immediately appeal Judge Damrell's order," Wheatley said.
"Clearly the judge understands the implications of his order. We are required
to do business with creditworthy entities. Unfortuantely the judge did not
force the ISO to post a surety bond, which would allowed us to do business
with the ISO."
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state is not responsible for the last minute
power purchases the ISO makes, despite a law passed authorizing the DWR to
buy power on behalf of the utilities.
Wheatley added that the company will also seek relief on the issue at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Damrell's ruling remains in effect
until the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
Separately, Wheatley said a short-term power supply contract that Reliant
signed with the DWR expired Monday and the DWR has not renewed the contract.
A spokesman for the DWR would not comment on the issue.

Federal judge orders major power wholesaler to sell to California

Updated: March 21, 2001 - 8:23 p.m.
A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering a major
electricity wholesaler to continue selling to California despite its fear
that it will not get paid.
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the
Independent System Operator, which oversees the state's power grid. The ISO
buys last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill gaps in supply to try
to fend off blackouts.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.
The state has been spending about $50 million a day on power for Pacific Gas
and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison, both denied credit by
suppliers after amassing billions of dollars in debts.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the
costly last-minute power ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said.
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
Damrell denied the ISO's request for preliminary injunctions against three
other wholesalers, Dynegy, AES and Williams, who agreed to continue selling
to the ISO pending the FERC ruling.
Spokesmen for Reliant, Dynegy, AES and Williams were out of the office
Wednesday night and didn't immediately return calls from The Associated Press
seeking comment on the ruling.
The ISO went to court in February after a federal emergency order requiring
the power sales expired. The judge then issued a temporary restraining order,
requiring the sales, but dropped it after the suppliers agreed to continue
sales to California, pending his Wednesday ruling.
The ISO said it would lose about 3,600 megawatts if the suppliers pulled out,
enough power for about 2.7 million households. One megawatt is enough for
roughly 750 homes.
Grid officials said Reliant's share alone is about 3,000 megawatts. Reliant
said the amount at issue actually is less than a fourth of that, because most
of the power is committed under long-term contracts.
Reliant, which provides about 9 percent of the state's power, worries it
won't get paid due to the financial troubles of PG&E and Edison.
PG&E and Edison say that together they have lost about $13 billion since June
due to soaring wholesale electricity costs that California's 1996
deregulation law bars them from passing onto customers.
At the same time, the state has faced a tight electricity supply, due in part
to California power plant shutdowns for maintenance and to a tight
hydroelectric supply in the Pacific Northwest.
Managers of the state power grid imposed rolling blackouts across the state
Monday and Tuesday as supply fell short of demand. Wednesday, cooling
temperatures and the completion of repairs at several power plants allowed
the state to avoid blackouts.
State Controller Kathleen Connell said Wednesday that the energy crunch also
imperils California's financial health.
Connell said the state's power-buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is is
gutting its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power
buys in January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2
billion, she said.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power-buying, saying Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She is refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its
power-buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.
"The law says she has to do it. The law does not give her the power to demand
that kind of audit information," Harrison said.
He said the state's budget isn't in danger because it will be repaid with the
$10 billion in long-term debt.
Wells Fargo & Co. chief economist Sung Won Sohn said he sees little progress
in efforts to fix the state's power problems and end state electricity
purchases.
"If we're going to pour money into a bottomless pit, I would worry about the
state's finances," he said. "At some point we're going to run out of money."
The controller's criticism of fellow Democrat Davis won support from Assembly
Republicans and Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican considering
challenging Davis next year.
Jones said he wants to announce his own plan to solve the state's energy
woes, but can't unless Davis releases more financial details.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Maviglio said the administration has released the financial information it
can without jeopardizing negotiations for long-term power contracts with
wholesalers.
Also Wednesday, a report by Davis' chief power negotiator appears to show
that as much as 75 percent of the state's power purchases will have to be on
the expensive short-term market this summer, said Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina
del Rey, chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee.
"The prices may be phenomenol," she said, particularly given predicted
hydroelectric shortages due to drought in the Pacific Northwest.
The report by David Freeman, who is negotiating the state's long-term power
contracts, shows California has finalized 19 contracts and has 25 agreements
in principle. Freeman said DWR is continuing to negotiate other contracts.
Bowen said FERC should impose short-term price caps or let generators to
charge enough to make a reasonable profit "or we could be subject to enormous
price-gouging this summer."

State falling short on pacts that provide low-cost energy
Published Thursday, March 22, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News
BY CHRIS O'BRIEN AND JOHN WOOLFOLK

Mercury News

The state has signed low-cost contracts for just a third of the energy it
needs this year, raising the prospect that California could be forced to buy
much of its electricity this summer on the expensive spot market.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis conceded Wednesday that the state will be in
trouble without more contracts, but insisted California will meet its needs
through conservation and additional long-term deals for cheap electricity.
The state, according to a report released Wednesday, has fallen far short of
the governor's goal of filling almost all its electricity needs through such
deals. In fact, the state has lined up contracts for about half the amount
Davis had projected earlier this month.
If the state has to rely heavily on the volatile spot market, where the price
of electricity this summer could reach five times the state's contract price,
pressure could mount to raise the cap on the electricity rates consumers pay.
But Steven Maviglio, the governor's spokesman, said, ``The governor has said
he's committed to work this in the existing rate structure, so that's the
plan.''
In the report sent to state lawmakers, the state Department of Water
Resources indicated that it had secured just more than 20 million
megawatt-hours for this year, leaving it far short of the 60 million
megawatt-hours needed.
``This is just a progress report,'' Maviglio said. ``They did all this in
three weeks, which is pretty amazing when you think about it, and we have a
lot more to do.''
The state got into the power buying business in January, supplying it to the
state's nearly bankrupt utilities.
The state negotiated long-term contracts with generators to supply that power
at a reduced rate. Based on the report, the state will pay an average of $68
per megawatt-hour over the next 10 years -- significantly less than in
December when prices spiked higher than $300 per megawatt-hour but not as low
as the $55 Davis hoped to reach.
Most of this power, however, won't be delivered until 2004. From 2004 to
2006, the Department of Water Resources estimates, it has enough power under
contract. Until then, the amount falls short.
In 2001, it appears the state has about one-third of the power it needs. The
gap closes to about half in 2002 and two-thirds in 2003.
At a news conference in Los Angeles two weeks ago, Davis said the state would
have to buy only 30 to 45 percent of the power it needs this summer on the
open market.
At the time, critics said with only two-thirds of the power under contract, a
rate increase was almost inevitable. Even Davis' chief negotiator, S. David
Freeman, offered a bleak assessment for the summer, saying that all available
electricity has already been sold.
``We'll be subject to extremely high prices,'' said Frank Wolak, a Stanford
professor who sits on a market committee for the Independent System Operator,
the agency that runs the state power grid.
Wolak said there are two main hopes for avoiding a price increase this
summer: Federal officials could cap the wholesale price, a step they've
resisted, or Californians can conserve an unprecedented amount of power.

Crisis saps state surplus
POWER CRISIS
Controller moves to block a transfer of funds, saying the $8.5 billion
surplus has been cut more than half since January
By Mike Taugher
TIMES STAFF WRITER
The energy crisis has bled California's once-touted budget surplus by more
than half since taxpayers began buying electricity two months ago, leading a
top state finance official Wednesday to order an audit of the power purchases
and block Gov. Gray Davis' plan to transfer funds into a reserve account.
A booming economy last year produced a budget surplus that totaled $8.5
billion in January. But that figure now stands at about $3.2 billion,
according to Controller Kathleen Connell.
"We started this year with a generous budget surplus," Connell said in a
statement announcing her decision to block what Davis administration
officials described as a routine transfer of surplus money. "The energy
crisis has taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the
electricity purchases would put the fund at risk."
Meanwhile, the Davis administration released a report by David Freeman, the
governor's chief negotiator on power purchases, on the progress of executing
long-term agreements meant to stabilize the power buys.
According to the report, only about 40 percent of the electricity needed from
the open market this year has been lined up. That means the state could be
forced to continue buying a substantial amount of power on the highly
expensive spot market and further drain its coffers.
And a key regulatory panel is scheduled next week to issue a ruling that
would determine how quickly state funds will be replenished when it decides
what portion of electric bill payments should be allocated to the state
treasury, a decision that could include a rate increase to fully repay
taxpayers without further crippling the state's two largest electric
utilities.
The Public Utilities Commission also will consider whether it will force the
utilities to pay alternative energy producers, whose shutdowns this week
contributed to blackouts.
Connell's action underscores a growing nervousness over the sheer volume of
money that is being poured into energy buys, despite the fact that state
officials plan to replenish the treasury with up to $10 billion in loans that
will be repaid by electricity consumers.
The state has committed to spending $4.2 billion to date to keep lights on
since taxpayers were forced in mid-January to take over electricity buys from
the financially crippled utilities, Pacific Gas & Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison. Tax money is going out at a clip of about $50 million a
day.
High prices already have brought PG&E and Edison to the brink of bankruptcy,
and now the state's surplus is at risk, according to Connell.
In addition to requesting an audit and announcing her intention to delay the
transfer to the reserve account, Connell said she wanted the administration
to send her office more information about the electricity purchases.
Davis' representatives questioned Connell's authority in trying to block the
funds transfer, which they called a routine accounting procedure, and accused
her of making political hay.
"It is not helpful to the taxpayers or ratepayers or the people who just want
to keep the lights on, it isn't helpful to have the situation muddied like
this," said Sandy Harrison, a Finance Department spokesperson. "We're sorry
it came up in this manner."
Connell and the administration have butted heads in recent weeks. The
controller wants to post details of the state's electricity purchases on her
Web site, a plan that have been delayed under pressure from Davis because of
the governor's concerns that releasing those details will allow power
generators and traders to sell at higher prices.
Harrison said administration officials believe Connell lacks the authority
either to block the funds transfer to a reserve account or to audit the state
water resources department.
Two days of widespread blackouts this week show how vulnerable the power grid
is to financial glitches. Although several factors combined to produce the
blackouts, state power officials say the outages could have been avoided if
the utilities were paying their bills to alternative energy producers.
Many of those producers, including clean-burning natural gas power plants,
wind, solar and geothermal energy developers, shut down enough production to
spell the difference between grid reliability and blackouts Monday and
Tuesday.
Davis called the utilities' failure to pay bills to those producers, known as
qualifying facilities, "immoral." The QFs were either unable to buy gas from
their suppliers or were frustrated with the utilities' failure to pay them.
"The utilities hoarded billions of dollars since November without paying any
money out," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "They've got the money --
we're pulling the trigger to make them pay it."
The utilities, however, say they are doing all they can to conserve enough
cash to continue operating. Together, they owe the QFs about $1.5 billion.
Next week, the PUC is scheduled to consider whether to force the utilities to
heed Davis' demand to pay the QFs, and it might also decide how much of
ratepayers' bill payments will be used to refund taxpayers for power buys.
PG&E says that under a formula proposed by the administration, the water
resources department would receive about 40 percent of the money collected
from ratepayers for power purchases.
The rest of that money, about $240 million, would have to be divided among
QFs, existing power contracts, operating PG&E's nuclear and hydroelectric
plants, and what hour-by-hour purchases the utility still must make on the
spot market, according to PG&E spokesman John Nelson.
"There isn't enough to do that," he said.
That is making it increasingly likely that electric bills will be hiked,
according to a growing chorus of officials and experts.
Unless rates are raised, Nelson said, the only entity that can absorb a lack
of payment or a partial payment is the state treasury. Cutting off any others
will lead to electricity becoming unavailable and more blackouts, he said.
"If they do it under existing rates -- given that the existing pool of money
is not enough -- who doesn't get paid or who gets a partial payment?" Nelson
said. "What's the only entity left with wiggle room? The state."
Rate hikes are also a sticking point in negotiations to bail out the
utilities through purchase of their transmission lines and other assets,
Maviglio said.
"They want rate increases of significant magnitude, and we're not going
there," he said.
WE CAN TRIM STORY HERE IF NECESSARY, BUT KEEP TAGLINES AT BOTTOM
About one-third the electricity needed by the customers of California's three
major utility companies is produced by the companies themselves, one-third
comes from alternative producers who use environmentally friendly techniques
and one-third is bought on the open market.
The state stepped in to buy the one-third needed from the open market after
the utility companies ran out of cash and credit in January to make the
purchases themselves.
But that electricity has proven to be enormously expensive, and Davis has
planned to lower those prices by committing to long-term purchases.
Freeman's report on the progress of those long-term purchases, dated March 15
but released this week, said the state has finalized 19 contracts with seven
suppliers and reached 25 additional agreements.

Bill to pay small energy firms stalls
By Kevin Yamamura, Dale Kasler and Jim Sanders
Bee Staff Writers
(Published March 23, 2001)
A quickly melded proposal that would assure payments for alternative energy
suppliers whose money woes contributed to power blackouts this week stalled
Thursday in a divided Legislature.
The state Senate passed the bill, AB 8x, but with Republicans balking, it was
rejected in the Assembly along party lines. Assembly leaders said they may
try again today.
For most of Thursday, lawmakers scrutinized legislation they had overhauled
the night before to include Gov. Gray Davis' plan to force utilities to pay
solar, wind and small gas-fired suppliers. Such providers, called "qualified
facilities," or QFs, provide more than 20 percent of California's
electricity, and their shutdowns were partly to blame for rolling blackouts
Monday and Tuesday.
Under the Democratic governor's plan, the state Public Utilities Commission
would determine prices at which alternative generators may sell power, but
legislation is needed to authorize the PUC action.
Lawmakers faced time pressures Thursday. They wanted to pass the bill quickly
so the PUC could act next week and legislators could embark Monday on an
annual three-day lobbying trip in Washington, D.C.
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks, said the Republicans'
rejection of AB 8x could jeopardize more than $4 billion the state has spent
or allocated for electricity during the energy crisis.
Hertzberg said producers of alternative energy, which are owed more than $1
billion, have threatened to drag debt-ridden utilities into involuntary
bankruptcy if the Legislature failed to pass the measure.
"They said it, and I believe it," Hertzberg said. If such bankruptcies occur,
he added, the state with its multibillion-dollar debt would become "just
another creditor in a pile of creditors."
But Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell of Villa Park said the
finger-pointing is unfair. Passage of AB 8x would not necessarily prevent
bankruptcies, he said.
One alternative energy provider won a crucial court ruling Thursday that
staved off, at least for a while, threats by some creditors to haul one or
both big utilities into bankruptcy court for nonpayment of bills.
CalEnergy Co. Inc. won the right to sell its geothermal power, which was
contracted to Southern California Edison, on the open market. CalEnergy said
it is owed $45 million by Edison.
If the Imperial County judge hadn't ruled in CalEnergy's favor, the company
and seven other QFs "were fully prepared" to file an involuntary bankruptcy
petition against Edison this morning, said David Sokol, chief executive of
CalEnergy's parent, MidAmerican Energy Holdings Co. of Des Moines, Iowa.
"That is currently off the table."
An involuntary bankruptcy proceeding would take California's energy crisis
into uncharted territory, although a bankruptcy judge would have the leeway
to reject the filing.
Freed from its contract with Edison, CalEnergy will move to sell its
electricity "to people who will pay for it," Sokol said.
Besides calming the bankruptcy movement temporarily, the ruling also could
prompt other alternative energy providers -- hundreds of which have shut down
because of nonpayment by Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. -- to follow
CalEnergy's example and find other buyers for their electricity, said Gary
Ackerman of the Western Power Trading Forum, an association of generators.
Assembly Republicans said they felt the Senate's decision to package three
important energy issues into a single bill was an attempt to ramrod
legislation through both houses.
"We have to stand and say no," Campbell said during floor debate.
Besides determining alternative generator payments, the bill would change an
earlier law by capping the value of bonds the state may sell for power
purchases at $10 billion. It also would extend to large businesses an
existing rate cap in the San Diego Gas and Electric Co. service area.
And it would earmark a portion of rates paid by utility customers to fund the
state's ongoing power purchases. Within a week, the state will have spent
$4.2 billion on power since January.
Without the bill, some legislators fear, Pacific Gas and Electric and
Southern California Edison would be reimbursed before the state.
"They have got (some) gall to go to the PUC and say they're going to go to
court to keep our money -- to keep our money to pay off their creditors,"
said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco.
Most of the bill's controversy, however, centered on how the PUC would treat
gas-fired alternative generators.
The commission issued a revised draft decision Wednesday that would impose
prices for qualifying facilities at $79 a megawatt-hour for five-year
contracts or $69 a megawatt-hour for 10 years.
But those producers that use natural gas -- representing about two-thirds of
the alternative energy providers in California -- spent Thursday arguing that
Davis' plan to rescue them would all but guarantee that they would go out of
business instead.
The plan -- ordering Edison and PG&E to pay them a fixed price for their
power -- would set rates well below the cost of natural gas, they said.
Democratic lawmakers tried to assure such producers that the PUC would set
prices that make business sense, even obtaining a letter to that effect from
Loretta Lynch, who heads the commission.
Davis has vowed to fine Edison and PG&E if they don't pay alternative
producers for future deliveries. But Sokol said his company isn't convinced
that Edison will pay.
Calling Edison a "confrontive, in-your-face, nasty organization," Sokol said
the utility was "sitting on $2 billion" and not paying its bills. Edison, in
a Securities and Exchange Commission filing Thursday, said its debts outweigh
its cash reserves by $722 million.
The Senate sent the Assembly two other bills that deal specifically with
supply and demand. The first, SB 5x, would spend about $1 billion on energy
conservation and low-income assistance programs. The other, SB 28x, would
streamline siting procedures for power plant construction.
In separate energy-related matters Thursday, the Assembly approved:
AB 21x, which would allow businesses, industries or other electrical
customers to negotiate private contracts with energy providers.
Nine energy bills designed to generate or save 665 megawatts of electricity
-- including 345 megawatts this summer. One megawatt is enough electricity to
light about 1,000 homes.
The state put power emergencies behind it, after dropping out of a Stage 1
alert late Wednesday. The California Independent System Operator, which
manages the state's power transmission grid, was predicting no further alerts
this week. It expected cooling temperatures and a regular dropoff in
electricity use on Fridays to lessen demand, at the same time that more power
plants were returning to service.

House panel ends energy hearings -- will it step in?
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published March 23, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- A key House panel wrapped up a series of hearings on the
California electricity crisis Thursday and now will decide whether to come to
the state's aid with legislation.
But the panel's Texas chairman made clear that West Coast price controls
won't be on the table.
"Caps will not be in anything I am submitting," said Rep. Joe Barton,
chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee's energy and air quality
subcommittee.
Some form of federal controls to hold down escalating wholesale prices this
summer because of power shortages has been the most frequent appeal of
witnesses who testified before the panel during roughly 30 hours of hearings
over five days.
Such controls have been sought by the governors of California, Oregon and
Washington. As power shortages are forecast for other regions, states like
New York also have appealed for temporary price controls to halt gouging.
But the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is responsible for
enforcing reasonable wholesale rates under the Federal Power Act, has refused
to impose them, and the Bush administration is bolstering that decision by
opposing any legislation that would compel such action.
Barton, in a brief hallway interview, declined to say what other legislative
remedies he might propose to address the worsening California situation.
He said he expects to submit a list of ideas to the White House today, and
after receiving comment on it, sit down with other committee Republicans and
Democrats next week to see if any legislation is in order.
"If we are going to do anything to help California or the West this summer,
we have to make it law within the next month or six weeks," Barton said.
Even the panel's senior Democrat, Virginia Rep. Rick Boucher, was urging a
"careful and deliberate approach" to the California crisis, which he said was
largely of the state's own making.
There are steps Congress might take to provide some help to the West, such as
more money for conservation and relaxed federal regulation of air quality
standards. That would permit older, more polluting generators to operate
through a long, hot summer when electricity demand could exceed supply by
about 3,000 megawatts, roughly the amount needed to power 3 million homes.
But Alan Lloyd, chairman of the California Air Resources Board, said power
production already is being maximized without sacrificing air quality.
"Simply put, no essential electricity generation has been curtailed due to
air emission limitations," he said. "California's programs to protect public
health are not major factors in the electricity shortages experienced to
date."
The concern is that as shortages turn into more rolling blackouts, wholesale
prices will jump even higher and steadily bleed the economies of California
and the West Coast.
William L. Massey, the lone member of the energy regulatory commission who
supports price controls, said at a Tuesday hearing that without them the West
Coast faces economic catastrophe this summer.
It was evident from the comments of some Republicans that they think their
party could capitalize politically from a difficult summer.
"If they had a bad summer, it could show up in the polls," said Rep. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga. "And sometimes that's not a bad idea."
One of the most dramatic exchanges during the weeklong hearings came Thursday
with S. David Freeman, the former general manager of the Sacramento Municipal
Utility District who now heads the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
He recently was named Gov. Gray Davis' chief negotiator with power generators
for long-term contracts to stabilize future deliveries.
"Don't feel sorry for California," Freeman said. "We're going to come out of
this stronger than ever."
But Freeman said it will be a year or two before all the fixes are in place,
and in the meantime the region desperately needs Congress' help to force the
FERC into controlling wholesale prices, which witnesses said are likely to
rise from $7 billion last year to as much as $70 billion or more this year.
"We recognize that the current administration and various legislators have
their own opinion as to the California situation," Freeman said. "But my
personal plea is that if the federal government is not going to help us, the
least it should do is refrain from legislation that attempts to tell us what
to do."
Barton perked up at that idea.
"Leave California alone, huh?" Barton said. "That might be a good motto."

Dan Walters: Crisis deepens: politicos panic


(Published March 23, 2001)
That choking sound you hear is California's political class shifting into
near-panic mode as it realizes that the energy crisis is on the verge of
becoming a full-scale meltdown, with utilities forced into bankruptcy and
consumers hammered by severe and prolonged power blackouts and soaring
electricity bills.
The Legislature, which had been content to allow Gov. Gray Davis to handle
the crisis on his own, suddenly came to life Thursday, jolted by this week's
unexpected rolling blackouts and threats by creditors to force the utilities
into bankruptcy court. Lawmakers quickly fashioned a basketful of legislation
aimed -- or so they hope -- at increasing power supplies, promoting
conservation and relieving the financial pressure on utilities and
electricity generators. But it may be too little, too late -- and Davis and
other politicians are already pointing fingers of blame, aware that a
political price will be paid if the apocalypse strikes.
While Davis chants his mantra that he inherited a fatally flawed utility
deregulation scheme from predecessor Pete Wilson, Republicans are blaming
Davis for moving too slowly after the crisis first surfaced last summer, and
even some of Davis' fellow Democrats are distancing themselves from the
governor.
"Deregulation was a product of a Republican governor, a Republican author and
a Republican PUC (Public Utilities Commission) that was unduly impatient,"
Davis said at one point this week as the Capitol buzzed with private
negotiations and public posturing.
A day later, however, state Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, issued a
warning that Davis' power purchases, running at $50 million a day, had
already drawn down state budget reserves by nearly two-thirds, and she
refused to authorize additional transfers. It was a direct shot by Connell at
Davis, an old rival, and came just a day after the governor had endorsed a
Connell foe, Antonio Villaraigosa, in the duel for mayor of Los Angeles.
Other Democrats didn't join Connell's direct challenge to Davis, but there
is, nevertheless, a growing concern among Democratic legislators that the
power purchases are costing many billions of dollars more than the governor
had projected and could place the state budget in jeopardy. They're nervous
because Davis has refused to reveal, even to legislators, exactly how much
power the state is buying each day and how much it is paying.
From the few details that have been disclosed, it's clear that the state is
spending about $1.5 billion a month, which would wipe out the state's
reserves by midsummer. It's also becoming increasingly clear that Davis
probably can't make good on his promise to avoid major consumer rate
increases, unless the state is willing to plunge deeply and semi-permanently
into debt to underwrite wholesale costs, or unless federal authorities order
huge refunds from power suppliers.
Rates in areas served by private utilities have risen only slightly while the
costs, first to utilities and later to the state, soared. Data from the
administration and utilities, when collated, indicate that the state is in
line to collect just 20 cents for every dollar it's spending on power
purchases, and the gap will increase as summer heat drives up demand.
Privately, some economists say that private utility rates will have to rise
33 percent to 50 percent to cover costs of current power supplies, plus
utilities' past debts to generators and the state's purchase of the
utilities' transmission system, if that deal is made final.
"It's ultimately going to break down, and the ratepayer is going to pay for
it one way or the other," Republican Sen. Jim Battin said during one of
Thursday's many committee hearings on utility legislation. No one disagreed
with him.

Report says power wholesalers overcharged state $6 billion



By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Electricity wholesalers have overcharged California more than
$6.2 billion by manipulating the energy market, according to a report by an
economist working for power grid managers.
The Independent System Operator planned to file the findings with federal
regulators Thursday, and ask for a refund, said ISO spokesman Patrick
Dorinson.
In a related development, the state auditor said Thursday that the state's
1996 deregulation law encouraged both buyers and sellers of electricity to
"manipulate wholesale prices to their advantage" by underestimating both
supply and demand.

The auditor's report lays out what it calls "a complex combination" of
deficiencies and misjudgments it says led to the state's power problems.
The ISO's filing came a day after the state controller complained that a
relentless energy crisis is jeopardizing California's financial future.
Since May, the companies manipulated the market by bidding at excessive
prices, effectively withholding supplies or by not bidding at all when they
had generation capability available, according to the ISO study.
ISO Director of Market Analysis Anjali Sheffrin presented the findings at an
energy conference at the University of California, Berkeley, last week.
The companies have denied overcharging California and have said they expect
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will determine their prices were
justified.
In a burst of activity after weeks of delay, both houses of the Legislature
approved bills Thursday designed to ease the energy crisis.
The state Senate approved measures to encourage energy conservation and speed
up power plant construction.
Topping that, the Assembly sent the Senate 14 energy-related bills, including
$455 million in loans and grants to encourage energy efficiency and
conservation and alternative energy projects by this summer.
One of the Assembly bills would require new energy plants approved by the
state to sell their power within California before they offer it to other
states.
"The (California) Energy Commission says for every day we delay this bill
there are 20 megawatts that could be saved that we're not saving," said state
Sen. Byron Sher, D-Stanford, as senators voted 28-10 to send his conservation
measure to the Assembly.
Senators also approved another Sher bill speeding up the siting of power
plants. It went to the Assembly on a 37-1 vote.
Meanwhile, a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction Wednesday ordering
one of the companies named in the ISO filing, Reliant Energy Services, to
continue selling to California despite its fear that it will not be paid.
U.S. District Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of
irreparable harm if Reliant stopped selling power to the ISO, which buys at
the last minute on behalf of utilities to bolster supplies and try to fend
off blackouts.
Such blackouts struck the state twice this week, shutting off power to
hundreds of thousands of people from San Diego to Oregon, snarling traffic
and shutting down businesses.
The state remained free of any power alerts Thursday morning, as power
reserves stayed above 7 percent.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities,
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for that power.
The utilities have been denied credit after amassing billions of dollars in
debt paying high prices for power that the state's energy deregulation law
prevents them from passing on to consumers.
Gov. Gray Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the
costly last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law
authorizing state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
ISO attorney Charles Robinson said the ruling gives ISO operators "a tool to
assist them in keeping the lights on in California."
"Had the decision gone the other way, one could expect other generators to
simply ignore emergency orders," Robinson said.
Damrell's preliminary injunction will remain in effect until the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission rules on the matter.
In another development Wednesday, state Controller Kathleen Connell
complained that the energy crunch is imperiling California's financial
health.
Connell said the state's power buying on behalf of Edison and PG&E is gutting
its budget surplus. Since the state started making emergency power buys in
January, the surplus has fallen from $8.5 billion to about $3.2 billion, she
said.
Connell ordered an audit of the state's power buying, saying Davis is
withholding key financial information from her office and the Legislature.
She is also refusing a request by Davis and the Legislature to transfer $5.6
billion into a "rainy day fund" she said was set up to impress Wall Street as
the state prepares to issue $10 billion in revenue bonds to cover its power
buying.
Transferring the money would leave the state general fund $2.4 billion in
debt, Connell said.
Sandy Harrison, spokesman for the state Department of Finance, and Keely
Bosler of the Legislative Analyst's Office, said such transfers are routine
and required by law.
They put the state's budget surplus at $5.6 billion.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed the criticism.
"Political grandstanding doesn't generate one more kilowatt of energy for
California in this time of emergency," he said.
Connell is a candidate for mayor of Los Angeles in next month's election.
The ISO study, meanwhile, covered five major in-state power suppliers )
Reliant, Dynegy, Williams/AES, Duke Energy and Mirant, as well as 16 power
importers. All deliver power to customers of Edison, PG&E and San Diego Gas &
Electric Co., the state's three largest investor-owned utilities.
"All overcharged, but some excessively and some by moderate amounts," said
ISO's Sheffrin.
According to the report, the overcharging took place beginning last May, when
the energy crisis began, and continued through last month.
During that time, according to the report, energy suppliers commonly offered
their electricity at twice the amount it cost them to produce.
FERC member William L. Massey said he wasn't shocked to hear the amount
overcharged added up to more than $5 billion.
"Prices over the past 10 months in California have greatly exceeded the
federal standards of just and reasonable prices, and I think they have
exceeded the standards by possibly billions of dollars," he said.
Chuck Griffin, spokesman for Atlanta-based Mirant said the company would
justify their charges to FERC officials.
"I think we're missing sometimes just how basic the problem is in California.
Supply and demand are out of whack and some basic rules of economics kick in
when that happens," he said.

Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm



Controller puts hold on transfer of $5.6 billion to reserve funds
By Karen Kucher and Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS
March 22, 2001
The state's general fund surplus has dropped to $3.2 billion from $8.5
billion since January largely because California's power purchases are
devouring the money, state controller Kathleen Connell said yesterday.
Connell said she wants to see more documentation about state power spending
before approving the transfer of $5.6 billion from the general fund to a
special reserve fund requested by Gov. Gray Davis.
Connell said the state would have to borrow $2.4 billion to cover the
transfer.

"We started this year with a generous budget surplus. The energy crisis has
taken much of that away, and this transfer on top of the electricity
purchases would put the (general) fund at risk," Connell said in a statement.
Her action came on a day when state power supplies improved. After two days
of forced outages this week, no rolling blackouts were ordered yesterday.
Several power plants came back on line and imports from the Pacific Northwest
provided enough electricity to meet demand yesterday, said Stephanie
McCorkle, a spokeswoman with the California Independent System Operator,
which manages most of the state's power grid.
"Gradually more (electricity) generation comes on every day," McCorkle said.
"By Monday, we should see somewhere around 2,200 megawatts back in service
that was not on this Monday. That's if no other generation falls off."
Meanwhile, Connell's move took some by surprise.
A spokesman for the state Department of Finance said Connell is denying a
routine transfer that is required by law. "It was just a routine accounting
measure that we didn't anticipate becoming controversial," Sandy Harrison
said.
Connell announced the denial of the transfer a day after Davis endorsed one
of her opponents, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, in the race
for Los Angeles mayor.
Connell, who monitors California's cash flow, said she was "deeply concerned
about putting the state's general fund in a deficit situation in light of the
energy crisis."
About two months ago, the state began spending about $50 million a day to buy
power after Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern California Edison nearly
went bankrupt. It is also purchasing power for customers of San Diego Gas and
Electric.
The Davis administration said earlier this week it soon will begin spending
an additional $500 million on power purchases, bringing the total to $4.2
billion.
As that staggering sum continues to grow, the state won a court battle with
an electricity supplier yesterday. A federal judge in Sacramento sided with
the state and ordered the wholesaler to continue selling to California
despite its fear that it will not get paid.
Judge Frank C. Damrell Jr. said Californians were at risk of irreparable harm
if Reliant Energy Services stopped selling power to the Independent System
Operator. The ISO acquires last-minute power on behalf of utilities to fill
gaps in supply to try to fend off blackouts.
Damrell dismissed Reliant's attempt to force the state Department of Water
Resources to back the ISO's purchases for the state's two biggest utilities.
The judge said he had no authority to force the DWR to pay for the power.
Davis has said the state isn't responsible for purchasing the costly
last-minute power the ISO buys for Edison and PG&E, despite a law authorizing
state power purchases on the utilities' behalf.
Meanwhile, those who manage the power grid say the forecast for power
supplies this week looks good, although conditions can change quickly.
ISO managers continue to stress the importance of conservation. Utility
customers across the state conserved about 900 megawatts of power Tuesday,
which kept blackouts from being ordered that night.
As the power crisis worsened this week, ISO managers wished aloud that they
still could rely on business customers to shut down in exchange for lower
energy rates.
Such "interruptible" customers saved as much as 2,100 megawatts last spring,
a figure that dropped to about 1,700 last summer and 1,400 at the end of the
year. But in January, the state Public Utilities Commission told utilities
they could no longer impose fines on business customers who refuse to shut
down when asked.
ISO managers realize the program was harming businesses with frequent
interruptions of service -- but they still miss having that option, McCorkle
said.
"It would have made an enormous difference, but at the same time we
understand the impact it was having on businesses," McCorkle said.

Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say



By Dean Calbreath
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
March 22, 2001
Until this week, the San Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce was predicting
that the county was well-insulated from the growing threat of economic
recession.
But that was before the lights went out in the chamber's downtown
headquarters Monday.
Working by window light in his darkened office, chamber economist Kelly
Cunningham rapidly erased his previous projections for 3.5 percent growth for
San Diego County. Cunningham now feels the local economy could fall into a
recession thanks to its shaky supply of energy.

"Blackouts are very disruptive to the economy," Cunningham said. "A business
can absorb rising energy prices by cutting costs or raising its own prices.
But an energy shutoff is much less predictable. It cuts into productivity."
Those sentiments are being echoed throughout California, as business leaders
and economists worry that rolling blackouts will darken the state's
previously glowing economy.
At the University of California Los Angeles, for instance, leading financial
theorists will meet April 4 to discuss the question "Can California grow in
the dark?" Although the topic was chosen before the recent string of power
outages, the blackouts have given the issue new urgency.
"These blackouts are not just a single episode," said UCLA economist Tom
Lieser. "They are a bridge to what will happen this summer. If we don't fall
into a recession in the second half of the year, we will fall pretty close."
Tapan Munroe, an economist formerly with Pacific Gas and Electric, this week
crossed out his projection for 2 percent statewide growth. After blackouts
rolled toward his consulting offices in the Bay Area city of Moraga, Munroe
decided the state will be lucky if it manages zero growth.
"I'm a pretty optimistic guy by nature, but this has been sobering," Munroe
said. "On Tuesday, one restaurant alone in San Francisco lost $20,000.
Multiply that by all of the businesses that lost power in the state and
you've got a serious problem."
Two days of blackouts in San Diego County have hurt businesses large and
small. Among the industries under threat is the local biotechnology sector,
which requires a steady supply of electricity to power areas of laboratories
that must remain temperature-controlled and sterile.
Continued blackouts "could have a huge impact, not only in dollars, but
multiple millions of dollars," said Tom Oster, vice president of operations
for BioCom, the leading trade organization for the more than 200 biotechs in
San Diego County.
Idun Pharmaceuticals, a biotech near La Jolla Village Drive that has 67
employees, had its power cut for about 40 minutes Tuesday. Though the company
has a back-up generator, some segments of its laboratories and lab equipment
were not supported by it. Chemists also had to turn off some sensitive lab
equipment to avoid the possibility of a damaging power surge once the
blackout was over.
"We're not in a position as a small company to back up the whole facility,"
said Steven Mento, Idun's chief executive. "We haven't done a survey yet to
determine whether we had losses, either in experiments or equipment damaged
-- but we're hoping because the blackout was so short that damage will be
minimal."
Mento said rolling blackouts, coupled with continuing high energy costs,
could cripple many small biotechs -- and even take a bite out of bigger, more
established companies.
"We generate new compounds in controlled environments on a daily basis, and
when power goes off you can lose samples because of contamination and other
issues," Mento said. "We are fortunate that our losses would be in having to
repeat an experiment -- but this could be really critical for companies with
drug manufacturing and issues of quality control."
The wireless firms along Sorrento Valley have not been immune from blackouts.
The lights went out at Qualcomm early this week, although executives declined
to comment about the impact.
No blackouts hit the big shipbuilding operations on the waterfront this week.
But the National Steel and Shipbuilding Co. -- one of San Diego's largest
employers -- already experienced a voluntary loss of power this year, its
first since World War II. Since the shipyard does not have its own power
supply, NASSCO executives fear the effect of unplanned outages.
"Our average payroll totals half a million dollars a day," said NASSCO
spokesman Jim Scott. "When you have a day's work disrupted, that can be
pretty serious. We're currently in discussions about the possibility of
buying from independent power suppliers, or setting up a power plant of our
own."
Small businesses, which constitute the bulk of employment in San Diego
County, were hurt by disruptions as well -- costing them vital revenue at a
time when their power bills have skyrocketed.
At Fantastic Sam's, a hair salon in Chula Vista, Angelica Alcala estimated
that business dropped 60 percent when the blackouts hit Tuesday. Among other
things, Alcala had to alter her planned haircuts because she was relying on
scissors instead of electric clippers.
At the Family Fun Center in El Cajon, the management gave vouchers or refunds
to the 15 or so video-game players who were in the midst of killing aliens or
fighting ninja warriors as the power went down.
Papa John's Pizza estimates that it may have lost several thousand dollars in
business after six stores were blacked out Monday and four others lost power
Tuesday. Brian Mills, who runs 23 Papa John's stores in the county, said his
main concern was shutting down the computers so they would not be damaged by
a power surge when the electricity was restored.
Paul Ecke III, a member of the West Coast advisory panel for the Federal
Reserve, said the potential impact of the energy crisis "is worse than any
downturn in the stock market."
Ecke, who runs the Paul Ecke Ranch flower operation in Encinitas, said the
crisis could be particularly harmful for the state's agricultural sector,
since farmers need electricity to pump water and natural gas to heat
greenhouses.
"What I'm really worried about is the energy thing is going to cast a shadow
on California," he said. "If you're a business person thinking about moving
to California right now, you're probably not going to do it because you're
not sure you're going to have your lights on this summer."
Besides the disruption to businesses, the energy crisis is also hurting the
pocketbooks of hourly workers who have been sent home during the crisis.
Under state law, employers are free to send hourly workers home without pay
during such emergencies, although salaried workers must still be paid.
Susan Kemp, an attorney with the California Chamber of Commerce, said there
are ways of minimizing the impact on hourly workers.
"You have to look at what time it is when the blackout occurs and how long
you think it's going to last," Kemp said. "If it's around a meal time, you
might send the workers out for a longer meal period if you think it's going
to be an hour or hour and a half delay."
But the potential for losing wages doesn't sit well with the hourly workers.
"When you get sent home early and lose your wages, you have even less money
to pay your inflated energy bills," said an hourly worker who was sent home
during Monday's blackout.

Out-of-state generators question power regulators' authority



By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS
March 22, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) At least three major out-of-state electricity generators are
challenging the authority of the California Public Utilities Commission to
investigate whether they deliberately reduced power supplies to drive up
prices.
The PUC has asked for power plant maintenance records as it tries to
determine whether Duke Energy, Dynegy Inc., Mirant Corp. and other
wholesalers have manipulated the energy market at California's expense.
At issue is who ultimately controls oversight of in-state plants that provide
most of California's electricity. The plants, once owned by the state's
largest utilities, were sold off as part of the state's 1996 attempt at
deregulation.








Report says power wholesalers overcharged California $5.5 billion
Disappearing state surplus sparks alarm
Outages darken economic outlook in state, some say
Allegheny Energy makes big California connection
Enron stock slides despite earnings reassurance
California's electricity crisis at-a-glance




PUC President Loretta Lynch said the public deserves to know whether
generators have unnecessarily taken plants off-line to create artificial
shortages, forcing the utilities and now state bureaucrats to buy much higher
priced power on the spot energy market.
"What I do know is we have historically high levels of outages across the
board," Lynch told The Associated Press. "Dynegy and Duke have been fighting
the PUC in the PUC's quest to obtain documents about these outages."
The PUC has the authority to regulate facilities within its borders, she
added. "It doesn't matter where the headquarters of the company is."
Duke, based in North Carolina, says it does matter ) and that since it and
other wholesalers aren't headquartered in California, the PUC can't require
it to turn over the maintenance records.
"We have not given them proprietary information because they do not regulate
us," said Duke's spokesman, Tom Williams.
Dynegy did not return calls for comment Wednesday.
The PUC also faces a new challenge in the legislature. A bill sponsored by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which would have granted the
PUC greater inspection authority over out-of-state generators, was amended
this month to grant the authority to Independent System Operator instead.
The ISO has managed the delivery of energy through most of the state's power
grid but historically has done little regulating and has had no policing
authority.
This board, created during the state's 1996 attempt at deregulation, was
redesigned in January. Now it has a five-member board appointed by Davis,
replacing a 26-member ISO board composed of utility executives, marketers,
power plant owners and others.
The latest version of Migden's bill requires wholesalers to report monthly to
the ISO about any plants that are off-line or working at reduced capacity,
and give

Greetings:
Steve Kean and I met today with Jack Stewart, Pres. of the California
Manufacturer's and Technology Ass. and Alan Zaremberg, CEO of the California
Chamber of Commerce.
Jack Stewart was happy to hear about our efforts and is generally
supportive--particularly regarding direct access--but wants more information
regarding the core/noncore proposal.  We have a meeting set up for Thursday
morning at 8 AM in the SF office to discuss it further.  Stewart will bring
Keith McCrea, long-time lawyer for CMA to the meeting on Thursday.
Zaremberg was extremely happy to hear about our efforts and the overall
package, and was much more receptive to the core/noncore proposal.  Though
he, too, would like more details.  Turns out the he and Bill Hauck--former
Wilson administration official and now head of the California Business
Roundtable---have been walking the halls of the capital urging the same thing
we've been urging, i.e., D's and R's need to get together (read "grow up")
and do a comprehensive deal.
Steve and I had an impromptu meeting with Hauck, and then I followed up with
him in the afternoon---he, too, is very supportive.
We stressed how important it is for business leaders to aggresively support
and pitch:
1) the idea that both sides of the aisle, and the governor, need to resolve
this now, and
2) the framework for a comprehensive solution along the lines that we've
described.
They agree, and while we have a good bit of additional work to due before
they are vociferous advocates for the core/noncore proposal, they certainly
didn't reject the idea.
Will report back on the Thursday follow-up with CMTA.

Fuel Guys,

The information that y'all had requested in the meeting does not contain any output or heat balancing information that you will need to assist in the sizing of the lateral.  Jennifer and I provided Fred Mitro information that contained capital cost, property taxes and some other modeling assumptions.  We did not give him any update or indication on where the output and heat rate numbers would be.

I have asked Jennifer to hold off sending you what was requested after today's meeting, because it is omitting the concrete information that you really need.  As soon as we receive new output and heat rate information, I will forward it directly.  If, for some reason, you need capital costs and property tax information, let me know.

Thanks,
Mathew

Jennifer,

Jeff has been tied up today and apologizes for not getting back sooner, but I
did manage to speak with him re:  the above.

SBX18, if passed, would provide for a Core/ Noncore customer split, similar
to that of the natural gas markets.  Utilities would be required to establish
a portfolio of electric supplies to serve the needs of bundled core
cusomers.  Ninety days after the end of the rate freeze, determined by the
Commission, customers  with loads greater than 500 kilowatts would not be
allowed to obtain service from the core portfolio.  Any noncore customer not
taking electricity directly from an ESP would be provided power by the
utility exclusively from the spot market and would be charged the cost
incurred by the  utility in providing such service.

Jeff's assesment is that the bill, in its current form, has less that a 50/50
chance of passage.  The bill is highly controversial pitting the core against
noncore customers.  Without any transition period, the bill could have a
significant negative impact to Enron's current book position.

If you have any additional questions, please feel free to call.

SBX 18

A store owner was tacking a sign above his door
that read "Puppies for Sale."
The signs have a way of attracting children.
Soon a little boy appeared at the sign and asked, "How much are you gonna
sell
those puppies for?".
The store owner replied, "Anywhere from $30-$50."
The little boy reached into his pocket and pulled out some change.
"I have $2.37, can I look at them?"
The store owner smiled and whistled.* Out of the kennel came his dog
named Lady, running down the aisle of his store followed by five little
puppies.* One puppy was lagging considerably behind.
Immediately the little boy singled out the lagging, limping puppy.* He
asked "What's wrong with that little dog?"
The man explained that when the puppy was born the vet said that
this puppy had a bad hip socket and would limp for the rest of his life.
The little boy got really excited and said, "That's the puppy I want to
buy!"
The man replied "No, you don't want to buy that little dog. If you
really want him, I'll give him to you." The little boy got upset. He
looked straight into the man's eyes and said "I don't want you to give him
to
me.
He is worth every bit as much as the other dogs and I'll pay the full
price.* In fact I will give you $2.37 now and 50 cents every month until I
have him paid for."
The man countered, "You really don't want to buy this puppy son.
He is never gonna be able to run, jump and play like other puppies."
The little boy reached down and rolled up his pant leg to reveal a
badly twisted, crippled left leg supported by a big metal brace.* He
looked up at the man and said, "Well, I don't run so well myself and the
little puppy will need someone who understands."
The man was now biting his bottom lip.* Tears welled up in his
eyes....He smiled and said, "Son, I hope and pray that each and every one
of
these puppies will have an owner such as you."
IN LIFE, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHO YOU ARE, BUT WHETHER SOMEONE
APPRECIATES YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE, ACCEPTS YOU AND LOVES YOU
UNCONDITIONALLY.
A REAL FRIEND IS ONE WHO WALKS IN WHEN THE REST OF THE WORLD WALKS AWAY.
SEND THIS TO ALL THE PEOPLE IN YOUR LIFE YOU CONSIDER TO BE SPECIAL.

When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of
John, do you truly love me more than these?'
'Yes Lord,' he said, 'you know that I love you.'
Jesus said, 'Feed my lambs.'...
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' He
said, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.'
John 21:15,  17b (NIV)

Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. The first time Jesus said,
"Do you truly love (Greek agape: volitional, self-sacrificial love) me more
than these?" The second time, Jesus focused on Peter alone and still used
the word translated into Greek, phileo (signifying affection, affinity, or
brotherly love) and asked, in effect, "Are you even my friend?" Each time
Peter responded with the word translated into Greek as phileo. Jesus doesn't
settle for quick, superficial answers. He has a way of getting to the heart
of the matter. Peter had to face his true feelings and motives when Jesus
confronted him. How would you respond if Jesus asked you, "Do you truly love
me?" Do you really love Jesus? Are you even his friend?

Dennis Montali
Bankruptcy Judge Faces Challenge of His Career
Well-known expert in complex cases

A veteran federal bankruptcy judge in San Francisco now is calling the shots
in California's long, drawn-out power crisis.
Judge Dennis Montali has spent eight years helping financially ailing dot-
coms, consumers and corporations get back on their financial feet. Now he is
about to take on the biggest case of his career, and lawyers say that he is
relishing the challenge.
"He's one of the best judges in the country," said Lawrence Goldberg, a San
Francisco bankruptcy lawyer with Goldberg, Stinnett, Meyers & Davis. "He
loves his job and he loves this kind of combat when lawyers come to court."
Montali, 60, has built a reputation as a hard-working, enthusiastic judge who
often knows the facts of a case better than the lawyers. He is a scholar of
bankruptcy law, having lectured and written law review articles. The more
complicated the case, lawyers say, the more energized he becomes.
On a personal level, he can strike the fine balance between the demands of
the commercial world and the plight of the consumer trying to overcome a
mountain of credit card debts, lawyers say.
"He's an excellent draw for the case," said bankruptcy lawyer Shawn
Christianson, with Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger. She said that Montali
has a combination of pragmatism, intellect and experience that will help him
understand the problems of all those involved in this statewide crisis.
Tall and lanky with a handle-bar mustache, Montali is a native of the Bay
Area. Born in San Francisco, his father worked as a liquor distributor and
later founded Montali Winery -- later Audubon Cellars -- in Berkeley. The
young Montali earned his undergraduate degree from Notre Dame University and
then entered the Navy to fulfill a Reserve Officers Training Corps
commitment.
After his discharge in 1965, he entered the University of California's Boalt
School of Law in Berkeley and earned his law degree in 1968.
He joined the law firm of
Rothschild and Phelan in San Francisco and quickly developed a specialty in
bankruptcy law. By the time he joined the legal giant Pillsbury, Madison &
Sutro in 1980 he was an established expert.
While he represented debtors early on in his career, he became a creditor's
attorney at Pillsbury and quickly built a national reputation for his
knowledge and his active role in the bankruptcy law community.
In 1993, the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco chose him for an opening
on the federal bankruptcy court in Northern California.
One of two bankruptcy judges in San Francisco, he has become an expert in
doing emergency surgery on companies in critical condition, able to deal with
crises quickly and with few complications.
He has gained national prominence as a member of the National Conference of
Bankruptcy Judges and the American College of Bankruptcy. He also was
rewarded with an appointment to the bankruptcy appellate panel.
When he's not bailing out a company, he spends his off hours cooking Italian
food at his Berkeley home with his wife, Mary. He also loves to sail, walk
his dog and spend time with his granddaughter.
"He's going to put his heart into this one," said Larry Engel, a veteran
bankruptcy lawyer with San Francisco's Brobeck, Phleger & Harrison. "He's got
the respect of everyone in terms of his fairness and diligence."
"California," he added, "is in really good hands in having the case with
him."

When to Hold 'Em, Fold 'Em: It might be a long time before PG&E shares
rebound
Kathleen Pender
Saturday, April 7, 2001

U172804.DTL
If you own PG&E stock, you really need to ask yourself whether you're
prepared to endure the agony of the next few years.
When companies go bankrupt, common stockholders are the last to be paid,
after trade, secured and unsecured creditors.
Because there are usually not enough assets to pay off all those creditors in
full, in many cases the creditors give up part of their claims in exchange
for stock in the reorganized company that emerges from bankruptcy. This
vastly dilutes the ownership stake of existing shareholders.
In many cases, the original shareholders end up with a small fraction of
stock in the reorganized company. And that's after a protracted court
proceeding that could take two to five years. During that period, there's
little reason for the stock to rise.
Although it was Pacific Gas & Electric -- PG&E Corp.'s utility subsidiary --
that filed for bankruptcy yesterday, stock in the parent company fell $4.18
per share to $7.20, and most Wall Street investors see little hope for a
quick rebound.
"This is going to be a long, drawn-out process," says Claude Cody, manager of
AIM Global Utilities Fund, which owns stock in PG&E. "There is going to be
negative news and positive news, and generally the negative news comes out
first."
Cody explains that when a company is in bankruptcy, the flow of information
slows down. Many institutional investors won't own stock in a bankrupt
company,
and analysts stop following it.
All the usual methods of valuing a stock, such as price-earnings ratios,
become meaningless.
Companies in bankruptcy hardly ever pay dividends.
PG&E has already suspended its dividend and won't pay one as long as the
utility is in bankruptcy.
That's hard on people such as Lee Fischer of San Bruno, who bought PG&E stock
20 years ago. Fischer, 72, says PG&E accounted for about 15 percent of the
stock dividends he depends on for retirement income.
"Everybody said, 'Buy utilities, buy oil, they're always going to be there, '
" he says.
"I'm pretty upset with our governor. I'm mad at PG&E. They're making
decisions we have no control over. I'm already losing the money I'm putting
into my monthly (utility) bills. It's not fair. My emotions are running
rampant at this point."
There are some reasons Fischer and other PG&E shareholders could fare better
than most stockholders involved in a typical bankruptcy.
For one thing, shareholders own stock in the parent company, which has some
unregulated energy assets that could provide cash flow and some support for
the stock price, provided that creditors of the utility can't seize the
assets of the unregulated subsidiary.
PG&E has taken steps to prevent that, but those steps are sure to be
challenged in court -- a process that could add to the length and complexity
of the utility's bankruptcy proceeding.
"In most bankruptcy cases, you don't have this two-sided isolation.
Shareholders are not getting money from a solvent side while there's an
insolvent side," says Lynn LoPucki, a law professor with the University of
California at Los Angeles.
Given its size, stature, the essential nature of its product and its
importance to the state's economy, some experts say PG&E's bankruptcy could
be resolved relatively quickly -- maybe in two years instead of three.
For the very same reasons, others say it will bog down.
PG&E stock is down 77 percent from its high last September. But that doesn't
mean it can't go lower.
Walter Torous, a finance professor at the Anderson School of Management at
UCLA, has studied what happens to stocks after bankruptcies and found that on
average, they don't do well.
"You'd think that if a company announces bankruptcy it takes a one-time hit.
But it continues to underperform badly over the long term. The market doesn't
seem to quickly incorporate this bad news," says Torous.
Torous tracked 78 large companies that filed for bankruptcy between 1979 and
1983.
He found that during the first year after they filed, their stocks trailed
the overall market by 38 percentage points. Over two years, they
underperformed by 57 percentage points. Over three years, they trailed by
almost 100 percentage points. (He explains that if the market went up 50
percent and the bankrupt stocks went down by 50 percent, they would trail by
100 percentage points).
Torous says that because the companies he studied all went bankrupt around
the same time, they might not be representative of companies going bankrupt
during other periods.
Marty Whitman, manager of the Third Avenue Value Fund, points out that in
past utility bankruptcies -- such as Public Service Co. of New Hampshire and
Northeast Utilities -- shareholders who held on came out well, after a number
of years.
"In other utility bankruptcies, they've all been reorganized on the backs of
the ratepayers and taxpayers," he says.
Whitman, who doesn't own PG&E stock but does own secured bonds in the
utility, was irate yesterday that PG&E didn't "prepackage" its bankruptcy.
That would have involved getting all the parties involved to agree to a
reorganization plan before filing for bankruptcy.
"If they did it preplanned, they could be in and out (of bankruptcy) in six
months," Whitman says.
Instead, he says it could take two to three years.
Mark Luftig, co-manager of the Strong American Utilities Fund, does not own
the stock and considers it a highly speculative investment. "If you can put
it away for three years, there's an above-average chance you'll get an above-
average return," says Luftig. "Will you miss a lot of sleep in the meantime?
Probably."
MOODY'S GROWS NERVOUS: Debt-rating agency Moody's said yesterday that it
changed its outlook on the state of California's general obligation bonds to
negative from stable, "reflecting our view that the deepening electric power
crisis -- compounded by (yesterday's) bankruptcy filing by Pacific Gas &
Electric Co. -- has increased the risks to the state's otherwise strong
fiscal and economic condition."
Moody's is the second bond-rating agency to warn that it might downgrade the
state's credit rating because of the power crisis.
In January, Standard & Poor's put the state's credit rating, currently AA, on
"CreditWatch" with negative implications.

NINE MONTHS LATER

Jack decided to go skiing with his buddy, Bob. They  loaded up Jack's
mini van and headed north. After driving for a few hours, they got caught in a
terrible blizzard. They pulled into a nearby farm and asked the
attractive lady who answered the door if they could spend the night.

"I realize it's terrible weather out there and I have this huge house all
to myself, but I'm recently "widowed," she explained. "I'm afraid the
neighbors will talk if I let you stay in my house."

"Don't worry," Jack said. "We'll, be happy to sleep in the barn. And if
the weather breaks, we'll be gone at first light"

The lady agreed, and the two men found their way to the barn and settled
in for the night.  Come morning, the weather had cleared, and they got on
their way. They enjoyed a great weekend of skiing.

About nine months later, Jack got an unexpected letter from an attorney.
It took him a few minutes to figure it out, but he finally determined that
it was from the attorney of that attractive widow he had met on the ski
weekend.  He dropped in on his friend Bob and asked, "Bob, do you
remember that good-looking widow from the farm we stayed at on our ski
holiday up
north?"

"Yes, I do.

"Did you happen to get up in the middle of the night, go up to the house
and pay her a visit?"

"Yes," Bob said, a little embarrassed about being found out. "I have to
admit that I did."

"And did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name?"

Bob's face turned red and he said, "Yeah, sorry, buddy.  I'm afraid I
did. Why do you ask?"

"She just died and left me everything."

(And you thought the ending would be different, didn't you?)

I know how incredibly busy you all are, so I'm sure that making a pledge to Jeff for the MS150 has simply slipped your mind.  Well the ride is this weekend, time is running out and we need you!

Enron's goal is to raise $700,000, and Jeff's personal goal is to raise $50,000.  As of today, we are a little better than half way there.  Won't you consider helping him reach his goal?

Thanks for your consideration.  I look forward to hearing from you tomorrow...

Curriculum Review Task Force (CRTF)
Report #5 to the Faculty (April 2001)

Since the last faculty meeting the CRTF has held two meetings, and a
subgroup of the CRTF met once. We are making careful preparations for our
April 17 & 18 meetings with the Consultant/Demographer, George Dehne, as
these events have strong curricular implications . On March 9, President
Giese, Dean Arnold and I had a lengthy conference call with George Dehne.
This call was very helpful in setting the stage for his visit. At our
request, he suggested a couple of research articles for us to read. The CRTF
found the following two articles very useful and discussed them in detail at
one of its meetings, and later, at the meeting of the subgroup: (1) "Another
Look at the Future of the Private College " (2) "The New Student Generation:
Are We Ready? Do We Care?" These articles are available in his firm's
website. If you would like to read them, please go to www.gdais.com and
access the link, News and Research.

George Dehne will make a presentation to the faculty on Tuesday, April 17,
2001 at 4 p.m. in the Highlander Room. The Planning Group has asked him to
address some specific issues as part of his presentation. A copy of my
letter to him in this regard is attached, herewith. The Task Force will
discuss the implications of his presentation at two subsequent meetings with
him.

As you know, Dr. Ronald Purser, a nationally recognized consultant/
facilitator, will work with us on May 16 and 17, 2001 to help us make some
strategic decisions regarding the future of our college. He will be using a
sophisticated approach, on which he has co-authored a book under the title
"The Search Conference: A Powerful Method for Planning Organizational Change
and Community Action." He has already sent us a copy of this book, and more
articles are in the mail. We will share the relevant material with you.

We are pleased to announce that a five-member team from our college has been
selected to attend an Institute on Campus Leadership for Sustainable
Innovation on July  10 - 15, 2001 in Leesburg, VA. It is being conducted by
the Association of American Colleges and Universities with the support of
the Carnegie Corporation of New York. Forty institutions from all over the
country are expected to participate in this Institute. About half of them
were invited as Leadership Institutions. Hence, there was stiff competition
for the remaining positions, and our team consisting of Haq, McGaan, Watson,
Arnold and Ambrose was selected on the basis of a five-page narrative we
wrote. The Institute, besides helping us become a strong "learning-centered"
institution, should be very valuable for our Curricular Review. The
Institute will, also, give us an opportunity to interact with some of the
leading colleges and universities which have successfully implemented
innovative, academic programs. Our team will share their experiences with
the campus community through a Fall Round Table. Thanks.

Dear George:
Preparations are underway for your visit both by the Office of Admissions
and the Curricular Review Task Force. The Task Force read your research
articles carefully and had a detailed discussion on several aspects of them
in their meeting on March 28. A subgroup of the Task Force is planning the
details of our meetings with you. We all feel that these events are very
important for our curricular initiative. We thought that we should let you
know some of our thoughts in relation to your research articles so that you
can possibly address them in your presentations and informal discussions.

A very important question for the Monmouth College community is how do we
position ourselves in the 21st century, taking into account (a)what the
students are looking for these days, (b)what the employers are expecting
from college graduates, and (c)what are the realistic market forces, and
thereby, develop a strategy to balance these important factors with the
liberal arts tradition and mission of our College. As you know, Monmouth
College belongs to the consortium, Associated Colleges of the Midwest. Among
the ACM Colleges, there are colleges like Carleton (in which you have served
before) and Grinnell who do not offer a Business program or prepare students
for Teaching Certification. However, in Monmouth, about two-thirds of our
students are in the Business and Education programs. We do try to teach our
Business, Accounting and Education courses from the liberal arts
perspective. Yet, we cannot deny the fact that these disciplines are more
profession-oriented than other disciplines like the hard sciences,
philosophy, classics etc. None of us wants Monmouth College to become
another vocational school. The realities (college finances, student base,
infrastructures etc.) are such that we cannot be a classic liberal arts
institution either like Carleton, Grinnell and Macalaster. Hence, the
crucial question for us is how do we position ourselves in this spectrum of
ACM and other nearby schools and develop a unique identity or niche for
ourselves. In abstract terms we want to be a true liberal arts college that
is sensitive to the market forces. What are your thoughts on this important
question?

On a less philosophical level, it will be helpful if you can develop for us
the demographics and student characteristics for Illinois separately and for
Illinois and its contiguous states. We are also interested in metropolitan
areas such as Chicago, where we have a strong student base, and American
minorities like Hispanics as well as Internationals. Who are the emerging
minorities in our region and what are their academic interests? How do we
attract the Asian population with their attraction for Sciences and big name
schools? When we look for out-of-state students, how does financial aid
plays into the admission/curriculum dynamics?

As we build the curriculum for the future we wonder what kind of academic
program will help us to attract and retain students. If we assume no serious
change in the student profile in the next 15 years, how should we
conceptualize our curriculum? If we assume continued changes in the student
profile of our region how dynamic and flexible our curriculum should be to
stay relevant in this fast changing world?

Your outstanding articles on "Another Look at the Future of the Private
College" and "The New Student Generation: Are we Ready? Do we Care?" Have
given us much to think about. In the first article, you are talking about
five kinds of small American Colleges (pp. 7 & 8). Monmouth College seems to
fall in the fourth group. Is this good or bad? What group should we ideally
aim for - given our circumstances? We have all these exciting questions to
some extent triggered by your thoughtful articles. We hope you can help us
to find some answers.

I will check with Marybeth regarding the material she is sending to you. We
shall send you a distribution of our majors. We will also send a copy of the
recent issue of our quarterly, Scotsnewse, which has a cover-page article on
our Curriculum Initiative. Please let us know if you need anything else. We
look forward to your visit.

Sincerely

Rajkumar Ambrose
Associate Dean of the Faculty
Chair, Curriculum Review Task Force

Curriculum Review Task Force (CRTF)
Report #6 to the Faculty (May 1, 2001)

Last Friday (April 27), during the presentation of the approved budget for
year 2001 - 2002, Dean Arnold announced that three tenure-track positions
will be available for the new curricular initiatives that may come out of
our current comprehensive curricular review. This commitment has been made
by the college administration on the assumption that we continue to maintain
our current enrollment and financial status . This is a tremendous
encouragement for our academic enterprise and on behalf of the CRTF, I would
like to thank President Giese, the President's council and the FIDC for
their continued support and encouragement for our Curricular Review.

Since our last faculty meeting, the CRTF has held two meetings. Its planning
subgroups also met twice. In addition, the CRTF had two lengthy meetings
with George Dehne besides participating in his presentation to the full
faculty. The discussions with George Dehne helped us to understand, to some
extent, the demographics of our region, what the present day students,
parents, and employers are looking for in college education, the type of
market forces we have to deal with, and future societal trends. It is very
gratifying to note that liberal education will continue to be in demand in
order to meet the needs of our fast changing world. The work load issue also
came up in our discussions. Dehne further pointed out that the 4 - 4 (two
semesters) calendar is not congenial for introducing curricular innovations.
We also got some insight into how other colleges are dealing with these
issues.

We are now getting ready for the two-day conference (May 16 & 17) with Dr.
Ronald Purser. We have already sent him plenty of material connected with
our curricular review, which he has read diligently. In the meantime, he has
sent us his book, The Search Conference: A Powerful Method for Planning
Organizational Change and Community Action, and other articles. Last
Wednesday, President Giese, Dean Arnold and I had a detailed phone
conversation with Dr. Purser. He mentioned that he is quite impressed by the
curricular review material we have sent him, and the progress we have made
so far. As ours is one of the biggest groups he has worked with, he is
bringing an Associate, Dr. Adrienne Gans, who is a clinical psychologist.
She got her doctorate from University of California, Berkeley and  taught
for a while in New York University before getting into the business world.
Both have considerable experience in working with a variety of organizations
that are planning to make significant changes in their communal enterprise.
The cover sheet of Purser's book states that "The Search Conference is not
just another management tool, but a participative  approach to planned
change that engages the collective learning and creativity of  large groups,
inspiring people to find common ground around new strategies, future
directions, and joint actions. The process combines the best practices
associated with strategic planning, systems thinking, and effective group
communications - enabling participants to take part fully, rise above
self-interest, and make decisions for the common good." This is exactly what
we would like to do soon after commencement!

Raj Ambrose
Chair, CRTF.

Mary --

I promised to let you know how it went with Adam Umanoff and Janet Ginsberg
of Business Week on her story about proposed cuts on renewable energy
research.  In the course of the interview, Janet introduced the word
"commentary" in describing the piece.  While her questions were on both sides
of the issue, she seemed to be leaning toward keeping the money for renewable
energy, particularly when you consider the things she told you over the last
couple of days.

Adam did a nice job of staying out of sandtraps, particularly when she asked
him about the argument of why the government should subsidize a deep-pocket
like Enron.  Adam responded that from the beginning it has been the
government's objective to get results from its research efforts, teaming with
corporate partners, and that companies like Enron have delivered.  She also
asked him if he thought budget cuts would have a catastrophic impact on the
industry, particularly the small players.  He said he could not speak to the
impact on smaller players and that, while the funding and the research are
important, he doubted that the result would be catastrophic.  Adam said that
he could not argue with the Energy Secretary's view that wind was one of the
mature renewables, and that we would not speculate about what Enron would do
if the funding went away.  Aside from that, he basically talked about the
importance of the research, the critical nature of continually renewing the
source, and the competitive landscape versus subsidized European firms.

Certainly if she wants to cherry pick Adam's comments to support either side
of the argument, she can.  However, Adam played it down the middle.

Thanks for all your thought on this.

Vance

In an Era of Deregulation, Enron
Woos Regulators More Than Ever
By BOB DAVIS and REBECCA SMITH
Staff Reporters of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
WASHINGTON -- Every energy executive in America would have liked a half-hour
with Vice President Dick Cheney as he fashioned the Bush administration's
national energy program. Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth Lay got it.
1
Mr. Lay used the time to set out an eight-point agenda intended, among other
things, to head off price controls on wholesale electricity, provide Enron
and other energy traders with unfettered access to the nation's
electricity-transmission system and remove regulatory obstacles to building
new generating plants and power lines. The energy plan President Bush
unveiled Thursday reflected many of those same priorities.
In an interview last week, the vice president said he also met with other
energy executives, but Mr. Lay was the only one he named. Mr. Cheney says he
sought Mr. Lay's advice because "Enron has a different take than most energy
companies."
Indeed, Enron Corp. is a modern paradox. It has transformed itself over the
past 15 years from a stodgy gas-pipeline operator into the nation's largest
trader of gas and electricity and a formidable player in newer markets such
as telecommunications services and emissions-reduction credits. Today, it's
the quintessential model of a company dedicated to free markets.

Yet as much as any company in the U.S., it has cultivated close ties with
government. Since the late 1980s, the Houston-based company, which was
President George W. Bush's biggest corporate campaign donor, has beefed up
its lobbying staff, boosted its political contributions and sought out
friends in the world of politics. Now, with Mr. Bush in the White House, it
is in a unique position to see whether those efforts will pay off.
Enron's lobbying blitz reflects one of the ironies of the era of
deregulation. Just as government created immense telephone, electric and gas
monopolies early in the last century, Enron and other players feel they need
the government's help in opening up those monopolies and gaining access to
once-closed markets.
In particular, Enron wants the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure
that energy is deregulated on terms favorable to the company. Rather than
having the nation's transmission lines controlled by the utilities, it wants
those lines to provide open access for new entrants such as Enron eager to
buy and sell power.
Mr. Lay is on a first-name basis with a half-dozen members of the Bush
cabinet and knows many senior White House staffers from their days in the
Texas governor's mansion with Mr. Bush. Before joining the administration,
both White House economist Lawrence Lindsey and U.S. Trade Representative
Robert Zoellick were on Enron's advisory board, which pays members an annual
stipend of $50,000.
Under Mr. Lay, Enron has donated nearly $2 million to Mr. Bush during his
political career. Since the start of the 2000 campaign, Enron and its
employees have contributed $1.3 million to the Bush presidential drive, the
Republican Party and the presidential inauguration, says the Center for
Responsive Politics. Enron also accounted for $461,000 in contributions
during Mr. Bush's two runs for governor, according to the Center for Public
Integrity.

Mr. Lay, who holds a doctorate in economics, says all he wants from
government is a fair shake. Enron supports candidates "you believe in," he
says. "You believe in their value system, you believe in their philosophy and
you believe they'll do the right things as leaders."
But it's clear that Mr. Lay wants more than that from government. For now, he
is focusing on FERC, where he worked in the early 1970s when the agency was
known as the Federal Power Commission. He hopes to make FERC his ally in
beating back the power of utilities. Long dismissed as a regulatory backwater
overseeing wholesale transactions by electric and gas utilities, the
commission has emerged as the chief navigator of the nation's transition to a
fully deregulated energy marketplace.
Even before Mr. Bush took office, FERC had begun to rein in the market power
of utilities. In December, FERC told the nation's utilities that it wanted
them to voluntarily surrender their high-voltage lines -- those that can
dispatch electricity across state lines -- to independent grid operators,
such as those already in place in California and the Northeast, which would
provide open access to the lines. Although it told the utilities to submit
plans for doing so, many of them have been reluctant to relinquish control of
their lines to such independent organizations.
Mr. Lay wants FERC to go further, forcing the utilities to cede direct
control of their lines. He also is seeking rules that would end what he calls
energy "balkanization" and create "seamless" interstate electricity markets.
"Enron is the biggest gas and electric company entirely dependent on the
competitive side of the business," says Andre Meade, an analyst for
Commerzbank. "To the extent deregulation slows down, their business slows
down."
Right now it's a lucrative strategy. Enron typically targets tightly
controlled markets just as they are opening up, using its financial clout and
risk-management savvy to gain a dominant market position. In doing so, it
frequently portrays itself as an insurgent taking on entrenched interests.
In electricity, for instance, Enron buys the output of generating plants,
sometimes days, weeks or years before the power is actually produced. Using
sophisticated weather data, it determines the most lucrative market for the
power, finds a buyer and then arranges delivery via transmission lines owned
by others. It hedges its positions with other contracts. Its wholesale
trading volume climbed 55% for natural gas and more than doubled for
electricity in the first quarter alone. Such growth pushed Enron's wholesale
energy-trading income, before taxes and interest, up more than threefold to
$785 million during the first quarter.
Between 1996 and 2000, Enron's yearly net income nearly doubled to $979
million and its revenue increased almost eightfold to $100.8 billion. Over
the same period, Enron's stock price, adjusted for splits, rose more than
fourfold.
At the start of the Bush administration, FERC's future was very much up for
grabs. Two of the five seats on the commission were vacant, and Enron quickly
sought to fill them with activist Republicans. President Bush named a friend
of his and Enron's to one of those seats: Texas utility-regulator Pat Wood.
Mr. Wood had worked closely with Enron during a six-year effort to open
Texas' retail electricity market. Mr. Wood also had shown the kind of
backbone Enron wanted in a separate fight over telephone deregulation when he
insisted on closely monitoring phone utilities to make sure they opened their
networks to competitors.
Higher Profile
For the second slot, Enron backed Nora Mead Brownell, a Pennsylvania utility
regulator. She had come to Enron's aid in 1997 when she voted to block an
electricity-market restructuring plan backed by Philadelphia's utility and by
GOP Gov. Tom Ridge. Enron argued that the plan would have locked it out of
the Philadelphia market.
Enron worked to raise Ms. Brownell's visibility by lobbying the House
Commerce Committee to include her as an expert witness on energy issues and
as a member of an informal advisory group, say Enron and congressional aides.
Mr. Lay provided heavyweight support. He says Enron included Ms. Brownell's
name on its "priority list" of a half-dozen prospective FERC nominees. And
when her candidacy ran into opposition from Pennsylvania officials with
bitter memories of her 1997 decision, Mr. Lay says he phoned Karl Rove, the
White House's top political strategist, to tell him that "she was a strong
force in getting the right outcome" in Pennsylvania."
A White House spokeswoman says that a number of individuals and industry
groups weighed in favor of Ms. Brownell, but she declined to name any. Ms.
Brownell says she was unaware of any concerted Enron campaign on her behalf.
She didn't ask the White House who had supported her because, she says, "I
didn't want to be beholden."
Meanwhile, Enron was using its Democratic contacts to strengthen its ties
with Linda Breathitt, a Kentucky Democrat on the commission. Earlier this
spring, the company hired two of former Vice President Al Gore's closest
friends as lobbyists: Nashville lawyer Charles Bones and Mr. Gore's
campaign-finance director, Johnny Hayes. Both had come to know Ms. Breathitt
through Democratic politics.
Ms. Breathitt says she wasn't very familiar with Enron's interests, but that
she accepted when Mr. Hayes invited her to dinner at a Washington restaurant
in April to meet Richard Shapiro, Enron's managing director for government
affairs. "Everyone likes to get to know the FERC commissioners," Ms.
Breathitt says, adding that she always pays for her own meals.
Enron has long played this kind of insider's game. Mr. Lay has been friendly
with both Democratic and Republican administrations over the past 25 years,
sharing time on the links with Presidents Bill Clinton and Gerald Ford. He's
been a particularly close friend of the Bush family. In the late 1980s, he
ran then-Vice President George H.W. Bush's fund-raising drives in Texas.
After the younger Bush became governor, he appointed Mr. Lay to run the
influential Governor's Business Council. Mr. Lay also made Enron's fleet of
corporate jets available to the new governor and won his help in lobbying
officials considering Enron projects.
In March 1997, Mr. Lay wrote Gov. Bush to ask that he lobby the Texas
congressional delegation to support export-finance credits critical to Enron,
according to letters released by the Texas State Archivist's office. In April
1997, when Enron was negotiating a $2 billion natural-gas joint venture in
Uzbekistan, Mr. Lay wrote to thank the governor for meeting with the
Uzbekistani ambassador to the U.S. Six months later, another Lay thank-you
note concerned a phone call Mr. Bush made to Pennsylvania Gov. Ridge to
support Enron's plan to enter the Philadelphia electricity market. "I am
certain it will have a positive impact," Mr. Lay wrote.
Mr. Lay says he hasn't sought Mr. Bush's aid directly since Mr. Bush won the
presidency. Last month, he talked with the president briefly at a Houston
benefit for the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy, on which Mr. Lay
serves as co-chairman. "It's not a matter of us going off hunting or fishing
or sitting around and having drinks," he says.
Not all Mr. Lay's initiatives have been successful. When Mr. Bush reneged in
March on a campaign pledge to fight global warming by requiring reductions in
carbon-dioxide levels produced by burning hydrocarbons, Mr. Lay says he
telephoned Mr. Cheney to complain. "The scientific evidence, although
certainly not conclusive, is pretty compelling that there could be a
climate-change problem," he says he told the vice president. "The
administration should still look very seriously at it."
Around the same time, Mr. Lay also called Mr. Rove, the White House political
adviser, to urge him to talk to Fred Krupp, the head of the moderate
Environmental Defense Fund. Messrs. Krupp and Rove spoke briefly but found
little common ground. Later, Enron, which has plans to add emission credits
to the commodities it trades, joined a coalition urging mandatory reductions
in carbon-dioxide levels.
But Enron saved its main lobbying push for Mr. Cheney's energy task force. In
April, Mr. Lay met with the panel's staff director, Andrew Lundquist, and
later, with Mr. Cheney, whom Mr. Lay had come to know well when the vice
president was chief of Halliburton Co., a Dallas construction company. "We
built Enron Field together," says Mr. Lay, referring to Houston's new
ballpark.
In both meetings, say Enron and White House officials, Mr. Lay presented a
broad agenda for opening up the nation's electrical system and used the
gas-transmission system as a point of comparison. In both cases, he argues,
pipelines and transmission lines should be like the federal highway system
that offers easy access to all.
Finding the Bottlenecks
The Cheney report uses similar language, describing the electrical grid as
"the highway for interstate commerce in electricity." As Enron sought, the
report directs the energy secretary to determine by the end of the year
whether it makes sense to establish a national grid, and to identify
bottlenecks in the transmission system as well as how to remove them. An
effort to make the grid national would enhance FERC's power, as Enron has
urged.
The report is mum on some Enron concerns, such as requiring utilities to join
regional transmission organizations, an idea strongly opposed by the utility
industry. A White House aide says the task force didn't want to get involved
in such battles between industries.
As solid as its support in the White House has turned out to be, Enron is
worried about the backlash against electricity deregulation in Western states
and possibly in New York, should electricity rates surge this summer. Nevada
repealed its deregulation law last month, spooked by the way skyrocketing
wholesale-electricity prices in neighboring California were undermining the
Golden State's economy. California and Oregon are contemplating
state-government purchases of major utility assets.
Enron's biggest fear is that the political pressure will lead the states, or
perhaps Congress, to control prices, which could undermine Enron's business.
In response, Enron has formed a coalition with eight other energy marketers
in New York, who each have pledged $50,000 to pay for a media and lobbying
campaign. It also has hired former Montana Gov. Marc Racicot and dispatched
him to court Western politicians. Two weeks ago, Mr. Racicot had breakfast
with an old colleague, Oregon's Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber. After the two
chatted about fly-fishing, says Mr. Kitzhaber, "Marc did say he was working
to re-energize the discussion about energy and had some ideas for a framework
the governors might want to consider."
Though Mr. Kitzhaber says he knew that Mr. Racicot had joined the Washington,
D.C., lobbying firm Bracewell & Patterson, Mr. Racicot didn't disclose that
he was on retainer to Enron -- and the star of Enron's Western states
"advocacy team." For his part, Mr. Racicot says he was working "not at
Enron's direction but with their knowledge" to advance positions that he,
too, feels are important.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


After speaking with George Phillips yesterday about SCE's counterclaim
against EES and EEMC regarding underreporting of usage to the ISO, I think
there may be some internal confusion (of which I may have contributed to)
about the nature of SCE's counterclaim.

As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE in
response to our data requests, review of an "Executive Summary" prepared by
George Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday,
EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, did
indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period
claimed by SCE.  This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (although
interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the
subject matter of its counterclaim.

First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges
to the market.  In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the
last quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the "cost to the
market" from the  EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead
market clearing price to the  individual  hourly variances.  This cost to
the market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account the
fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts
to get a net amount of underreporting.  This underreported amount is then
allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory
through the assessment of UFE charges.  Thus whatever the ultimate cost was
determined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount.

Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, in
SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased.  This
claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in
the way of UFE charges.  What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and
EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which
they reported to the ISO.  EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than
the amount which EES and EEMC reported.  SCE calculated the PX credit based
on the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are
not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC,
purchased those volumes.

It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of
SCE's counterclaim.  SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX
credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase.  SCE
is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO.  While
SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result
of  EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of its
counterclaim.

Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece of
information  to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreporting
of volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA
customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim?  and do we
have data to back it up?

As I discussed with the commercial group, it is very difficult to post a minimum NPV because it depends not only on the term but on other assumptions in James' chart as well.  (Steve can shed some more light on this if you see him at Keyex).
So I've recommended that we discuss with individual shippers what there needs might be as far as term, then give them a number.  They were planning on calling shippers individually anyway to make them aware of the Needles space.
We can use our chart as a go-by so everyone gets treated the same.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


The following report contains confidential and sensitive information.  Please
treat with discretion.

Executive Summary:
FERC price cap decision reflects Bush political and economic objectives.
Politically, Bush is determined to let the crisis blame fall on Davis; from
an economic perspective, he is unwilling to create disincentives for new
power generation
Davis finds four major flaws with FERC plan, most notably its exclusion of
out-of-state generators
June 1st "kill clause" for FERC order could coincide with new Bush regional
plan
California facing growing fiscal risk following bond downgrade, expected
$20 billion power bill this summer--economic crisis would force deeper
Administration involvement
QF bid for advance payments from PG&E likely to fail in bankruptcy court
New generation delays probable because of State/QF squabbling
Consumer groups are preparing a constitutional challenge to SoCal bailout
deal

1. FERC Fallout
The FERC decision is a holding move by the Bush administration that looks
like action, but is not.  Rather, it allows the situation in California to
continue to develop virtually unabated.  The political strategy appears to
allow the situation to deteriorate to the point where Davis cannot escape
shouldering the blame.  Once they are politically inoculated,  the
Administration can begin to look at regional solutions.  Moreover, the
Administration has already made explicit (and will certainly restate in the
forthcoming Cheney commission report) its opposition to stronger price caps
on the grounds that they are unwilling to create disincentives to the
construction of new generation.

It is interesting and ironic to note that electricity generators were
generally happy with the FERC order and that the only FERC commissioner who
favors price caps actually voted against this plan.

2. Something Less than Effective Price Caps
From Davis's point of view, the FERC plan has four major flaws:
The order applies only to California, not to the rest of the west.
Non-California generators are not required to sell at capped rates to
California.
As the order is written, it is more of a price floor for emergency power
than a ceiling.
State officials also believe that energy suppliers will continue to game
the system, because the price mitigation scheme only kicks in after a Stage 2
emergency and does not require any collusion.
Even when the price caps kick in, they are based on the cost-plus for the
highest cost producer supplying power to California and do not require
wholesalers to abide by the cap.  The generators can also charge above the
cap, provided they can subsequently justify the excess charge to FERC.

3. Proposal "Kill Clause" Adds to the Political Dilemma for Davis
The FERC proposal includes a "kill clause" that says the caps will be
withdrawn unless California's ISO agrees by June 1st to become part of the
regional grid now under FERC control.  If Davis doesn't sign on to the
regional grid by June 1st, then he will have to live with June 2nd headlines
blaming him for letting the "Bush price caps plan" collapse.

4. Growing Fiscal Risk in California
Sources speculate that California  could therefore pay as much as $20 billion
on power this summer - this is more  than the combined enterprise value of
PG&E and SCE.  These sources believe that, because of the severity of the
situation, the FERC and/or the  federal government will be forced to take
further action to control prices for  power.

The consensus is that the state of California will run out of money in about
90 days. One of the first projects to be cancelled will be state plans to
finance new power plant construction in exchange for long-term power deals.
The bleak fiscal picture is also causing bank creditors to revisit the bridge
loans they are providing to California.

The Bush Administration and the Fed are only now waking up to the seriousness
of the fiscal picture.  The country's largest and most prosperous state will
have gone from large surpluses to serious debt downgrades and devastating
deficits in a matter of months.

5. QFs to Seek Advance Payment from PG&E
Meanwhile, on the bankruptcy front, the QFs reportedly  will ask the
bankruptcy judge today to give them advance payment from PGE's  accounts,
since their natural gas vendors have likewise demanded advance payment  for
gas. It appears very unlikely that the QFs' request will be granted. If the
QFs do not receive advance payment, it is likely that most of the 4,000 mw
of gas-fired QF capacity will remain offline.

6 Delays Likely in New QF Generation
The QF deals made with the state for long-term contracts are  being
continually renegotiated, which is likely to mean that the new plants  those
contracts are supposed to finance will not be online as early as  anticipated.

7. Consumer Groups Ready to Challenge Constitutionality of SCE Bailout Plan
Harvey  Rosenfield and his colleagues reportedly have been reviewing an
analysis  of the MOU for the SCE bailout  plan.  The analysis was done by a
utilities analyst, rather than a lawyer, though it appears to raise a number
of  good legal points. For example, one of the elements of the MOU is a
"non-bypassable" charge  on ratepayers that would require  them to pay even
if they disconnect from the grid. This is effectively a tax,  since there is
no exchange of value  for money, which under the CA constitution cannot be
used to directly  benefit a private entity.  This makes  the bonds that would
be issued are general obligation bonds, rather than revenue  bonds. According
to the constitution, the state cannot be put into debt to  benefit a private
company.  For this and other reasons, even if the  Republicans would vote for
the SCE bailout, which remains  unlikely, the bailout probably would not
stand a likely constitutional challenge.

8. Governor Hurt by Continued Failure to Disclose Long-Term Power Contracts
The issue of the Governor's failure to  disclose the details of the long-term
power  contracts continues to  distress the other players in the  crisis.
Even if he were to  disclose everything he and his staff have been
negotiating, it is likely that their actions and negotiations will
challenged, creating an even further delay.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Mathew,
Per our conversation yesterday, I would reiterate the importance of a team
meeting on our potential project with the Seminoles given that there will be
a lot of complex legal structuring required for the project in addition to
all of the commercial structuring that you are still evaluating.
As a general rule, you should know that under federal law, Indian tribes are
legally treated as sovereign nations and so they are immune from regulation
by a state government and immune from federal and state court jurisdiction
unless they consent to it.  They are entitled to establish their own
governing laws and regulations and are subject to very unique federal law
requirements.  To illustrate, with respect to our potential project with them
it means we will need to address such issues as: (1) getting BIA approval for
our site acquisition on Indian land, non-Indians can only lease tribal land
and for our type of transaction, our lease will require approval from the
BIA; (2) tribal taxes may impact the facility; (3) tribal permits, licenses
etc will apply, including tribal environmental laws -- the tribe may have its
own tribal EPA for instance; (4) preserving the right to challenge any tribal
taxes or regulations in courts, other than the tribal courts; (5)
specifically getting waivers of sovereign immunity from the Tribe so that we
can subject them to federal court jurisdiction; (6) specifically ensuring
that the Tribe has complied with its own constitution and tribal rules in
executing agreements so that such agreements are enforceable; and (7)
specifically getting a waiver from the Tribe acknowledging and agreeing that
Enron is not subject to the jurisdiction of the tribal courts.  Evaluating
all of the above as well as the numerous other issues that will likely arise
will require consultation with and the cooperation of the Tribe.
As you know, I am still in the process of identifying outside counsel who is
an expert in Indian law matters.  As an update on that, our other Florida law
firm currently represents the Seminoles on other matters so they are
conflicted out of representing us.  Presently, I am waiting to hear back from
an Indian lawyer who was involved in the recent hotel/gaming development
transaction between the Seminoles and the Hard Rock Cafe group.  Although he
is based in Wisconsin, he is with a very large firm which has offices in
Florida and Washington, DC, and which currently represents Enron on other
matters.  After speaking with him, I will further debrief you and if we elect
to engage him, I will then seek my internal approvals for doing so.
In the interim, I have been receiving advice from a retired Vinson & Elkins
lawyer who has worked with Enron on its other dealings when Indian tribes
were involved (ie, right of way agreements involving our pipeline
companies).  He has prepared a brief memo on his views on our letter of
intent and general issues that arise when dealing with tribes.  I would be
happy to share that document with you (note that I have tried to summarize
most of it above.)  As a result of that memo, I do have some changes to
incorporate into our letter of intent and I am still waiting to hear from you
on how to modify the letter of intent based on your prior email.  (I also
have a more comprehensive legal paper entitled "Energy Business in Indian
Country: Opportunities and Obstacles" if you are having trouble sleeping at
night.)
Lastly, as for Bill Bryant's current activity below, based on what you've
told me and the email traffic, he seems as if he is looking at the right
regulatory issues, but with an area of law as so complex as this is, I would
caution that you and Marchris should narrowly define and monitor his
activities as it could otherwise quickly result in a very expensive research
project.
Thanks and please let me know when we discuss this project further.  At a
minimum, I would suggest that we try to focus on finalizing the letter of
intent with the Seminoles so that we can begin the process of exchanging
confidential information and entering into more substantive discussions with
them.

When they had finished eating, Jesus said to Simon Peter, 'Simon son of
John, do you truly love me more than these?'
'Yes Lord,' he said, 'you know that I love you.'
Jesus said, 'Feed my lambs.'...
Peter was hurt because Jesus asked him the third time, 'Do you love me?' He
said, 'Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.'
John 21:15,  17b (NIV)

Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. The first time Jesus said,
"Do you truly love (Greek agape: volitional, self-sacrificial love) me more
than these?" The second time, Jesus focused on Peter alone and still used
the word translated into Greek, phileo (signifying affection, affinity, or
brotherly love) and asked, in effect, "Are you even my friend?" Each time
Peter responded with the word translated into Greek as phileo. Jesus doesn't
settle for quick, superficial answers. He has a way of getting to the heart
of the matter. Peter had to face his true feelings and motives when Jesus
confronted him. How would you respond if Jesus asked you, "Do you truly love
me?" Do you really love Jesus? Are you even his friend?

Brudda,
I spoke with Jenn about accommodations in Beijing as well as Shanghai and
she said her dad is also getting some info from a local Chinese travel
agent.  How about dropping Dan a line and working with him to recommend &
book everyone's hotel.  His e-mail address is:  djunk_epc@yahoo.com
I believe part of the group is looking to Jon and the other part is looking
to Dan to make their accommodations for them. I hereby anoint the two of you
to make the lodging decisions for everyone else, as we are drooling cows
with no direction or relevant info.  Therefore, the two of you need to get
together and decide on a hotel (for Shanghai & Beijing), so we can all be
together and don't have to coordinate getting together everyday in freakin'
China (i.e. nightmare).  Jon maybe send an e-mail to Dan suggesting a few
hotels/price/level of accommodations/etc./your recommendation/ and then you
two make the call and book it for us.
I think the "core" group we should worry about getting
reservations/accommodations is as follows:
Shanghai: (arrival on the 5th, Jenn, Eric, Heather, Gayle, Dan, Gerald,
Barbara) 7 people-3 rooms for the night most likely (Jon you can crash in my
room)
Mom & Dad & aunt Jean and Kid arrive on the 6th (2 more room)
Jeff and Cathy arrive on the 7th (1 more room)
8th we all fly to Qing dao, hotel in Qing Dao is selected and booked
Beijing - Everyone listed above is traveling to Beijing as a group.
As far as getting rooms for the other people (Staters, Rassmussen's, etc),
that's your call, but we are operating without any real good info.  I'd say
they are on their own as we don't know when they get in, what their plans
are, etc?  If it's no big deal reserving rooms and not getting dinged if
noone shows up then maybe get a few extra rooms at certain places, I don't
know the Chinese hotel system, level of $$ exposure, hotel availability,
etc., its your call, I'd assume they can probably get a room no problem so
let's not try to coordinate more people than we have to, they can sleep on
my floor if they can't get a room in China....
This is what is called Wedding planning lotus bliss...
We are all looking forward to this...

Environment
Amory Lovins, CEO (Research), Rocky Mountain Institute
"Natural Capitalism: The Next Industrial Revolution"
Introduction by Dean Laura Tyson
Wells Fargo Room, Haas School of Business at UC Berkeley

Amory Lovins, co-author of Natural Capitalism, will discuss how changes in
natural capital (the natural environment and ecosystems that support all
human and economic activity) are already affecting the way we do business,
and how leading corporations are gaining competitive advantage through
superior environmental performance. He will talk about how corporations can
employ advanced resource productivity strategies to move toward becoming
ecologically sustainable, reduce environmental impact, and improve the bottom
line.

Mr. Lovins is the co-founder and CEO (Research) of Rocky Mountain Institute
(RMI), a nonprofit organization that assists businesses, communities, and
governments to create more wealth and employment, protect and enhance natural
and human capital, and increase profit and competitive advantage through
resource and operational efficiency. The Wall Street Journal named Mr. Lovins
one of 39 people world-wide "most likely to change the course of business in
the '90s"; Newsweek has praised him as "one of the Western world's most
influential energy thinkers"; and Time recognized him with one of their Hero
of the Planet awards.

Subject: Henry Ford and God




Henry Ford dies and goes to heaven. At the Gates, St. Peter greets Ford and
tells him, "Well, you've been such a good guy, and your
invention...the assembly line for the automobile...changed the world. As a
reward, you can hang out with anyone in Heaven you want."

Ford thinks about it, and says, - "I want to hang out with God Himself."

So the befuddled St. Peter takes Ford to the Throne Room, and introduces him
to God. Ford then asks God, - "When you invented Woman, what were you
thinking?"

God asks, "What do you mean?"
"Well," says Ford, "You have some major design flaws in your invention:
1. There's too much front end protrusion.
2. It chatters way too much at high speeds.
3. Maintenance is extremely high.
4. It constantly needs repainting and refinishing.
5. Every 28 days it leaks fluid and is rendered out of service.
6. The rear end wobbles too much.
7. The intake is placed too close to the exhaust.
8. The headlights are usually too small.
9. Fuel consumption is outrageous.

"Hummmm," replies God, "hold on a minute." God goes over to the
Celestial Supercomputer, types in a few keystrokes, and waits for the
results. In no time the computer prints out a report, and God reads it.
God then turns to Ford, and says, "It may be that my invention is
flawed, but according to these statistics, more men are riding my
invention than yours.

Heard from Lawrence this morning who said AB 60x (Hertzberg) is likely to be
heard in the Senate Energy Committee on Tuesday next week.  He said the
committee at this time is fairly neutral on the bill since he doesn't see
that it does anything.  He understands our problems with the bill, but
suggested we may want to recommend a solution.  IEP will be meeting with him
this afternoon to give him the problem at the 50,000 foot level.  Individual
companies may want to give him the specifics.
Where are we with our meetings with members of the committee?
IEP met with Kip in Sher's office who was noncommittal, but agreed with our
arguments against the bill. IEP's meeting with Alarcon was cancelled.  We
are trying to reschedule.  Since this is a special session bill, Dunn and
Poochigian will be voting on the bill.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


So the other disciples told him, 'We have seen the Lord!'  But [Thomas]
said to them, 'Unless I see the nail marks in his hands and put my finger
where the nails were, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe
it.'....
Then [Jesus] said to Thomas, 'Put your finger here; see my hands. Reach out
your hand and put it into my side. Stop doubting and believe.'" Thomas said
to him, 'My Lord and my God!'"
John 20:25, 27-28 (NIV)

Jesus wasn't hard on Thomas for his doubts. Despite his skepticism, Thomas
was still loyal to the believers and to Jesus himself. Some people need to
doubt before they believe. If doubt leads to questions, questions lead to
answers, and the answers are accepted, then doubt has done good work. It is
when doubt becomes stubbornness and stubbornness becomes a life-style that
doubt harms faith. When you doubt, don't stop there. Let your doubt deepen
your faith as you continue to search for the answer.

We tried so hard to make things better for our kids
that we made them worse.
For my grandchildren, I'd like better. I'd really like
for them to know about hand me down clothes and
homemade ice cream and leftover meatloaf sandwiches. I
really would. I hope you learn humility by being
humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being
cheated. I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow
the lawn and wash the car. And I really hope nobody
gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen. It
will be good if at least one time you can see puppies
born and your old dog put to sleep. I hope you get a
black eye fighting for something you believe in, I
hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger
brother. And it's all right if you have to draw a line
down the middle of the room, but when he wants to
crawl under the covers with you because he's scared, I
hope you let him. When you want to see a movie and
your little brother wants to tag along, I hope you'll
let him. I hope you have to walk uphill to school with
your friends and that you live in a town where you can
do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a
ride, I hope you don't ask your driver to drop you two
blocks away so you won't be seen riding with someone
as uncool as your Mom. If you want a slingshot, I hope
your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying
one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read
books. When you learn to use computers, I hope you
also learn to add and subtract in your head. I hope
you get teased by your friends when you have your
first crush on a girl, and when you talk back to your
mother that you learn what ivory soap tastes like.
May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn you
hand on a stove and stick your tongue on a frozen
flagpole. I don't care if you try a beer once, but I
hope you don't like it. And if a friend offers you
dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your
friend. I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch
with your Grandpa and go fishing with your Uncle. May
you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the
holidays. I hope your mother punishes you when you
throw a baseball through you neighbor's window and
that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time
when you give her a plaster mold of your hand. These
things I wish for you through tough times and
disappointment, hard work and happiness. To me, its
the only way to appreciate life. Send this to all of
your friends who mean the most to you. We secure our
friends not by accepting favors but by doing them.

I visited with Joseph Kaye last evening.  He is now in a private room, and is healing as fast as he can.  He is able to sit up by himself, and can walk the hall with assistance.  His remarkable recovery is,  no doubt,  due to his equally remarkable attitude.  His left arm is in a cast, and he is in a lot of pain from the fractures to his face and the back of his skull.  It's difficult for him to eat because of the discomfort remaining from the intubation which had kept him alive immediately following the accident.  In spite of all the above, he looks toward his full recovery and wanted me to tell you that he knows he is alive because of your prayers.
He was proudly wearing an MS150 "finish" pin on his hospital gown which Pat Bertotti took to him, and was thrilled with the  "finish" cap from Team Enron.
When I asked what he'd like to tell the team, he asked me to send you his love and his appreciation for your prayers.  He also asked that you always remember how precious life is, how precious our basic life functions are that we sometimes take for granted.....He shared with me that his Pedal Partner, Tim Hart, had come to visit him at the hospital to thank him for the effort he made to ride and raise money for MS.  Joseph knows that the pain and struggle he has now will be gone in time, but that his Pedal Partner has year after year to deal with the circumstances of managing his life with MS.
Joseph purchased, just before the tour, a great pair of sunglasses with prescription lenses.  They were totaled in the crash, and I thought it would be a good idea for the team to replace those glasses for him.   If you'd like to donate to this, please send your checks to me.  It wouldn't take much from each rider, and what we have left, we can donate to MS in Joseph's honor, since I'm sure he'll not be in any shape to collect his pledges before deadline, and I know he is concerned about the pledges he had promised.   He is very devoted to this cause.  Make your checks payable to Enron Cycling Club and send to address below.  (Please make sure if you are also sending a get-well card to Joseph to put your check in a separate envelope, as I do not open the correspondence you send to him.)  All riders donating to the glasses will have their names included on the presentation.  We have sent him a floral arrangmeent from the team for delivery today.
He enjoyed the mail you have sent, and if you have any more cards and letters please send to:
Amelia Alder, Enron Corp., P.O. Box 1188, Suite 3AC3120, Houston, TX 77251-1188
If you'd like to email him, please send to me and I will print out and deliver.

Executive Summary:

Bottom line- QFs better off today, utilities in worse shape
After passing Senate, the QF Bill fails on technical grounds in Assembly
Cal Energy ruling provides possible escape for QFs from utility commitments
California net short gas supply for the summer worsens if QFs break contracts
Hedge funds acquiring utility commercial paper, further litigation expected

1.	QF Bill Fails In Surprise Twist

AB 8X (the QF  bill) failed in the Assembly (48-24). The Republicans were opposed because three  measures, the SDG&E fix, the AB 1X fix, and the QF fix were all rolled  into one bill by the Senate. They want the three measures split up. Concern  was raised by San Diego members regarding those provisions and they wanted to  see it separately in the bill form that it is currently in SB 43X.   As noted yesterday, the QFs will now await a CPUC ruling on Tuesday.

2.	Cal Energy Ruling Sets Stage for "Dozens" of Similar Q.F. Suits

The CPUC ruling is now less important because of the Cal Energy ruling yesterday, which gave the QFs another tactic to escape their commitments to the near bankrupt utilities. Cal Energy reportedly would have filed an  involuntary bankruptcy tomorrow (Friday) had they not won their law  suit.  Dozens, if not hundreds of suits identical to  that filed by CalEnergy can now be expected from the other QFs.  The QFs  reportedly see themselves as free from the utilities now and want to sell direct  into the merchant market, possibly out-of-state.  They also want to avoid  any deal whereby the state would force them to supply power in a Stage 2 or  Stage 3 alert, and will contest any such measure with the FERC.

3.	Summer Outlook Worsens

The outlook for the summer now appears much  grimmer for the state.  If the gas-fired QFs alone manage to extricate  themselves from their contracts with the utilities, the state will be a net  10,000 MW short for the summer rather than 5,000 MW.  This is a much larger  net short position to fill, and will be much harder for State Treasurer Angelides to sell to  Wall Street.  If all of the QFs break their contracts, the state will be  14,000 to 15,000 MW short.  Essentially, if the QFs are successful in court  (as it appears they would be), they are no longer part of the pool of low,  fixed-rate power that the state can count on.  The onus now appears to be on Treasurer Angelides  to come up with a rate schedule.  The QFs may go to him and ask for the  state to act as forward cover for their gas contracts (the state would, of  course, charge for this privilege) and negotiate a more flexible rate  structure.

4	Pressure Mounts on Utilities

None of this helps the utilities'  situation.  In fact, now that the QFs have a way out of their contracts  through the courts, it appears that the business base of the utilities is  reduced, so they are actually in a worse situation.  Reportedly some of the utilities' commercial  paper now has been sold to hedge funds.  As one source put it, "the vultures  have moved in."  These are "the types of people who litigate."

for him to meet the rest of the team and get integrated into the larger
"national campaign".

****Friday's meeting is not a time for us to "debate" the issues.  A
forthcoming agenda will outline the specifics, but overall I am expecting
full commitment from everyone to a "strategic, coordinated, and organized
effort for the next 6 months".

See you in SF.

<FW: [Fwd: Fwd: The importance of typing your email

It seems there was this couple from Minneapolis who decided
to go to Florida for a few days to thaw out during this particularly
cold winter.
Since both spouses worked, they had difficulty coordinating their
schedules, so the decision was made to have the husband leave
for Florida on a certain day, with the wife following him one day
later.
The man made it down to Florida and arrived at his hotel.
Upon getting to his room, he decided to open his laptop and
send his wife back in Minneapolis an email. However, he left off one
letter in typing his wife's email address and sent the email off without
realizing his error.
In another part of the country, a widow had just returned from the
funeral of her husband, a Methodist pastor of many years, who had
been called to glory just a few days earlier. She decided to check her
email because she was expecting to hear from her husband's relatives
and friends. Upon reading the first email, she let out a loud scream,
fainted and fell to the floor.
The woman's son rushed into the room and found his
mother on the floor. He glanced up at the computer screen and saw
the following email message:

To My Loving Wife:
I've just been checked in. Everything has been prepared for your
arrival here tomorrow. Looking forward to seeing you then.

Your Devoted Husband.

P.S. Sure is hot down here.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Please see the following important stories.  It appears to be quickly
slipping through Davis' fingers.  May be useful to re-group a bit in light of
the following events.  In sum:
Most importantly, in today's Chronicle, it's reported that Davis' staff met
with key Democrats yesterday and lowered the boom.
DWR purchases likely to be about $25 billion and rates may have to go up by
100%.  (See attached story.)
Apparently, one of the big reasons that 8X got held up yesterday is because
Davis' own staff went to D leadership and said, "don't move 8X (a bill that
Davis was said to support) because the $10 billion cap on bonds won't work;
they need much more."
It appears that rate increases will now become part of the mix, whether Davis
likes it or not.
The staff alleged that they were conveying the information before Davis had
been informed of the "bombshell."
Davis was criticized for being at yet another fund-raiser yesterday while the
situation significantly deteroriated in Sacramento.  (See attached story.)
Meanwhile, PG&E has sued--or may be about to sue--the State, saying they
won't pay the QFs according to Davis' plan (which the PUC is supposed to
implement on Tuesday).  (See attached PG&E press release.)
Finally, Mike Kahn has issued an opinion piece in yesterday's Chronicle, in
which he attempts to lump together into one pile Republicans, market
proponents, price gougers and Texans, and defending Davis and Lynch.

Davis' Measured Plan To Fight the Darkness

COMMENTS on Gov. Gray Davis' energy programs by apologists for former Gov.
Pete Wilson bring to mind Robert Kennedy's admonition that it is better to
light a candle than curse the darkness.
Let's examine the darkness created by Wilson's energy deregulation scheme.
The 1996 law he signed could not have been more wrong headed.
-- Why did it hand energy price control over to the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission?
-- Why did it free wholesale prices, while capping the price utilities could
charge customers?
-- Why did the former state Public Utilities Commission force utilities to
sell off their fossil fuel power plants, leaving them vulnerable to predatory
pricing by out-of-state merchant generators?
-- Why did the Wilson-era PUC bar utilities from entering into contracts to
ensure a long-term supply of cheap electricity?
-- Most pointedly, why did California enter into deregulation without enough
available generation to ensure a fair market based on balanced supply and
demand?
These are tough questions. It is not hard to understand why former proponents
of the 1996 deregulation scheme would rather not answer them, preferring to
bemoan the darkness and curse Davis' actions.
The Wilson apologists jeer at plans for the state to purchase the power grid,
though they surely know the value of a well-maintained, fully functioning
electric transmission network. Bottlenecks in the grid impede the sharing of
power between Northern and Southern California. This was a main reason
Northern California experienced rolling blackouts in January while Southern
California had plenty of power.
The state's purchase of the grid will infuse new cash into the utilities,
pulling them back from the brink of bankruptcy, while giving the state a
tangible and valuable asset in exchange.
And ownership of the grid will allow the state to modernize it, removing
bottlenecks and upgrading technology - something the utilities have long
failed at doing.
The apologists ignore the state's strong record on energy conservation and
Davis' actions to enhance these efforts.
California now has the nation's second-best energy conservation record. The
governor has budgeted $404 million in new conservation measures and added an
executive order offering 20 percent rebates to those who reduce their
consumption 20 percent over last year. These measures will reduce commercial
lighting, encourage residential and industrial efficiency and make state and
commercial buildings more energy efficient.
The apologists disregard the fact that the governor has also reversed a trend
that had seen power plant construction in California drop to insignificance
in the '80s and '90s. Since April 1999, the California Energy Commission has
licensed nine major new power plants. Six are under construction. This is
part of a streamlined, fast-track plant licensing process that aims to put an
additional 20,000 megawatts on line by the summer of 2004, a nearly 50
percent increase in generation.
And the apologists refuse to recognize that California is building the right
sort of power plants - efficient, clean and environmentally friendly, with a
strong bent toward renewable power sources.
In fact, while some would go Texas' route and build plants that meet only the
bare minimum of environmental requirements, California is continuing the
effort that has made it the nation's leader in the use of clean, renewable
power sources.
Instead, the apologists engage in name calling, such as the charge leveled by
former Wilson communications director Dan Schnur on this page that Loretta
Lynch, the Davis appointee as PUC chair, is inexperienced and has failed to
deal effectively with the energy emergency.
Forget for a moment that of the 22 people who have served as PUC
commissioners since 1980, only six had any energy expertise before their
appointments.
Forget for a moment that one of the principal architects of deregulation was
Daniel Fessler, the UC Davis contract law professor with no special expertise
in energy issues whom Gov. Wilson appointed as PUC president.
Just consider this: It was the PUC under Lynch that freed the utilities to
buy electricity on cheaper, forward contracts outside the Power Exchange.
This corrected a huge Wilson-era PUC blunder that put utilities in an energy
price straitjacket. The Lynch-led PUC also prohibited utilities from selling
additional power plants, and it began the successful effort to make
California's ISO (the Independent System Operator that runs the state's power
grid) independent of the industry-connected officials who controlled it.
Meanwhile, what sort of grand solutions have the apologists presented? Drill
for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska, build nuclear
plants on closed military bases and encourage the construction of dirty
Texas- style power plants in California.
Drilling in the Arctic will not produce a watt of new power for California.
Californians have long said they do not want the risks presented by new
nuclear plants.
And lax Texas pollution rules prompted the Dallas Morning News to charge in a
Dec. 17 editorial that Texans are choking on the exhaust from power plants.
Most disingenuously, the apologists would "let the market work," claiming
that unfettered market forces will soon bring fair and balanced prices. But
the market doesn't work now, as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has
repeatedly admitted, most recently with its finding that generators
overcharged the state in January.
Unfortunately, for the most part the same commission had refused to clamp
down on sky-high prices charged by generating companies. Look at New York's
deregulated market, where there are no caps on retail electric prices. Market
forces have done consumers there little good. New Yorkers pay the highest
prices for electricity in the country. And the New York Times has reported
that rates paid by consumers have increased a whopping 40 percent just since
1999.
Those who would allow the market to work (let the darkness reign) know well
that if the market "works" to produce New York-style rate increases in
California, the consequences to the public would be dire.
Compare this to Gov. Davis' well-structured plan for effective energy
conservation and stabilization of the state's electricity market and his
expedited program to bring clean, efficient new power plants on line quickly.
Robert Kennedy would understand Gov. Davis' approach and his critics'
perspective.

Bombshell Warning on Power Cost
Spending may double and rates skyrocket, governor's office tells Legislature
Greg Lucas, Lynda Gledhill, Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

N176940.DTL
Top Davis administration officials told lawmakers yesterday that the state
may have to spend twice as much as expected on electricity purchases over the
next two years - requiring rate increases of as much as 100 percent.
The stunning admission by the Davis administration contradicts his repeated
promises that his plan to ease California's energy woes could be done without
a rate increase.
California will probably need to issue $23 billion in bonds for electricity
buys, more than double the amount Davis said would be needed by the state to
keep electricity flowing until California's cash-poor utilities can get back
on their feet.
Administration officials told lawmakers to stop action on a bill that would
have capped the state's energy purchases at $10 billion.
But a Davis spokesman said the numbers were far from firm.
"There are a lot of scenarios being run . . . and until we complete the
negotiations, this can be added up any way you want," said Steve Maviglio,
press secretary to Davis.
"Those numbers are not based on any reality right now," he said. "There are
too many things up in the air."
Assembly Democrats told a different story.
They said Tim Gage, director of Davis' Department of Finance, Cabinet
Secretary Susan Kennedy and John Stevens, Davis' top energy aide, met with
Assembly Democratic leaders and dropped the bombshell.
And they did so just as those same leaders were trying to convince fellow
lawmakers how important the bill was to the Davis administration.
They also said that Davis, who was in the Palm Springs area for most of the
day and briefly attended a fund-raiser at a golf club, was unaware of the
figures.
PURCHASES IN BILLIONS
The three top aides said that electricity purchases for this year by the
state would be $16 billion, not the $10 billion initially predicted. An
additional $7 billion in state power purchases would be needed next year,
they said.
The state has been buying power at a clip of $45 million a day since Jan. 17
because the troubled utilities could no longer afford to make the purchases.
From the start of the energy crisis, the state has planned to repay its power
purchases through bond sales. The bonds would be paid off by a portion of the
amount ratepayers are charged on their monthly bills.
Davis has so far insisted that enough money could be found to cover the $10
billion without raising rates.
But his aides said if the size of the bonds ballooned to $23 billion, a hefty
rate increase would be necessary.
INCREASE UPON INCREASE
The Public Utilities Commission is already planning to make permanent a
temporary 9 percent increase. An additional automatic 10 percent is scheduled
for no later than March 2002.
But the aides said, on top of that, an additional 60 percent to 80 percent
increase would be required to cover the debt service.
"For some time, I have believed a fundamental part of solving this problem is
admitting there needs to be a rate increase, and the numbers that have been
shared today make that inevitable, and we should start dealing with the
reality as soon as possible," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder Creek
(Santa Cruz County).
One consumer advocate said the revelation means the utilities are closer to
bankruptcy because the state and ratepayers won't have the cash to bail them
out.
And it could mean political trouble for Davis.
"Unless the governor issues an ultimatum to lower the prices, everybody's
bill will double, and he will not be able to run for re-election in 2002,"
said Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights.
PG&E THREATENS SUIT
The news came as Pacific Gas and Electric Co. threatened to take the state to
court over Davis' plan to force the company to pay back certain creditors.
Davis' proposal would require the utilities to pay alternative power
generators for all the power that they supply, something PG&E said it cannot
afford to do. Several of the generators shut down earlier this week as
rolling blackouts spread across the state.
The bill stalled yesterday in the Assembly as Republicans objected. Lawmakers
will resume debate Monday.
Earlier in the week, Davis announced that action would be taken by the
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission that would guarantee payment
to the alternative energy providers. He also said the state -- which has
spent $3.7 billion to purchase power -- should be paid back first.
Without that promise, several of the small biomass, solar and wind producing
plants -- called qualified facilities -- said they would have taken Southern
California Edison Co. into bankruptcy court. The alternative generators
provide enough electricity to power roughly 6 million homes.
PG&E said it cannot afford to pay the alternative producers and reimburse the
state for the billions it has spent purchasing power.
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," Gordon Smith, PG&E's
president and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
DIFFERING VIEWS ON COSTS
According to PG&E's numbers, the company collects $400 million a month in
rates. It says the average price to pay all the generation sources exceeds
$1. 4 billion a month.
But consumer advocate Nettie Hoge said the utilities are exaggerating their
own costs in order to try to keep as much money as possible.
"It's just absurd," said Hoge, the head of The Utility Reform Network. "They
have a temper tantrum every time something doesn't go their way."
The bill PG&E objected to is necessary to allow the PUC to order utilities to
pay small power generators who agree to sign lower-priced contracts to
provide energy.
The proposal offers generators a choice of agreeing to a five-year contract
at $79 per megawatt or a 10-year deal at $69 per megawatt, Davis said. The
going rate now is about $150 a megawatt. The PUC wants to act as early as
Tuesday to bring some financial relief to the generators, who have been paid
pennies on the dollar.
Assembly Republicans objected to the bill in part because it would allow the
PUC to change the formula for setting the price paid alternative producers so
that it no longer considered the price of natural gas.
Co-generators -- some of the largest of which are operated by oil refineries
-- say without the price of natural gas as a consideration, it would cost
them more to produce energy than what they would be paid for it.

Davis at Fund-Raiser as His Bill Languishes
Critics say he should have been at Capitol

While the Assembly struggled -- and failed -- to pass a bill aimed at keeping
hundreds of small energy generators from bankruptcy, Gov. Gray Davis attended
a $10,000-a-head golf fund-raiser yesterday in Palm Desert.
Organized by Duane Dauner, president of the California Healthcare
Association, the event was held at Bighorn Golf Club, a luxurious private
country club of which Dauner is a member.
Davis' top political adviser said the governor didn't play golf, just stopped
by a luncheon before the round began so he could return to Sacramento.
But during Davis' absence, a bill he backed -- critical to bailing out small
power generators -- languished in the Assembly.
On Thursday, lawmakers canceled next week's long-planned annual trip to
Washington, D.C., to focus on energy issues.
"There is not a lot of electricity to be found on the golf course," said
Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, a chief
critic of Davis and the state's utilities. "He ought to be in Sacramento to
try and solve the crisis and not prospecting for contributions in the grass
in Palm Springs."
The Democratic governor has been frequently criticized for the time he spends
raising money for his campaign fund, money that comes from well-heeled
interests with dozens of issues pending before his administration.
Since becoming governor, Davis amassed $25 million by the end of 2000 --
averaging more than $1 million a month in contributions, often from fund-
raisers directed at specific industries.
Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said Davis was in Palm Springs to
dedicate a University of California building and "dropped by a lunch"
preceding the golf.
South said the fund-raiser "was a diverse group of people that paid varying
amounts of money."
Lawmakers canceled their yearly visit to federal officials on issues
important to the Golden State because they didn't want to give the impression
that "there was somewhere else more important than California," said state
Sen.
Don Perata, D-Oakland.
Raising money at a tony golf resort during the crisis simply looks bad,
Perata said.
"We have to be really careful because the public's patience and their
confidence in what we're asking them to do depends on how they see us
reacting to the problem," he said. "This will be negatively interpreted."
Other lawmakers said the governor's top-level staff was working on the
problem but acknowledged the golfing fund-raiser looked bad.
"It's not the best symbolic message, but I feel we have to give him the
benefit of the doubt," said Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco.
Davis did appear briefly yesterday on nationally broadcast CNBC to talk about
the energy crisis and blast power generators for allegedly overcharging the
state. He appeared live from Palm Springs.
The California Healthcare Association represents nearly 500 hospitals and
boasts on its Web site that it "influences public policy development through
both legislative and regulatory advocacy efforts."
Last month, the group introduced a legislative package to expand nursing
education and streamline college requirements for nurses.
One of the bills calls for spending $120 million a year on nursing classes.
The group also is lobbying the new Department of Managed Health Care, which
is staffed by Davis appointees, to speed up payment of $1 billion in late
bills owed to hospitals.
Davis signed a bill last year that gave the HMO czar the power to sanction
health care plans for failing to pay Dauner's clients, the hospitals, on
time.
In his first six months in office, Davis attended a fund-raising dinner at
Dauner's house that brought in an estimated $100,000. It was part of a spree
that netted the governor a record-breaking $6.1 million in half a year.
At the time, Dauner told the Los Angeles Times: "We don't talk policy at
those kinds of things, or legislation. This was really more of a social
event. He talked about his goals and probably spent more time discussing
education than anything else."
Dauner could not be reached for comment yesterday.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE March 23, 2001

PG&E Responds to Energy Proposals in Sacramento
San Francisco -- Pacific Gas and Electric Company today announced that it
will be forced to challenge actions now being contemplated by the State of
California to impose new demands on its frozen rate structure. The proposed
actions will destabilize its current situation with creditors and put the
entire possibility of reaching a balanced solution to California's energy
crisis at risk.
This week, the State has made clear its intention to use Pacific Gas and
Electric Company's existing rate structure to begin fully paying Qualifying
Facilities (QFs) in advance, for future power purchases, starting April 1,
and to reimburse the Department of Water Resources (DWR) in advance of any
other generating source, including utility-retained generation, bilateral
contracts, QFs or the Independent System Operator (ISO).
"These actions approach the problem in a piecemeal and uncoordinated fashion
and would force us to pay out far more than we collect in rates, further
exacerbating an already precarious financial situation," said Gordon R.
Smith, president and chief executive officer of Pacific Gas and Electric
Company. "The numbers just don't work."
Currently, under frozen rates, Pacific Gas and Electric Company has been
collecting approximately $400 million per month for the purchase of electric
power. This revenue has been used in payments to power suppliers, including
power purchases from irrigation districts and bilaterals, to cover costs of
operating our retained generation, and is insufficient to cover payments to
the ISO and QFs. The average combined energy bill from all of these sources
exceeds $1.4 billion a month, and may go even higher in the coming months.
Moreover, the utility's financial condition has been further jeopardized by
the failure of the DWR to acknowledge responsibility for the full "net open
position," i.e. the power that must be purchased on the spot market. This
dispute over the net open position is threatening to accrue additional
liabilities for Pacific Gas and Electric Company.
"We continue to work with State officials to develop a constructive,
comprehensive solution that assures that California has a reliable and fairly
priced supply of power. Nevertheless, we have a duty to our suppliers,
lenders and shareholders to protect the assets of the utility, and we must
challenge any action by the State to force us to pay out more than is
collected in rates," Mr. Smith concluded.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


A couple of months ago, we formed a new group within EPSA called the
Regulatory Affairs, Washington Staff, group (the name needs some help).  We
discussed many things the group can do to increase our EPSA presence at FERC,
including establishing monthly lunches featuring a different FERC
guest/speaker per lunch.

Yesterday, Donna and I attended the first lunch of the group, sponsored by
Mirant (Enron will be sponsoring the July lunch).  The FERC guest speaker was
Don Gelinas.  (We believe Don had a big part in the Entergy Source & Sink
order, so he is an important person to know.)  There were about 12 people at
the lunch, which was a good number because it gave us all a chance to speak
with Don and get to know him a little better.  The group was relaxed and
festive, and I think this put Don at ease as well.

Don made a few remarks at the end of the lunch.  He said the Commission's
main focus (other than California) was on the RTOs and getting them up and
running by the end of the year.  He said FERC's main concerns are on:
1)independence, 2) appropriate incentives, and 3) appropriate scope.

Don acknowledged that having sufficient scope is a problem with a voluntary
program, but he believes the Commission, under Hebert's leadership, will be
able to gradually expand the scope of the RTOs so that ultimately there are
only a handful of RTOs in the country.  Furthermore, Don said there are
certain issues he believes must be included in RTO filings, including putting
native load under the RTO tariff.   However, he says that phase-in may be
necessary, and the trick will be in finding a reasonable phase-in period.

Other issues that Don said may require actual FERC decisions (FERC calling
balls and strikes) will be on issues such as ATC, CBM and curtailment.  Don
said ATC should be calculated the same way by all RTOs and that the question
of retaining CBM must be decided by FERC.

Based on these comments, these three areas may be places where we could get
some FERC support for our views.  We should keep this in mind as we comment
on future RTO filings.

Let us know if you have any questions or comments.

To  provide him with sage-like advice and help him prepare (in what may be called a  double-vision quest) for his day of reckoning, my brothers and I are planning to  take Rich on a pre-wedding retreat. In all likelihood this weekend will be the  last one of July (27-29), with the first one of August (3-5) as a backup  date.  The locale will probably be Lake Travis outside of Austin (see www.bartoncreek.com  for more information  about accommodations).  Early morning golf, swimming, evening entertainment  in Austin are the planned activities.
Certainly more information  will be forth coming, but if joining Rich for this weekend is something you  would be interested in doing, then please contact me.  My home # is  860-435-1389.  My emails are tom_pastore@indianmountain.org   and pastore@discovernet.net   .   I hope to hear from you.

Tom Pastore

Talked to Mertz last night. Take this for whatever it is worth...
Bottom line is that he says the lease I sent him, 16,000 per year for
2002
to 2005 looks good, it is the money he wants, we take good care of his
place, shoot mature bucks and we will get the lease, BUT he won't sign
the
lease until next fall, "because I don't have to". Whatever.
I said we just wanted to know for certain that we had a place to hunt
for
the next four years and wanted to make sure we did not need to start
looking
for another lease. He said we had the place and not to worry about it,
he
just wanted to see how the new protien program panned out before signing

off. Once again, whatever. He also says he's pouring the stuff out heavy

right now.
He gave me his word and seemed upbeat about everything. I'm going to
leave
it at that until next fall. I'm not going to worry about it anymore. His

great deal on the Zander's old lease fell apart on him (he was suppossed
to
have out of state hunters show up for two weeks and they were going to
pay
him 30k a year). Maybe the concept of some good lessees who pay on time
and
take care of his land will look more realistic and attractive.
He, as usual, stressed his never ending desire to grow a big deer. He's
counting on this new super food to do it this year. I guess the best we
can
do to assure a lease renewal is to hunt hard and kill him some big deer.

Site in your guns and bring plenty of ammo next fall.
Erik.

As I previously shared, the result for vandium in the low-sulfer diesel (#2 fuel oil) came back at <0.1 ppm versus the "spec" of <0.05 ppm.  I just talked to the lab supervisor at Saybolt whom performed the analysis; and according to him there is no practical way of measuring the vanadium content more precisely than within one-tenth of a ppm.

The only way he knows of is to use a NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) machine that NASA uses to analyze rocket fuel.  He is not sure whether or not the government would allow use of such a machine but estimates that, if they did allow, it could cost upwards of $10,000.

Please let me know if we should pursue this matter any further.

CABLE, BROADCAST, DBS, CE, PHONE PLAYERS DUEL OVER ITV POLICY

04/06/2001
Public Broadcasting Report
(c) Copyright 2001 Warren Communications News, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
Cable operators, programming networks, broadcasters, DBS providers, consumer
electronics interests, Bell companies, ISPs, sports leagues, software
developers, electronic program guide creators, personal video recording firms
and consumer groups all battled over possible interactive TV (ITV)
regulations at FCC. In comments filed in response to Commission's ITV
inquiry, 28 entities debated whether federal govt. should regulate nascent
interactive market in wake of AOL's takeover of Time Warner (TW) earlier this
year. They also feuded over how govt. should define interactive services if
it chose to regulate them.
Pushing for "technologically neutral nondiscrimination safeguards" on such
vertically integrated MSOs as AOL TW, group of major programmers urged FCC to
mandate that all broadband distributors carrying any ITV signals forward
signals for all programmers on their cable systems. Group, consisting of
Disney, Univision, USA Networks and Viacom/CBS, also called on Commission to
ban discriminatory routing or caching practices that would permit cable
operators to send their affiliated programming at faster speeds than rival
networks. Programmers contended that consumers shouldn't have to buy
additional set-top box to receive unaffiliated ITV services. "It is far
easier and requires far less intrusive government regulation to prevent
monopoly power from distorting a relatively new market than it is to combat
monopoly power already unleashed in a more developed market," group said.
Public interest groups, ALTV, APTS, BellSouth, EarthLink, Gemstar-TV Guide
International, MSTV, NAB, PBS (PBR March 23 p3) and SBC Communications all
made similar arguments in favor of FCC's adopting ITV rules. For instance,
joint filing by Media Access Project, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of
America and Center for Media Education called on Commission "to move
expeditiously to begin a rulemaking establishing open access for providers of
enhancements on all platforms, whether cable, DBS, DTV or new technologies
yet unknown." They contended that agency's failure to act would allow cable
MSOs to "become the gatekeepers of what has thus far been a gateless online
community" and devastate independent content providers. Without safeguards,
they said, "ITV is likely to become a digital mirror image of the current
closed multichannel cable model."
Regulatory opponents countered that imposing ITV restrictions on cable
systems would discourage them from starting new services, hampering
development of emerging industry. Opponents, including AOL TW, AT&T,
Cablevision Systems, Charter, Canal Plus Technologies, Comcast, NCTA, NFL,
OpenTV, Progress&Freedom Foundation and group of 4 programmers, declared it
was too early to impose obligations on ITV providers. They said early
regulation would be unworkable, creating administrative nightmare.
Calling even "the threat of regulation" of ITV market "a major mistake,"
NCTA, for example, argued that "there is simply no basis for assuming a
problem and proposing regulatory solutions." Saying FCC deliberately had
refrained from imposing similar rules on cable high-speed data services,
which are much further along in development, NCTA said Commission should
refrain from regulating ITV services for same reason. It also warned that
agency had very limited authority to regulate ITV services under
Communications Act and easily could violate First Amendment rights of cable
operators if it tried to do so. Calling inquiry "a peculiar and misguided
proceeding," NCTA said First Amendment "would seem to preclude the very
regulations suggested by the notice which would interfere with cable
operators' constitutionally protected editorial judgments."
Taking different tacks, DBS providers EchoStar and DirecTV said in separate
filings that they wanted FCC to keep close tabs on cable operators so they
wouldn't use their market power to keep interactive TV services from other
multichannel operators, including satellite TV companies. DBS companies said
they were concerned that cable companies might have unfair advantage in
marketplace if both industries were regulated in same way by Commission.
DirecTV said it was "premature" for agency to fully regulate ITV services,
but it favored "continued monitoring by the FCC of the potential for
anticompetitive behavior by cable operators." "Regulatory intervention at
this nascent stage of ITV development makes little sense," DirecTV said:
"There are as yet no dominant providers of ITV services, and the marketplace
is still in the process of sorting out the technological standards" that it
will follow during future delivery. EchoStar said there was "absolutely no
basis for imposing" ITV carriage obligations on distributors lacking market
power in any relevant market such as itself. Such action would penalize new
entrants and favor incumbent cable operators, filing said.
FCC/CAPITOL HILL
In action that will significantly limit number of low-power FM (LPFM)
stations to be licensed, FCC released decision April 2 saying LPFM stations
must meet same 3rd adjacent channel interference protection requirement as
full-power stations. Order implements requirements of rider on FCC
appropriations bill signed into law in Dec. Commission expects to complete
action on its LPFM licensing window in few months, it said in order, and then
will direct Mass Media Bureau to open window to allow LPFM applicants that
didn't meet 3rd channel requirements to try to come into compliance. FCC
Chmn. Powell said action allowed Commission to begin granting construction
permits for at least some LPFM stations, and agency had begun independent
testing to determine impact of LPFM stations on full-power FM stations and
translators. As part of order, FCC also implemented congressional mandate
that denies LPFM license to former pirate radio operators. FCC Comr.
Furchtgott-Roth issued separate statement saying he supported move to
implement congressional mandate but believed FCC should have delayed LPFM
licensing while it went through rulemaking process in order to comply with
Administrative Procedure Act.

Sen. Cochran (R-Miss.) introduced S-604 to reauthorize PTV's Ready to Learn
and Ready to Teach programs. Bill also would graduate Mathline, a component
of programs providing professional development models for teachers of
mathematics, to TeacherLine, more comprehensive professional development tool
for K-12 teachers. Citing research by U. of Ala. and U. of Kan., Cochran said
Ready to Learn was having positive impact on children and their parents.
Studies showed that Ready to Learn families read books together more often
and for longer periods than nonparticipants. Surprisingly, studies said Ready
to Learn children watched 40% less TV and were more likely to choose
educational programs when they did watch, he said. Advent of digital
broadcasting, which allows broadcast of multiple video channels and data
simultaneously, will make it possible for instructional materials to be
distributed on full-time, continuous channels when teachers and students need
it, Cochran said.
------
FCC regulatory fees would increase average of 7.75% for FY 2001, agency said
in proposed rulemaking released March 29. Fees generally followed previous 2
years' practice of across-board increase to meet congressional mandate for
FCC to recoup larger portion of its operating budget through regulatory fees.
Congress required Commission to collect $200.1 million in regulatory fees
this year, up $14.4 million from FY 2000. In early years, FCC attempted to
base regulatory fees on actual cost of regulation, but it generally has used
across-board increases since FY 1999. It said it hoped to have new cost
accounting system in place in time for setting fees for FY 2002. Comments on
fees are due April 27, replies May 7 (MD 01-76).
------
Heads of 4 national public broadcasting organizations and many local PTV
station managers expressed appreciation at April 3 gathering in Washington to
Public Broadcasting Caucus in House which now has 70 members. Saying public
broadcasting always had enjoyed strong support in Congress, CPB Pres. Robert
Coonrod said new group would be asset in furthering that support "for our
mission of providing valuable education services to the American people." NPR
Pres. Kevin Klose said he hoped caucus would serve as effective forum for
discussion of complex policy issues facing public radio. Pres. Pat Mitchell
said "PBS looks forward to working with the caucus to strengthen the unique
and important role that public television plays in providing nonviolent and
educational programs and services to America's children and their families."
New APTS Pres. John Lawson said caucus came at "critical" time, when PTV
stations were bracing for transition to DTV.
------
If FCC reallocates any part of Instructional TV Fixed Service (ITFS) spectrum
or 3G mobile device service, "the capacity, usefulness and value of ITFS
would be significantly reduced," Miss. Humanities Council said in ex parte
filing on notice of proposed rulemaking on 3G spectrum allocations. Even if
only part of spectrum is taken away, many educational institutions would
either lose their ITFS service altogether or face new equipment costs,
service disruption, cutbacks, lower quality of service and signal
interference, council said. "In either scenario, the ITFS community would be
incapable of supporting advanced wireless services and promoting the
development of broadband services to the educational community and to
underserved communities nationwide," it said.
------
FCC Chmn. Powell called on Congress to bolster agency's enforcement powers,
measure he said was necessary to protect consumers as Commission executed
streamlined business plan that's "aligned with the realities of a dynamic and
converging marketplace." He also told House Telecom Subcommittee at hearing
March 29 that legislative approval was necessary to carry out his bureau
restructuring plan, which still was being formulated, and his "policy vision"
of making FCC more "efficient, effective and responsive." Powell said FCC, if
given sufficient enforcement capabilities, would guarantee "fairness to all,
and allegiance to none," but warned potential regulatory violators that
Commission likewise would levy severe penalties. "If you cheat, I'm going to
hurt you, and hurt you hard," he said. Ability to impose heavier fines and
having fewer time constraints to carry out enforcement action via changes in
statute of limitations are 2 tools Congress could give FCC, Powell said. If
Commission can fine a company only $15,000 when companies earn millions or
even billions of dollars annually, then they will view fines "just as the
cost of business" and have less incentive to comply, he said. Commerce
Committee Chmn. Tauzin (R-La.) said Powell spent 3 years as commissioner
"watching how not to run the FCC" and expressed confidence that under his
leadership it "would become an agency that fosters innovation and investment
rather than one that inhibits the deployment of new services." He told Powell
he would work with him to "rationalize the structure" of agency so services,
rather than service providers, are subject to regulatory or deregulatory
framework.
------
Communications lawyers on Washington Legal Foundation panel on FCC and
Communications Policy split 2-2 on whether major revamp of FCC was needed
immediately. "It's hard to disagree about the need to overhaul the FCC," said
attorney Nick Allard of Latham&Watkins. Moderator and former FCC Chmn.
Richard Wiley did disagree, sharply, with Allard -- who called for abolishing
4 of 5 commission seats and actively involving Commerce Dept. and NTIA in
regulation of various communications industries. What FCC needs, countered
Wiley, is more delegation of authority to staff and more rapid decisions --
something that can be accomplished with present structure -- and "Chmn.
Powell can get it done." Because of congressional respect for Powell, any
agency reform "is going to come first from the FCC itself," rather than from
Hill, Wiley predicted. Panelist Charles Kennedy of Morrison&Foerster
generally agreed with Allard, while David Poe of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Greene&MacRae
partly sided with Wiley. Commission doesn't need revamping for short term,
Poe said, but major overhaul may be necessary in long term. Kennedy said FCC
operations were "outmoded... We are going to have to make some fundamental
changes... if things don't turn around." Allard listed 10 questions that must
be answered on FCC's future, including whether competition was prerequisite
for deregulation or was it other way around and did Commission's current
organizational structure make sense. Poe said Powell had shown "he's not
afraid to grapple" with tough issues and that there were many "ambiguities
and contradictions" in 1996 Telecom Act. "Statutory reform" of FCC is needed,
he said, but it will be very hard to get Congress to pass legislation on
issue. On digital TV, Poe said FCC had tried to push broadcasters into new
technology but "you can't make a market if the market isn't there."
------
FCC set deadlines March 28 for comment on its proposed rulemaking on DTV
must-carry issue following publication of notice in Federal Register.
Commission tentatively concluded in Jan. against imposing dual-carriage
obligations on cable operators during current digital broadcasting transition
but left issue open for final determination. Comments are due May 10, replies
June 25.
------
Rep. Boucher (D-Va.) challenged TV copyright owners concerned about piracy
from digital set-top boxes to "present a united front" on what home copying
they would accept in exchange for encryption technologies. At kickoff of
American U. Washington College of Law's new Glushko-Samuelson Intellectual
Property (IP) Clinic, he said he hoped Congress would approve measure akin to
Sec. 1201(k) of Digital Millennium Copyright Act. That Act requires VCRs to
respond to technologies encoded on videocassettes to stop people from copying
films where there's no reasonable expectation of being allowed to do so (as,
for example, when movies are rented from video store).

All--here's some thoughts on the RGA related events.  We currently have Ken
scheduled to participate in an energy roundtable discussion on the afternoon
of the 2nd with at least four governors attending that session--Kempthorne,
Hull, Geringer and Ridge.  (Engler and Rowland are also attending the overall
event, but they will be in a healthcare breakout session).  Kaufman and I
thought that it would be particularly helpful for Arizona Gov Hull and Idaho
Gov Kempthorne to hear Ken's remarks and have a chance to talk with him.
I have also been working with Rosalee to schedule an early evening
(6:00-7:00pm) meeting that night  with Exelon co CEO John Rowe. John Rowe
will be in California for some investor meetings and well as attending some
sections of the RGA events.  I have told my counterpart at Rowe's office that
we would confirm Ken's availability on Monday morning.
If you do decide that Ken should attend the Davis meeting in Sacremento that
day instead, we will just reconfigure a bit.  Paul and I will cover the RGA
events and I will cancel the John Rowe get together. I would also want to
talk about having Mr. Lay reach out to Hull and Kempthorne via phone sometime
in the near future.  Same with Rowe.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


After speaking with George Phillips yesterday about SCE's counterclaim
against EES and EEMC regarding underreporting of usage to the ISO, I think
there may be some internal confusion (of which I may have contributed to)
about the nature of SCE's counterclaim.

As I understand, from my review of certain documents received from SCE in
response to our data requests, review of an "Executive Summary" prepared by
George Phillips on the issue, and from my conversation with him yesterday,
EES and EEMC, as a result of some problems with their settlement system, did
indeed underreport customers' usage to the ISO during the time period
claimed by SCE.  This has, I believe, resulted in two separate (although
interrelated) points of contention with SCE -- of which only one is the
subject matter of its counterclaim.

First, the underreporting resulted in Unaccounted For Energy (UFE) charges
to the market.  In correspondence sent by SCE to EEMC and EES during the
last quarter of 2001, it appears that SCE was calculating the "cost to the
market" from the  EES/EEMC underreporting by applying the hourly day ahead
market clearing price to the  individual  hourly variances.  This cost to
the market is overestimated, however, as SCE failed to take into account the
fact that the ISO nets underreported amounts against overreported accounts
to get a net amount of underreporting.  This underreported amount is then
allocated to all providers of physical load within a service territory
through the assessment of UFE charges.  Thus whatever the ultimate cost was
determined to be, SCE would not be allocated the entire amount.

Second, the underreporting of usage to the ISO results, according to SCE, in
SCE paying EES and EEMC a PX credit for energy they never purchased.  This
claim is separate and apart from what SCE claims EES/EEMC cost the market in
the way of UFE charges.  What SCE is saying is that it believes that EES and
EEMC only purchased on behalf of their customers the amount of energy which
they reported to the ISO.  EES' and EEMC's customers actually used more than
the amount which EES and EEMC reported.  SCE calculated the PX credit based
on the amount used, not reported. It is SCE's claim that EES and EEMC are
not entitled to a PX credit on the delta as the market, not EES and EEMC,
purchased those volumes.

It is only the second point of contention which is the subject matter of
SCE's counterclaim.  SCE is alleging that it should not have to pay a PX
credit to EES and EEMC for volumes that EES and EEMC did not purchase.  SCE
is claiming that we only purchased the amount we reported to the ISO.  While
SCE may believe that it should not have to pay any UFE charges as the result
of  EES/EEMC underreporting, the UFE charges are not the basis of its
counterclaim.

Based on the above analysis, I think that the most critical piece of
information  to refute the counterclaim is that, despite the underreporting
of volumes to the ISO, EES and EEMC actually purchased on behalf of their DA
customers those customers' full usage. Can we make such claim?  and do we
have data to back it up?

We agreed to take the additional volume for the remainder of the evening only.

Saturday 3/24 - 7:30 am, received page from Lee in Gas Control regarding the Gulf Plains Plant, apparently they felt that they may need to overdeliver for Saturday's gas day as well.  Phoned Larry Zammit and spoke with him regarding the situation at the plant, he indicated that there may have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding at the plant.  Larry phoned the plant and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver to,  or swing on, HPL.

2:00 pm - Phoned Lee in Gas Control to see how the pipeline was doing.  He indicated that we were pretty tight, but would probably make it without utilizing any OBA's.

Sunday - So. Union requested 15M beginning at 11:00 am. The pipeline was tight again, but Gas Control was okay.

I think there is only one point of view. We should defend Annex V. We want to
preserve US$ 60 million in EBITDA for Elektro in 2001

Luiz Travesso (AES) was quite aggressive last Saturday in trying to convince
me otherwise. Needless to say, he did not.

My view was to defend contract sanctity, which for him is a [minor] detail.
He screamed loudly and swore to God he was not going to pay if Tiete gets
short. I said he would better discuss this issue in court, as opposed to
killing the messenger.

Demostenes (AES) defended the idea that ANNEX V is a risk sharing mechanism
between Gs and Ds and because of this those should sit down again and agree
on a new risk allocation mechanism. This is wrong.  I helped design Annex V.
The only reason why ANNEX V is there is to mitigate the isk for generators,
not distributors. (statistically, a generator will not able to deliver its
assured energy in 5 out of 100 years) Any amendment to Annex V will push
risks/costs back to Elektro.

The argument that rules are being changed is weak. No rules are being
changed. Annex V was part of the initial contracts and prices accordingly.
When Luiz Travesso replied that he overvalued Tiet^ during its privatization
because he did not take Annex V into account I expressed my sympathy.  I told
him to hire more competent investment banks next time.

We should not fall into the trap of killing Annex V because all generating

Steve knows I am pissed about this and in our Arcos meeting I brought up the
same point raised by Kay below.  Steve claims that the no cap on gov.
violations was rejected some time ago by GE mana. when Barnas presented to
them an update of the "end world hunger".  Steve also thinks that they had
told us previously about this change.  ( Is this true???)  I told him it was
news to me and that I would have thought that if true, then GE would have (a)
highlighted the changes on the draft contract and/or (b) added it to the list
of outstanding issues.
When asked to explain the rationale for changing their position on this
issue, Steve was unable to give an answer other than to say GE mana. had said
that they needed to cap their liability at the contract price for gov.
violations although they thought GE could live with no cap on FCPA violations.

Mary Magdalene went to the disciples with the news: 'I have seen the Lord!'
And she told them that he had said these things to her.
John 20:18 (NIV)

Mary didn't recognize Jesus at first. Her grief had blinded her; she
couldn't see him because she didn't expect to see him. Then he spoke her
name, and immediately she recognized him. Imagine the love that flooded her
heart when she heard her Savior saying her name. Jesus is near you, and he
is calling your name. Can you, like Mary, regard him as your Lord?"

New poll suggests Californians haven't been this gloomy for years
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Not since the mid-'90s have more Californians believed
the state is headed in the wrong direction.
And it may get worse. Nearly 60 percent of state residents expect the economy
to worsen in the next year, while about 40 percent see a brighter horizon,
according to a new poll.
The telephone survey of 2,001 adult Californians was done over eight days in
early May by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California. The poll
was conducted in English and Spanish.
The twin culprits were the souring economy and the electricity crisis.
"Californians clearly see the electricity crisis as a harbinger of other
growth-related problems," said Mark Baldassare, the research institute's
survey director. "This crisis and general economic uncertainty have severely
undermined public confidence in California's future and in its leaders."
Change has come swiftly.
In January, 62 percent of state residents said California was headed in the
right direction, compared to 48 percent this month.
Other key findings include:
82 percent of respondents said population growth over the next 20 years will
make California a less desirable place to live.
86 percent of respondents said the electricity crisis will hurt the state's
economy.
43 percent of respondents favor building more power plants, up from 32
percent in January. The second most popular solution, re-regulating the
electricity industry, was the favored solution in January.
Traffic congestion, affordable housing, air pollution and a shortage of good
jobs top the list of negative consequences respondents foresee from the
state's population growth.














Grid officials, others studying planned blackouts
By Jennifer Coleman
Associated Press Writer
SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Could Californians be waking up to hear a weather report,
a pollen count and an electricity blackout forecast?
It's not out of the question, say some lawmakers.
"I actually think it's a thoughtful plan ... to give folks an opportunity to
understand the likelihood of blackouts on a daily basis," Assemblyman Fred
Keeley, D-Boulder Creek, the Assembly's point man on energy.
Keeley compared it to "weather forecasting, to be able to look at the next
three or four days, have a percentile about the likelihood of blackouts."
The Independent System Operator, keeper of the state's power grid, is
expected to release a report Monday detailing how such a plan would work.
The idea is "to provide a lot of information so people can make choices to
live with blackouts on a temporary basis this summer," Keeley said.
Peter Navarro, a University of California, Irvine, economics professor,
released a report last month with a consumer group that recommends the state
set a price limit on what they'll pay for power. And if generators don't
lower the price, the state should schedule blackouts to cut consumption, he
said.
The report by Navarro and the Utility Consumers' Action Network says the
state's current method of "highly disruptive random rolling blackouts" needs
to be revamped.
UCAN suggests that the state be divided into blackout zones that utilities
could notify ahead of time that power would be cut at a specific time and for
a certain duration.
Scheduling blackouts could attract criminals to outage areas, Keeley
acknowledged, and possibly could subject the state to legal liability for
traffic accidents or other incidents if power is deliberately shut off.
"That is a genuine problem and genuine concern," Keeley said. "I think we
would have to work with local governments so they could have a sufficient
advance notice to be able to foresee that and try to deploy their resources
appropriately."
Critics of the planned blackouts said power producers simply could sell their
unused electricity to other states, or trim back production to keep supplies
short.
Assemblyman Mike Briggs, R-Fresno, plans to introduce a bill this week that
would have the Public Utilities Commission notify businesses and homeowners
as much as one month ahead of time when they would have their power cut.
"We owe the people of this state some kind of schedule," Briggs said. "If
businesses and individuals knew what days their power could potentially be
shut off or blacked out, they could plan for that blackout accordingly."
The Central Valley Republican said the ability to plan for outages would be
especially benefit farmers, who need power to irrigate their crops.
Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, who convened a special subcommittee on
blackouts, has also suggested the state should consider scheduling daily
blackouts to cut the state's power use and drive down prices. Democratic
Assembly members plan to introduce their own version of a blackout plan.
Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, has said she envisions giving consumers
three to five days notice that their power will be cut during a particular
period, so businesses could opt to shut down or shift their operations to
nonpeak hours such as nights and weekends.
And by treating blackouts as a first option rather than a last resort, the
state could cut its peak power needs and drive down prices, Bowen said.
California power consumers would in essence form "a reverse cartel to stop
the market manipulation and the price gouging," she said.
The planned blackout suggestions come as state officials grow increasingly
concerned that power prices will keep rising this summer, even beyond the
extraordinary levels the state already has been paying on behalf of three
cash-strapped privately owned utilities.
Gov. Gray Davis said the state paid $1,900 per megawatt hour at one point
last week.
The state has dedicated $6.7 billion since mid-January to purchase power for
Pacific Gas and Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas and
Electric.
Those expenditures will be repaid this summer when the state issues $13.4
billion in revenue bonds. The bonds will be repaid by ratepayers over 15
years.

Governor told to try seizure in power war



By Philip J. LaVelle
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 19, 2001
A major San Diego business group urged Gov. Gray Davis yesterday to take
emergency steps in the energy crisis, including seizing power plants -- an
action the governor said may be in the cards.
Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego
Building Owners and Managers Association, overseers of about 250 commercial
properties here.
The meeting, at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown, was closed
to the media.

In remarks to reporters later, Davis repeated his hard line against
out-of-state energy producers, relating a threat made to a dozen power
executives in a private meeting May 9.

"I told the generators face to face, as close as I am to you ...
'Gentlemen, you are going to lose your plants, and I'm going to sign a
windfall-profits tax, unless you help us get through this summer without
blackouts and without staggering prices.'"
Davis also said he told them: "You know you've been ripping us off, acting in
a predatory manner. If you do it this summer, you leave me no choice but to
take your plants and sign a windfall-profits tax. So the ball is in your
court, gentlemen."
Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had "a frank
exchange" with Davis. "We want to do our fair share (on conservation), but
we're also concerned about the supply side," he said. The group "strongly
urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary, including
seizing plants."
Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of
conservation measures. Yet some cannot be implemented without state
intervention, she said. For example, Davis urged that air-conditioning
thermostats be set at 78 degrees, but "a lot of our leases don't permit it,"
she said.
While in San Diego, Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree from
Scripps Research Institute.





Davis intensifies attacks on Texas firms



By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 19, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis is stepping up his attacks on Texas energy
companies, shifting blame in the California electricity crisis to the home
state of President Bush.
"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price-gouging us,"
Davis told reporters while responding to Bush's energy plan this week. "Many
of those companies are in Texas."
The governor suggested that most of the power plants that California
utilities sold under a failed deregulation plan were purchased by energy
companies in the Southwest.
Anyone could have purchased the California power plants, Davis said, "but the
people who bought them just happened to be from the Southwest ... "
However, a state Energy Commission report shows that when California
utilities sold more than 20 power plants capable of producing 20,000
megawatts, Texas firms purchased plants producing about 7,000 megawatts.
Davis also suggested that the Bush administration is failing to give
California the same price relief on electricity that Texas has imposed on
itself.
"So if Texas can have some kind of price relief," Davis said, "I think
California is entitled to price relief."
But the cap that Texas adopted in March prevents energy companies from
offering to sell power for more than $1,000 per megawatt-hour -- far above
the $346 average that California expects to pay for non-contracted power this
spring.
The campaign operation for Davis, who is up for re-election next year and has
been mentioned as a potential Bush opponent in 2004, distributed a news
release yesterday saying that "Davis is emerging as a national spokesman for
the Democrats on energy issues."
The governor yesterday appointed two members of former Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore's campaign, Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane, as
interim communication consultants. He named Gore's former deputy chief of
staff, Nancy McFadden, as senior adviser.
The governor will give the Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address
today.
While Davis blames the Lone Star State, none of Pacific Gas and Electric's
power plants, which produce 7,400 megawatts, was sold to Texas firms. They
were sold to Duke of North Carolina, Mirant of Georgia, and Calpine of
California.
The biggest purchaser of Southern California Edison power plants was AES
Corp. of Virginia, which obtained 4,706 megawatts. Reliant, a Texas firm,
bought plants from Edison that can produce 4,000 megawatts.
Destec of Houston and NRG Energy of Minneapolis purchased two Edison plants
with an output of 1,583 megawatts. Dynegy of Houston and NRG Energy purchased
plants producing 1,347 megawatts from San Diego Gas and Electric.
Davis has said in nationally televised interviews that there is an historic
transfer of wealth from California to Houston. A large electricity marketing
firm with close ties to Bush, Enron, also is based in Houston.
But Davis has focused much of his criticism on Reliant, whose profits soared
last year. Reliant openly rejected Davis' call last week for generators to
accept a 30 percent reduction in the debt they are owed by California
utilities.
Reliant also was the only generator that appealed a federal court order to
provide emergency power to California. Davis began singling out Reliant after
it charged the state $1,900 per megawatt hour for emergency power needed by
the California grid.
Reliant's president, Joe Bob Perkins, said in a teleconference with
California reporters yesterday that Reliant charged the high price because it
did not want to run a small reserve plant that can only be used for a limited
number of days.
The state of California, which has spent about $7 billion buying power for
utility customers since January, made emergency purchases of 336 megawatt
hours from Reliant on May 9 and 10, paying $1,900 per megawatt hour for a
total of $638,400.
In Texas, the Public Utilities Commission adopted a $1,000 per megawatt hour
cap on bids to supply emergency power as a "circuit-breaker" in case prices
somehow skyrocketed after Texas deregulates next year.
"I realize that amount has been reached in California," said Terry Hadley, a
spokesman for the Texas PUC. "Nothing close to that has been reached in
Texas."
Hadley said the most paid for emergency power by the Texas grid operator was
$500 per megawatt hour in 1999. He said the average price is $47 to $48 per
megawatt hour.
Texas has a surplus of power, unlike California, which has to import about 20
percent of its power. Texas also has a self-contained power grid that covers
about 85 percent of the state, including Houston, Dallas, San Antonio, and
Austin. California is part of a sprawling Western power grid.
Davis and others have been pushing for wholesale price caps on power in the
West. The Texas PUC rejected price caps and adopted a high bid cap as a
fail-safe, saying that would still allow prices to signal whether new power
plants are needed.
The governor yesterday also appointed a new energy adviser, Kellan Fluckiger,
who is on loan from the Independent System Operator, which operates the
California power grid.






Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation



ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
LOS ANGELES ) The head of the California Public Utilities Commission provided
a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduced
electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.
While testifying before the committee Friday, PUC President Loretta Lynch
displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at
three plants on a single day last November.
According to the graphs, after the plants reduced production during the
middle of the day, the state was forced to declare two separate power
emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low.
After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices, the companies
operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to
almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates.
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which is
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and
playing, to an extent, California."
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said.
She would not identify the power plants involved, however, Lynch did say that
they are owned by at least two companies.
Sen. Joseph Dunn, who heads the special committee investigating alleged
market manipulation, said Lynch's testimony, on its face, is "very damning."
He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing
that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior.
During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of major
power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no
coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits.
"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy
Producers Association.
The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and
brought major utilities to financial ruin





California economy braces for $5.7 billion electric rate hike



By Michael Liedtke
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) Higher power costs zapped restauranteur Marino Sandoval and
his customers even before California regulators decided this week how to
allocate a $5.7 billion electricity rate hike ) the highest in the state's
history.
Faced with soaring natural gas rates that tripled his utility bill, Sandoval
last month raised the prices at his popular Mexican restaurant chain, El
Balazo, by as much as 20 percent on some items. A giant burrito that cost
$4.95 at the end of March costs $5.95 Saturday.
"We had to do it because it seemed like the price of everything, from our
beans to our tortillas, was going up almost every day. Our higher prices have
everything to do with the higher energy prices," said Sandoval, who runs six
restaurants in San Francisco and the East Bay.
From hotels to bagel shops, businesses throughout California have been
raising their prices or imposing special surcharges to offset rising power
costs. Most of the increases so far have reflected higher natural gas costs,
which utilities have been passing along to their customers throughout the
state's power crisis.
Now, businesses and households are bracing for electricity rate increases
that could balloon the bills of the largest users of the state's two biggest
utilities, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison Co.
The higher rates, which will begin appearing in June's utility bills,
threaten to jolt the state's already jittery economy.
"Pretty soon, we may see California staring down the barrel of a recession,"
said Dave Puglia, a vice president for APCO, a public affairs firm hired by
California business interests to study the economic effect of the state's
energy woes.
Until now, California businesses have only had to pay a fraction of the
state's staggering electricity bill, which is on a pace to reach $70 billion
this year ) about 10 times more than in 1999.
By itself, the $5.7 billion rate increase approved by the California Public
Utilities Commission probably isn't enough to topple the state's roughly $1
trillion economy ) the sixth largest in the world.
"It will cause some hardships, particularly for some small business owners,
but from the macro point of view, these rate increases aren't going to have a
major impact on California's output," predicted Sung Won Sohn, chief
economist for Wells Fargo & Co., which runs the biggest bank headquartered in
the state.
But some business leaders are worried the hike will represent the coup de
grace for many companies already reeling from rising expenses for gasoline,
natural gas, health care benefits and workers' compensation insurance.
Against this backdrop, many employers also face pressure to raise their
workers' wages to help pay for California's high housing costs.
"If this keeps up, at some point, we are going to reach a breaking point in
the economy," said Allan Zaremberg, president of the California Chamber of
Commerce.
The California Chamber is part of the California Alliance for Energy and
Economic Stability, a coalition that sought to shift more of the electricity
rate increase from businesses to households.
Under the plan approved by the PUC, businesses are expected to pay about $4.6
billion more for electricity and households will pay an additional $1.1
billion.
Even if they are spared on their utility bills, consumers still will be
pinched by higher prices for goods and services as businesses pass along
their electricity price increases.
Some California firms, particularly those making commodities sold around the
world, won't be able to substantially raise their prices without losing
business from customers who will buy from competitors in other states and
countries.
Manufacturers of cement, glass, paper products and steel are among the
companies that probably won't be able to pass along their higher energy
costs, Puglia said.
The rate increases mean that utility bills will consume about 25 percent to
30 percent of a big manufacturer's budget, Puglia estimated, up from about 15
percent now.
"I wouldn't be surprised if we see some companies go out of business because
of this," said Justin Bradley, director of energy programs for the Silicon
Valley Manufacturing Association, a high-tech trade group.
Even if they don't shut down completely, many companies likely will lay off
workers as they cut costs to pay for power. The California Manufacturers and
Technology Association estimates that the energy crisis will result in the
loss of 135,755 jobs ) or about 40,000 more than the entire dot-com industry
has laid off nationwide during the past 16 months.
Painful though they may be, higher electricity rates and some resulting
layoffs are a better alternative than the increased number of blackouts that
probably would have occurred if retail prices hadn't been raised, according
to most economists.
"People are wildly exaggerating how much this is going to hurt the California
economy," said Stephen Levy, director of the Center for Continuing Study of
the California Economy, a Palo Alto research firm. "The rate increases are
part of a long-term solution for California. We needed them to stabilize the
market. On balance, this is a good thing."
Even though his monthly utility bill at one of his restaurants rose from
$1,500 last year to $4,500 this year, El Balazo's Sandoval shares Levy's
optimism. After all, customers continue to pour into his restaurants, despite
his restaurant's higher menu prices.
"Business is so good that I have been too busy to think about whether I am
going to have to raise my prices again," he said. "If I have to, I will. I
don't think people are going to stop eating because of this."





Price information sought from natural gas companies



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
WASHINGTON ) A federal regulatory agency late Friday directed natural gas
companies selling in California to provide detailed information for better
investigations of possible price gouging and market abuses.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said it viewed the unusually high
prices of wholesale natural gas in California as "a matter of serious
concern" but didn't have enough information to determine if they are illegal.
It noted that the spot price of natural gas charged at the California border
has been exceedingly high since December when it ranged between $11.79 and
$18.80 per thousand cubic feet, compared to $4 to $7 elsewhere in the county.
The most recent prices at the California border exceed $9, more than twice
the wholesale price in other parts of the country. Such a disparity over such
a long period of time would not be expected in a competitive market, the
agency said.
California officials have argued for months that FERC should intervene and
more aggressively investigate high natural gas prices, which have been a
major cause of some of the run-up in electricity costs in the state. Many of
the state's power plants run on natural gas.
The order asks for a wide range of information at the end of each calendar
quarter including volumes of gas sold, prices, transportation rates, daily
operational pipeline capacity and volumes flowing in and out of the state.
Allegations of price gouging and market manipulation have been at the center
of a hearing by a FERC administrative law judge all this week. The hearing
will continue next week.
The case involves a major natural gas pipeline owned by the Houston-based El
Paso Corp., which supplies Southern California.
California regulators, and two of the states financially troubled utilities,
filed a formal complaint with FERC, alleging that manipulation by two El Paso
subsidiaries ) one a gas marketer and the other an operator of the pipeline )
led to $3.7 billion in natural gas overcharges since March 2000.
El Paso Corp. has strongly denied the allegation.
For the past week, attorneys for El Paso have questioned witnesses from the
California Public Utilities Commission in an attempt to disprove the charges.
The witnesses admitted they failed to consider some additional factors that
could have affected prices in their analyses, but they did not back away from
their conclusion.
In support of their argument, California officials have provided internal El
Paso memos ) which have not been disclosed publicly ) that allegedly discuss
market control in connection with gas flowing through the pipeline.
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner has said the documents contain
statements "that could lead one to believe there was an abuse" of pipeline
capacity. He is not expected to make a ruling on the case until later this
summer. A final decision on what action to take, if any, would be up to the
full commission.






Davis Sharpens Attack on Bush Energy Plan
Power: He also hires high-profile consultants in effort to boost his
political standing.

By DAN MORAIN and MARK Z. BARABAK, Times Staff Writers


SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis is going on the attack as the Democratic
Party's point man against President Bush's energy plan, even as he seeks to
bolster his drooping standing in California by hiring consultants who honed
their crisis-management skills during the scandal-ridden Clinton
administration.
Davis was expected to again criticize Bush's energy plan today as he
makes the official Democratic response to Bush's weekly radio address.
In the last week, Davis has variously blasted the president's energy
plan and Texas energy companies on an ABC talk show, on CNN, and in an
opinion piece for the Washington Post. In an interview with Associated Press,
Davis vowed to "hold everyone accountable: myself, the energy producers and
the president of the United States."
"We are literally in a war with energy companies who are price gouging
us," Davis said Friday. "Many of those companies are in Texas. Mr. President,
you didn't create this problem, but you are the only one who can solve it."
At the same time, Davis all but acknowledged his own political problems
when he announced that he has retained two political aides, Mark Fabiani and
Chris Lehane. The two, who also do work for Southern California Edison, will
be paid by taxpayers at a combined rate of $30,000 per month--more than the
$13,750 earned by the governor himself.
Lehane, known for his tart-tongued commentary, was Vice President Al
Gore's main campaign spokesman, and had a knack for getting under Bush's skin
during the 2000 campaign.
Fabiani, a Harvard law school graduate, became a highly partisan and
acerbic White House defender when President Clinton was mired in
investigations ranging from the Whitewater land deal to the Monica Lewinsky
affair. Fabiani developed his reputation for being able to handle crises
while defending Mayor Tom Bradley against various investigations near the end
of the late mayor's tenure.
In political circles, the nickname of their firm is Masters of Disaster.
Davis' decision to retain Lehane and Fabiani comes as the governor's
once-sterling poll numbers have fallen sharply and he faces persistent
criticism over his handling of the energy crisis.
Their arrival also corresponds to Davis' increasingly aggressive stand
on the energy crisis. In recent days, Davis for the first time has attacked
an individual generator, Reliant Energy of Houston, for charging a record
$1,900 per megawatt for electricity on two days last week. He also dared
President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney to "stand up" to their
"friends" in the energy business by capping wholesale electricity prices
charged in California.
Davis' more assertive stance comes as Democrats nationwide step up their
attacks on the president, using the energy plan to launch a broader assault
on Bush's leadership and policies.
"One of the glaring flaws in the Bush energy plan is that it offers no
short-term relief for consumers," said Dan Pfeiffer, a spokesman for the
Democratic Governors Assn., which Davis chairs. "And there is no better
example of that than the fact he does nothing to control runaway prices in
California."
In addition to portraying Bush as ignoring the plight of California--the
nation's largest electoral prize--Democrats see Bush's energy response as a
way of confirming their broader assertion that he is captive to oil interests.
"This is a way for us to show how they are really an administration and
a party that is bought and paid for by special interests," said Jenny Backus,
a spokeswoman for the Democratic National Committee.
To press the case, the party has created a snide Web
site--www.grandoldpetroleum--and will soon start running TV ads attacking GOP
lawmakers over the energy issue, including in California.
Paul Maslin, the governor's pollster, said Davis had given the president
a grace period after he took office in January to see how Bush would address
the energy problem. But the governor grew increasingly frustrated when it
became clear "we weren't going to get any help from Washington."
For his part, Bush made glancing reference to California in a speech
Friday at a hydroelectric plant in Pennsylvania, part of his tour to sell the
administration's energy blueprint. The president praised Californians for
doing "a fantastic job in conservation."
"And yet they're lacking energy. They're having blackouts," Bush said.
"We all must be deeply concerned about our fellow citizens in the great state
of California. But the problems in California show that you cannot conserve
your way to energy independence."
While Bush did not mention the governor, the president's deputies have
rushed to criticize him.
Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, head of the Republican National Committee,
suggested Davis was hypocritical to attack Bush when "the president is the
one who came forward with the first energy plan we've seen in years."
"He's going to have to answer the question of what he's done as
governor," Gilmore said. "While he's in the process of attacking, one might
suspect he may be diverting attention away from his own record."
On Thursday, Environmental Protection Agency administrator Christine
Todd Whitman was overheard criticizing Davis to Iowa Republican Party
official Darrell Kearney.
"He's had plenty of time to do something, and he hasn't done anything,"
she said as she left a meeting room in Nevada, Iowa, where Bush had just
finished speaking.
Some more independent observers see political liabilities in the Bush
plan, namely the focus on long-term solutions at a time voters are growing
increasingly upset about high gas prices and soaring utility bills.
"While [the administration] talks about how we approach things in the
next five years, there's not a lot of empathy or understanding for what's
affecting people now," said Stuart Rothenberg, a nonpartisan political
analyst in Washington.
"Maybe it's unfair to talk about Bush and Cheney's oil backgrounds and
Texas backgrounds," Rothenberg said. "But it's an obvious thing for critics
to do."
Rothenberg predicted a backlash that could cost Republicans control of
Congress next year, "if the energy issue continues to grow and Americans
really become concerned. . . . It puts the burden on the White House and
Republicans to change that."
Davis' new aides, while considered expert in solving the kind of
political crisis threatening Davis, pose the potential of controversy on
their own.
As consultants, Lehane and Fabiani, unlike government officials, are not
required to file conflict of interest statements detailing their holdings and
sources of income.
However, in an interview on Friday, Lehane acknowledged that he and
Fabiani have worked for about two months as consultants for Southern
California Edison. He insisted there is no conflict.
Davis is struggling to win legislative approval of a deal he struck with
Edison to rescue the utility from bankruptcy. Several lawmakers oppose the
deal, contending that it is too rich for Edison.
"Both sides [Edison and Davis] are in agreement on what needs to be done
here," Lehane said. "As the governor said . . . we are literally in a war
with these out-of-state generators."
Although Lehane and Fabiani will be working on broader communications
issues for Davis, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union, a critic of the
Davis-Edison deal, blasted Davis' decision to hire consultants who also work
for the utility.
"Davis has done everything politically wrong," Snyder said. "He hasn't
done anything that is consistent with the democratic process. It is the worst
abuse of power that I have seen in 25 years of lobbying."
Others suggested that Davis was helping himself by bringing the duo
aboard.
"Mark is the premier crisis manager in the country in terms of
communication strategy," Democratic political consultant Bill Carrick said.
"He has tremendous experience. . . . He takes the incoming. You get hit with
something in the morning. He knows how to turn it around by the afternoon."
Lehane said the governor's decision to hire them does not suggest Davis
will become more pugnacious, although he added that Davis is "not someone
afraid to pick a fight when someone, like the out-of-state generators,
represent policies that are bad for the people of California."
"Gov. Davis has been very successful in politics for quite some time in
this state," Lehane said. "He has a keen understanding of how this state
works and how politics in this state works. I don't think his style is going
to change or be any different than he has been throughout his career."

PUC Allegations Detailed
Hearing: The commission president tells a Senate panel that maintenance
records show no valid reason for generators to cut power production.

By ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers


The head of the California Public Utilities Commission Friday provided
fresh details showing that power generators scaled back electricity
production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.
In sworn testimony before a state Senate committee, PUC President
Loretta Lynch said the companies' behavior helped drain so much electricity
from the state's grid that officials were forced to declare emergency alerts.
Lynch's testimony followed her comments Thursday to The Times that state
investigators have found evidence of power plants being shut down
unnecessarily to create "artificial shortages," often when the state was most
desperate for electricity.
During her testimony Friday, Lynch went beyond her assertions about
unnecessary plant shutdowns and accused generators of also needlessly
throttling back generation.
The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and
brought major utilities to financial ruin.
Generators have said they never engaged in any conduct intended to
manipulate wholesale electricity prices, including unnecessarily shutting
down their plants or reducing supply. The facilities, theysay, are aging and
have run so hard during the state's crisis that they often require extensive
maintenance.
But the details released by Friday by Lynch added to the questions
surrounding the generators' activities.
Lynch displayed charts that track electricity prices and power
generation at three plants on a single day last November. After the plants
reduced production during the middle of the day, the graphs show, the state
was forced to declare two separate power emergencies because electricity
reserves had fallen seriously low.
The shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices. With that, the
companies operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity
production to almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much
higher rates.
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which
isinvestigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and
playing, to an extent, California."
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no
valid reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said. She declined
to identify the power plants involved, saying only that they are owned by at
least two companies.
Sen. Joseph Dunn (D-Santa Ana), who heads the special committee
investigating alleged market manipulation, said Lynch's information, on its
face, is "very damning."
He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence
showing that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar
behavior.
"We are looking at data that is suspicious," Dunn said.
During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of
major power suppliers said there have been no coordinated efforts to shrink
supplies to increase profits.
"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy
Producers Assn.
She said many of the plants bought by out-of-state generators under
California's flawed deregulation plan are more than 30 years old. The plants
have been running at high levels to help the state with its energy crunch,
she said.
Muoz told reporters that the plants owned by out-of-state companies
last year produced 60% more electricity than the previous year.
Although no firm has been singled out by the PUC or the attorney
general's office, Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. said inspectors have visited
company plants more than 100 times this year and have found no wrongdoing.
"Mirant has run its plants voluntarily and continually throughout the
crisis," the company said in a statement Friday.
But Lynch said Friday that visits to more than 80 plants by PUC
investigators since December show that generators are not always producing
all the power they can.
"It appears that there have been numerous instances within the past
half-year where generation units were not producing the amount of electricity
that they were capable of producing," Lynch said.

Utility Exec Rejects the Governor's Criticism
Power: Leader of Reliant Energy defends policies and says Davis' rhetoric
could harm California.

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer


SACRAMENTO--The top executive of a Houston-based energy company singled
out for criticism this week by Gov. Gray Davis defended his company Friday
and warned that the governor's rhetoric will ultimately hurt California.
"On Wednesday we were called obstructionist," said Joe Bob Perkins,
chief executive of Reliant Energy, which bought five Southern California
power plants when the state launched deregulation in 1998.
"I don't think it's obstructionist to supply record amounts of power
from old plants in order to keep the lights on," Perkins said. "I don't think
it's obstructionist to invest more than $80 million in 2000 alone to upgrade
the plants and reduce emission levels. I don't think it's obstructionist to
continue to run our facilities at times when there's been no guarantee of
payment."
In a telephone conference call with reporters, Perkins said, "California
officials must lessen the rhetoric and focus on efforts to mitigate the
impacts of summer blackouts."
Perkins said threats of windfall profits taxes and plant seizures could
scare off substantial business from California.
For months, Davis has disparaged private power plant owners in
California as gougers and profiteers, but until last week he did not single
out individual companies.
Last Thursday, after state power buyers paid an extraordinary $1,900 per
megawatt-hour, Davis broke the confidentiality he had maintained on state
power purchases and named Reliant as the seller.
Reliant has sued to get out of its obligation to sell power to the state
and refused to discuss forgiving some portion of the $307 million it is owed
by California utilities.
"They're one of only a couple of generators that say absolutely no way,
no how are they going to negotiate for anything less than 100%," Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio said after the Reliant executive's remarks.
The governor's recent attack has made some Reliant officials wonder if
he is building a case to seize control of its power plants. Davis has
threatened to commandeer plants to bring down wholesale power costs.
Perkins said his company set a high price last week to discourage the
state from buying the power, which was produced at a small, inefficient plant
near Santa Barbara that cannot run more than nine days a year because of air
pollution regulations.
Reliant officials said they wanted to reserve the plant for use later
this summer.
Maviglio said Reliant's argument "defies logic."
"When you make a bid . . . you want somebody to buy the power."

PUC Chief Alleges Price Collusion
Power: She cites evidence that plants were shut down to create "artificial
shortages." An industry spokesman calls the accusation "idiocy."

By RICH CONNELL and ROBERT LOPEZ, Times Staff Writers

State investigators have uncovered evidence that a "cartel" of power
companies shut down plants for unnecessary maintenance to ratchet up prices,
the head of the California Public Utilities Commission asserted Thursday.
PUC President Loretta Lynch said her agency, working with the state
attorney general's office, is probing patterns of plant outages that have
created "artificial shortages," particularly when the state has issued
emergency alerts because of seriously low levels of electricity.
"There are instances where plants could have produced, and they chose
not to," Lynch said in an interview at The Times.
"And it is clear that there are instances that plants, when called to
produce, chose not to produce," even when they were obligated to do so under
special contracts with the state and utility companies.
Lynch said the ongoing investigation has already produced enough
information for the PUC and attorney general's office to take legal action
against the generators next month. The exact nature of that action, she said,
is still under review.
Lynch, who is an attorney, did not name specific suppliers or provide
documentation of her assertions. She said that information will remain
confidential until court proceedings are undertaken.
Generators have long denied any attempt at manipulating the power market
in any unlawful way, including orchestrating plant shutdowns. They say the
facilities are so old and have been run so hard during the power crisis that
breakdowns are a recurring problem.
Lynch and Gov. Gray Davis, who has been particularly critical of
out-of-state generators, have not suggested that every plant shutdown has
been unwarranted.
In fact, the governor's top advisor on power plants released a statement
last week saying inspectors determined that a Bay Area plant shutdown was
justified and that the company's officials were "accommodating."
State Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer was not available for comment on his joint
investigation with the PUC. A spokesman would only confirm that Lockyer's
office is investigating plant shutdowns as part of a wide-ranging probe of
possible civil and criminal violations.
So far, the attorney general's office has subpoenaed documents in 91
categories from generators, including records of plant operations, pricing
practices and information the merchants may have shared with one another
about California's power market.
"We're looking for behavior that would violate antitrust or unfair
business practice laws," Lockyer has told The Times.
Although he has not provided details of his office's findings, he
recently said the inquiry is "beginning to get interesting."
Lynch said evidence of allegedly unnecessary plant shutdowns was amassed
during interviews by investigators and in a review of the voluminous
subpoenaed records, obtained after intense legal battles with the power
companies.
In addition, investigators have been entering plants where unplanned
shutdowns have occurred to examine operations and maintenance records, Lynch
said. At times, the investigators have been denied access and have had to
exert legal pressure to get in, she said.
The plant shutdowns are a key factor in the soaring power prices, which
have gone from $200 a megawatt-hour in December to as high as $1,900 last
week.
"I would argue it's no accident," Lynch said of the high prices. "That
in fact it's [due to] the coordinated behavior of a cartel."
The power generators have repeatedly said they have acted within the
rules of California's flawed deregulation program, which allowed them to buy
power plants formerly run by the state's three largest utilities.
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for a trade association of large power
producers, said Lynch's allegations were "the height of idiocy."
The reason many plants have been down in recent months, he said, is that
power producers must perform maintenance now in anticipation of heavy summer
demand.
He said he doubted that state investigators could prove wrongdoing
because there was no conspiracy to turn off supplies.
"My members do not make money by shutting down their plants so their
competitors can make money," said Ackerman, executive director of the Western
Power Trading Forum.
State analysts have argued, however, that power traders can reap
extraordinary profits by withholding power because the prices for the power
that is sold are so high.
According to Lynch, investigators have found that some companies were
more aggressive than others in allegedly using plant shutdowns to manipulate
the state's power market.
She said investigators have also found a suspicious pattern: When
operators of the state electricity grid declare a Stage 1 alert--meaning that
electricity reserves have dropped below 7%--plants that do not need repairs
suddenly are yanked offline. That, she said, aggravates the shortages, and
the cost of wholesale electricity soars.
Before December, state analysts alleged that power traders had driven up
prices primarily through bidding. At the time, the market was designed to pay
all power suppliers the highest amount accepted by the state's grid operator.
That changed in December, when new federal regulations restructured
California's wholesale power market to loosen price controls, Lynch said.
Since then, a new pattern of plant shutdowns has emerged--"not coincidentally
in my view," she said. Now, she added, the state has endured "historically
high levels of unplanned plant outages."
The investigation is not focusing on power plants still operated by
utility companies because they have not been "going off [line] at record
levels," Lynch said.
The California Energy Commission reported last week that the state's
electrical grid has been sorely tested by plant shutdowns at a rate several
times higher than in the last two years.
A Times analysis of state data found that, throughout the last two
months, about 12,000 megawatts of production was offline, more than a third
of the peak power used in California on a typical day. That has been about
evenly divided between scheduled and sudden plant shutdowns.
By contrast, shutdowns in the same period of 1999 and 2000 took only
3,300 to 5,700 megawatts offline.
Last month, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission ordered electricity
supplier Williams Energy Marketing and Trading to pay $8 million in
connection with allegations that plants were improperly shut down to raise
prices. The company agreed to settle the case without admitting any
wrongdoing.
However, FERC released a study in February of closures at three other
California plants that it concluded were not undertaken to create a scarcity
of power.
After talking to plant operators by telephone, reviewing documents and
visiting the three plants, federal inspectors concluded that "the companies
appeared to have taken whatever steps were necessary to bring the generating
facilities back online as soon as possible by accelerating maintenance and
incurring additional expenses."

Critics Say Bush Proposal Leaves California in the Dark
Effect: President's energy plan may not even offer a silver lining for the
power-deprived Golden State.

By JENIFER WARREN and ROBIN FIELDS, Times Staff Writers

California lawmakers, analysts and others waist-deep in the state's
power crisis reached a single conclusion Thursday about the White House
energy plan:
By the time many of President Bush's proposals kick in, it will be too
late to do the Golden State much good.
"This plan does absolutely nothing to help California get through the
next critical 18 months," groused state Sen. Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey).
"You can't focus just on the long term here. Because the patient will be dead
before we get the life-support systems in place."
Gov. Gray Davis and others say the single best step Bush could take to
help the state is to impose controls on runaway electricity prices that are
draining California's treasury and forcing massive utility rate increases.
Instead, the president has offered an energy blueprint anchored by an
expansion in drilling for natural gas and oil, increased reliance on nuclear
power and more than $10 billion in tax credits for conservation and energy
development.
Most of Bush's proposals, however, are slow-acting remedies, and many
others already are being applied in California, which was hit by energy woes
far ahead of other states.
The plan's dozens of incentive programs designed to boost output or
promote conservation cannot be ramped up in time to protect the state from
blackouts and painful spikes in electricity prices, experts say.
"Overall, the message in this plan is, 'Drop dead, California,' " said
Eric Heitz of the Energy Foundation, a San Francisco-based research and
advocacy group.
"I don't think it delivers another megawatt to California," added
Loretta Lynch, president of the California Public Utilities Commission.
State economic analysts say the plan fails California by viewing the
power crisis as an ongoing emergency, rather than a temporary one.
California's supply crunch should ease dramatically by summer 2003, once 27
new power plants--15 of them licensed, 12 in the pipeline--start churning.
"It's not that we don't have long-term problems," said Stephen Levy,
director of the Palo Alto-based Center for Continuing Study of the California
Economy. "It's just that energy isn't among them."
Others, including many environmentalists, say Bush could have made a
noticeable impact by, for example, beefing up energy efficiency programs--a
quick, clean and relatively inexpensive way to cut demand.
"Why not provide aggressive incentives [rebates] to get people to
purchase more efficient air conditioners?" asked Dan Reicher, assistant
Energy secretary in the Clinton administration. "Over the course of the year,
a program like that can make a dramatic difference" because air conditioning
consumes nearly one-third of California's peak energy supply.
Instead, Reicher noted, Bush earlier this year rolled back efficiency
standards for air conditioners, a move that critics say will require the
country to build 43 new power plants.
Even the few elements of the plan that looked promising for California
were clouded by doubt.
Bush, for example, directed the Energy secretary to explore ways to
relieve a key transmission bottleneck, known as "Path 15," between Northern
and Southern California. But he specified that the upgrade, which requires
building a 90-mile line at an estimated cost of $225 million, be funded by
"nonfederal contributions"--meaning the financially strapped utilities might
be expected to bear the cost.
Gov. Davis, who lately has stepped up his pleas for help from
Washington, said the Bush plan offers too little too late for California and
criticized the president for allowing "the price-gouging energy companies,
many of which reside in Texas, to get away with murder."
Davis said the state is "doing everything possible to build and conserve
our way out of the problem," but it desperately needs federal price controls
on energy costs. In 1999, California energy users spent about $7 billion;
this year, even with consumption down 5%, the bill could top $50 billion.
But Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney, who led the task force that
prepared the plan, are opposed to price caps, preferring to let market forces
reign.
Davis said that laissez faire approach puts California's economy in
peril.
"Just saying, over the long haul, everything will work out is turning a
blind eye to the bleeding and hemorrhaging that exist in this state," Davis
said. "Small businesses . . . literally will go out of business because they
can't afford these rates."
Analysts who studied the Bush plan say they are particularly
disappointed because it covers a lot of ground already plowed by California.
Bush recommends building 1,900 power plants over the next 20
years--about eight plants a month. But California is already on a
plant-building spree that will give it a comfortable supply within two years.
The president also wants to streamline approval of plants and is pushing
for a renewed commitment to nuclear power. The California governor, however,
has already ordered expedited licensing of new plants under an executive
order issued in February.
There is little evidence, meanwhile, that Californians are eager to
approve an expansion in nuclear power. Nationwide, not one new nuclear plant
has been licensed in more than 20 years. And a Times Poll in February found
that 60% of Californians oppose more nuclear reactors in the state.
"You can barely build clean-burning gas plants here, let alone nuclear
plants," said Edward Kahn, a San Francisco-based energy consultant with
Analysis Group/Economics.
Among other elements of the plan that could affect California is a
proposal to allow federal authorities to take private land for power lines.
Currently, the U.S. government's power to forcibly acquire private property
applies only to highways and gas pipelines. Expanding that power is likely to
enrage property owners and property-rights advocates, who typically expect
backing from Bush-style conservatives.
"I'm just surprised that this administration would want to preempt the
state's [authority] over its own land," said Lynch of the PUC.
The issue is already heated in California. Communities in southwestern
Riverside County have mobilized to resist San Diego Gas & Electric's attempts
to use eminent domain to obtain private land for 31 miles of transmission
lines. The Legislature is considering a bill that would require state energy
officials and utilities to grab public land first before reaching for private
acreage.
Bush also proposed a unified, private national electricity grid, an idea
that seems at odds with Southern California Edison's effort to sell its
transmission lines to the state. But Edison officials said they hope to have
their deal worked out long before the president's idea comes to fruition--if
it ever does.
Unveiling his energy program in St. Paul, Minn., Bush said he is "deeply
concerned about the impact of blackouts on the daily lives of the good people
of the state of California."
But S. Davis Freeman, the former Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power chief who is now the governor's energy advisor, said Bush has let down
the state by failing to "answer the 911 call."
"It's like your house is on fire," Freeman said. "You call the fire
department, and they say, 'No, we're not coming, but we're building a
super-duper firetruck that will be ready five years from now.' "

Wall St. Cautious Over Energy Sector's Outlook for Next Year
Stocks: Earnings for many oil and natural gas producers are expected to top
out in 2001 as prices stabilize.

By JOSH FRIEDMAN and TOM PETRUNO, Times Staff Writers

President Bush's energy plan, unveiled Thursday, helped spark a broad
rally across the energy sector and among firms that stand to benefit by
selling equipment and services to oil and natural gas companies.
Yet Wall Street has been taking a cautious stance toward energy shares
in recent months, and Thursday's rally doesn't change much, some analysts and
money managers say.
Despite the long-term earnings boost the sector could get under Bush's
plan, many oil and gas companies are expected to post lower earnings in 2002
than in 2001, analysts estimate.
That reflects expectations that crude oil and natural gas prices will at
best stabilize at current levels--which are down sharply from their 2000
peaks--or head lower.
Thus, after heady gains in 1999 and 2000 as oil and gas prices rocketed,
many energy stocks have stalled this year.
The American Stock Exchange index of 15 major natural-gas-related
stocks, for example, is down 4% year to date. The Standard & Poor's index of
six large oil and gas exploration and production companies has lost 5.3%.
Schlumberger (ticker symbol: SLB), a leading oil-field services company,
has seen its shares pull back 15% since Jan. 1, even with a gain of $1.78 to
$67.99 on Thursday.
By contrast, the blue-chip S&P 500 index is down 2.4% this year.
Craig T. Callahan, manager of Icon Energy stock mutual fund and chief
investment officer at the Icon Funds group, said investors need to be choosy
to find good buys today in the energy sector.
"We're leaning more toward the refiners than the drillers because
they're the better bargains," he said. "And at this point the good news looks
fully priced into the services and equipment group."
After betting big on the energy sector in early-1999, Callahan took
profits earlier this year. "We just don't see energy as a leader anymore--its
leadership days are done," he said.
Callahan shrugged off any potential windfalls from Bush's proposal. "We
look at these companies from the bottom up and pretty much ignore the macro
trends," he said.
For the near term, investors have to cope with the prospect that
earnings at many energy companies will decline in 2002.
Chevron (CHV), for example, is expected to earn $7.20 a share this year,
according to analysts' consensus estimate as tracked by IBES/Thomson
Financial. But next year the company's earnings are expected to fall to $6.20.
At the stock's current price--it rose 41 cents to $95.66 Thursday--the
price-to-earnings ratio based on estimated 2002 results is 15. That is lower
than the average blue-chip stock P/E of 21, but experts note that energy
stocks generally have lower P/Es because of the inherently cyclical nature of
the business.
Still, some analysts believe the Bush energy plan could revive interest
in many energy shares, if investors take a longer-term view.
Companies that explore for, produce and refine oil and gas could be
among the biggest beneficiaries of Bush's initiatives, said Corey McElveen,
stock analyst at Morningstar Inc. In particular, he cites Phillips Petroleum
(P) and Exxon Mobil (XOM), which already have operations in energy-rich
Alaska. Phillips rose $1.72 to $65.87 on Thursday, while Exxon Mobil eased 77
cents to $88.73.
Callahan, however, favors companies that focus on refining. Ashland

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I have spoken this morning with Tom Ganucheau, Calpine's lawyer, and
confirmed that the depositions of Calpine witnesses are on for next week.
Tom is juggling schedules with the witnesses, and I told him we'd accomodate
their schedules, but I wanted him to give me a batting order by this Friday,
April 20, which he said he could do.

The following people are scheduled to be deposed: Carey Jordan, Steve Snow,
Paul Posoli, and Darryl Hayslip. Mr. Jordan will double as the CPSC
corporate rep, and I told Tom I had no problem taking his deposition once
and agreeing that it covered both his individual notice and the corporate
rep notice. Tom is still working on who will be named as the Calpine Corp.
corporate rep, and will advise us.

It will be very helpful if either Elizabeth or Ed can be present for at
least part of these depositions, especially Snow and Jordan.  At a minimum,
please jot down (or reply email) your thoughts as to any points you want to
be sure we cover with these witnesses.  Cross examination of an adverse
witness in circumstances like this is much more effective when the Enron rep
knowledgable about the transaction is in the room, both to deter
exaggeration from the witness, and to serve as a resource for following up
on incorrect or evasive answers.

The summary judgment reply is due this Friday and will be filed on time. A
current draft was circulated yesterday evening to Bonnie and to Andy, along
with the current draft affidavits for Sager, Baughman, Bradford and Vollmar.
Sager's affidavit is signed and has been returned to me. Baughman called
yesterday with revisions and Bradford called this morning; we are still
waiting on the damage information to fill in the last paragraph of
Baughman's affidavit.

Please let me know if any of you need current copies of the brief or any
affidavits, and please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or
comments.

Best regards,

Chris,

E hired Tony to support Global Markets but Jeff Shankman decided that, given
highly specialized nature of his work it makes sense to put him in the
Research Group, with a dotted line to Mike Roberts who is running our weather

Given that his work will directly and exclusively benefit GM, it makes sense
for Research to charge his expenses
to Global Markets. We can adjust allocations to reflect his contributions to
different sub-units of GM.

Tony spent the last few weeks in Houston training for his position in London
with Mike Roberts.
We are very excited about the prospect of working with him.

I have not received any response from Lou Pai.  Is he still with Enron?  I did not get a return receipt from the e-mails I have sent to him.

Do you have anyone else that may be interested in looking at this potential gas fueled auto technology that these entrepreneurs have?

The reason why I contact you again on this is that the folks that wish to submit the unsolicited proposal to Enron called me again asking if we are interested.

Sorry to bother you with this again, but if there is anyone else I can contact I would appreciate it.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


(I had type of bunch of this and them my computer died, so I have to rewrite
it - UGH)
Harry's testimony was brilliant, and here is a summary.
Harry explained our proposal and how it achieves goals of equity and
conservation  (equity because all customers sacrifice equally and
conservation because there will be reductions in usage).  The other proposals
in the case arbitrarily allocate costs to peak, whereas our proposal will
have customers reacting to price signals, and if affords flexibility.  The
Hearing Examiner (HE) asked what services EES provides, and whether our
customers were DA customers (she was trying to get to our real interest in
this case, which the PG&E attorney helped with later).
Slocum (PG&E) did not understand that our proposal was only for TOU
customerrs and asked a lot of questions about implementation problems that
were based on implementation for all classes.(Questions like moving usage
data to billing system, 30% turnover in customers, lack of data for new
customers, lack of metering).  Harry acknowledged that the peak defined by DJ
might not match the rate class peak definition and that some adjustments
might have to be made.  Slocum noted that TOU meters do not show hourly
usage, and that hourly interval meters would need to be installed to make our
proposal work.  Harry answered that we recognize that our proposal would take
time, but that we need to move to this and that customers need price signals
this summer.
Our proposal is only for TOU customers, and for those for whom it cannot be
implemented, an equal 3 cents per kwh is appropriate.  Harry noted that we
have not taken a position on the proposal that should be adopted for other
customer classes yet.
He was asked where the 87% came from, ands he pointed out the derivation that
was in his testimony based on predicted market price and cost of retained
generation.  Two assumptions were made:  a $300 average market price and
customers have same billing determinants for 2001 in combination with market
price assumptions and existing generation rate to get the revenue
requirements.  It is possible that the price may not be $300 and our revenue
requirements may be off, but this is true with every other proposal  as
well.  The basis for the $300 is the COB and PV Nymex contracts.
If our proposal cannot be implemented this summer, the 3 cent charge sends an
adequate and strong signal to consumers across the board.  When asked whether
PG&E would have to program a different method for TOU customers if Enron,s
proposal is adopted, Harry answered that they already have to program a
different method for TOU customers under existing rates.  PG&E asked how the
decremental reward program would be funded.  Harry noted that it could be
funded through the ISO, DWR, utility bonding.  The PG&E attorney noted that
the utilities have been downgraded to junk bond status and couldn,t issue
bonds.  Funding is an issue.
Then PG&E asked if we left the market on 2/1/01.  Harry answered no.  We
simply began sourcing power from the utility, but our contracts are still in
effect.  She asked Harry what kind of customers we had, were they mostly
large TOU customers?  Do they have interval meters?  She asked if we were on
the hook for the difference between the bundled rate and the contract rate.
Harry answered that he didn,t know on balance what impact our proposal would
have on our TOU customers.   Our proposal helps to foster the goals and
pursue the incentives to get to the needed solutions in CA.  He also noted
that all parties to this proceeding were proposing methodologies that were
most beneficial to them.
SC&E asked a bunch of questions about recovery of T&D costs, if the 87%
target were used.  Harry answered that any undercollections that may result
(and this could be true under any of the proposals) could be dealt with it a
rate case filing.  They also talked about how the customer would know the
daily prices, would the utility be obligated to make that info available?  HK
answered that it is forecast a day ahead and is publicly available.  Then he
was asked whether Enron would fund the decremental reward program.  Harry
noted that we might under the right conditions, but this was outside his
expertise.
ORA asked about weather normalization, again under the misapprehension that
our proposal applied to weather sensitive smaller customers.  Harry also told
him that the indices we proposed were very liquid.  He also handled questions
on whether a different average price would yield a different break point, and
we need to provide calculations that show an average price of $200 and $500.
The Hearing Examiner then asked for Enron,s estimates of summer on peak and
off peak prices, and ruled that we must supply that info by COB Monday, over
counsel,s objections.
In general, I think there was a lot of confusion about our proposal (not
understanding that it was only directed to one type of customer).  There is
also a lot of distrust of Enron and I would add dislike as well.  I do not
think the HE will consider any of our proposals seriously and in fact our
support on some of the other proposals could be the kiss of death.  I would
keep our brief very short and very limited,  as we can weigh in on support of
the other A and RD methodologies after the HE issues her recommended
decision.  In fact, we might even like a proposal she recommends.

Larry phoned the plant and made sure that they were on board to keep us balanced and not overdeliver to,  or swing on, HPL.

2:00 pm - Phoned Lee in Gas Control to see how the pipeline was doing.  He indicated that we were pretty tight, but would probably make it without utilizing any OBA's.

Sunday - So. Union requested 15M beginning at 11:00 am. The pipeline was tight again, but Gas Control was okay.

I believe she is well suited for the new position in the Upstream Services group.

Please let me know if you have any additonal concerns, questions - Bob Superty

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


This is from my friend Jane in Texas - these phrases are pretty funny and I
am sure we can all incorporate them into our everyday conversations!



I am sending this only because I have actually heard several of these in
conversation over the years. Come to think of it, Jack may have used
some of these phrases.


Subject: Whitehouse Language

New language for the press corp and others at the
White House to get used to. The White House is not
just getting a new team, but a whole new language.
George W. Bush will be bringing with him many friends
from Texas, and for anyone not born in the Lone Star
State, the Texan accent and the cowboy colloquialisms
can seem a bit strange.

Here is a guide to a few of the more colorful
expressions they might encounter:

1. The engine's runnin' but ain't nobody driving = Not
overly-intelligent

2. As welcome as a skunk at a lawn party (self-explanatory)

3. Tighter than bark on a tree = Not very generous

4. Big hat, no cattle = All talk and no action

5. We've howdied but we ain't shook yet = We've made a
brief acquaintance, but not been formally introduced

6. He thinks the sun come up just to hear him crow =
He has a pretty high opinion of himself

7. She's got tongue enough for 10 rows of teeth = That
woman can talk

8. It's so dry the trees are bribin' the dogs = We
really could use a little rain around here

9. Just because a chicken has wings doesn't mean it
can fly = Appearances can be deceptive.

10. This ain't my first rodeo = I've been around
awhile.

11. He looks like the dog's been keepin' him under the
porch = Not the most handsome of men

12. They ate supper before they said grace = Living in sin

13. Time to paint your butt white and run with the
antelope = Stop arguing and do as you're told

14. As full of wind as a corn-eating horse = Rather
prone to boasting

15. You can put your boots in the oven, but that
doesn't make them biscuits = You can say whatever you
want about something, but that doesn't change what it is.

16. Yankees are kinda like hemorrhoids, they're not too
bad when they come down and go back up, but they're a
real pain in the butt when they come down and stay.

I just spoke with Clark Smith, head of Elpaso's merchant arm.  I told him
that we had been hearing that El Paso was blaming Enrononline for problems in
Western gas markets.  He asked for some more specifics about who exactly was
spreading the rumor (I told him we had heard it from 3-4 sources).  He
acknowledged that EOL was not the problem; said he couldn't believe that it
had been identified as such; and said he would bring it up on his call with
his Washington team this afternoon.

I think he will put it to rest (except for whatever damage has already been
done).  I did promise to get some more specifics on who has told us that El
Paso pointed to us.  Can anybody give some info on that?

One of my partners, David Schrader, was opposite Joe Dunn for four years in
litigation in Southern California.  He tells me that Joe's strength is his
presentation -- low key, sincere, effective in deposition, good with Judges.
However, he is not rated as being all that smart.  He still maintains an
office with Mark Robinson, a prominent heavy hitter plaintiffs' lawyer in
Southern California.  During this litigation, he was the coordinating
counsel for the plaintiffs in the breast implant litigation.  Thus, he is
very well connected to the plaintiffs bar and they probably funded part of
his campaign.  David believes that Dunn aspires to higher offices.

One other partner, Greg Williams, reports that he knows Joe Dunn very well.
I will report as soon as I have spoken with  him.

Thanks
Gary

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This
mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each

David Oxley and have any comments
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.

Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group
mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a
functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.
We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed
at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since
the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most
activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed
that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an
organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All
functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the
acttached.
The actions points from this excercise are:
1 to review and agree the attached mapping
2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in
previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them
as indicated on the attachment.
3 invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider
questionable or requiring further explanation.
Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.
To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final
VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for
your ease of
reference.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Byron/Tiny, I spoke to Ken Jacobs with the Forest Service and have attached
his e mail below concerning the Forest Sevice's choice for the building.  I
have informed him that our new piping and ancillary equipment will remain
white which is consistent with the existing equipment.  He had no problems
with this.  I also had asked him if there was a name for the brown which the
FS uses on their signs and he did not know of a specific name, so I think the
best thing would be to match as closely as possible.


The Forest Service would like the new Compressor Building to be painted
dark brown.  The color should be close to the color that we use for our
signs.  Call me at 520-214-2464 if you would like to discuss this.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions,
that they will certainly be called at trial.  Also, their testimony is
consistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand
the implications of the ruling on these facilities.
Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially
certify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity
is unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev
Proc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that
the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn't
mean increase it from 105 to 115 tons per hour. Also, Coston is going to have
to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I
don't think he's going to lie under oath (maybe I'm naive).
Regardless of the preceding comments, it sounds like we probably need to
talk to Tim W. about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K-M
folks (through their lawyer) about this before the next round of depos.
On a related note, I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several
issues.  First, I told him that if they were interested, we were interested
in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward.  I
questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the
equipment.  He said that this would be up to Mr. Holmes but that he strongly
doubted that "repricing the deal" or "dramatically changing the economics" of
the deal would be acceptable.  I also asked whether he thought a mediation
would be acceptable.  In response, he indicated that although he wouldn't
rule it out, he thought it was premature. Finally, I mentioned that there had
been some talk of deposing him.  He said that his only involvement in the
negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra
and, therefore, these communications would be privileged.  He said he only
met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in August and this
was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing
other things. He also said that he had no involvement with the IRS PLR's. Let
me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this.
Finally, George is still out of town but as soon as he returns, I'll get
with him to get out the letter I know that Greg is anxious that we send out.
Thanks.

On May 10, 2001, a memo was sent out regarding "Peer Group Mapping".  This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.
Please refer to the attached original memo, if you have not responded to David Oxley and have any comments
please respond to him by May 25, 2001.
Dave Delainey
Following my note last week please find attached the consolidated peer group mapping for all business units. This mapping is intended to illustrate from a functional view point where each activity was placed at Year End 2000 VP PRC.
We were considering moving to a 3 Peer Group Structure however it as agreed at the last PRC Committee Meeting  to stay with the current structure since the data had been cleaned and everyone felt generally comfortable where most activities had been placed with the exception of just  2 or 3. It was agreed that we should concentrate on resolving these rather than undertaking an organization wide remapping excercise to consolidate to 3 Peer Groups. All functions/activities within the business units should now be reflected on the acttached.
The actions points from this excercise are:
1	to review and agree the attached mapping
2    consider and comment on highlighted groups that we have discussed in previous PRC meetings and ask for your comments or objections to moving them 	as indicated on the attachment.
3	invite your comments or questions on any other function that you consider questionable or requiring further explanation.
Please return your comments to David Oxley by Friday May 25.
To have this discussion now will save lengthy discussions in the final VP/MD PRC Meetings.  Definitions of the peer groups are also attached for your ease of
reference.

I expect that if Mel didn't examine these witnesses in their depositions,
that they will certainly be called at trial.  Also, their testimony is
consistent with Michael Goldstein's comments to me that I didn't understand
the implications of the ruling on these facilities.
Personally, I think that Platte's testimony that he didn't officially
certify the capacity of the machines in 1998 and, therefore, their capacity
is unknown, is sort of contrived and made-up sounding in light of the Rev
Proc.and the miracle of hindsight. The Sempra representations to the IRS that
the proposed changes would significantly increase production probably didn't
mean increase it from 105 to 115 tons per hour. Also, Coston is going to have
to explain what he meant when he made his representations to the IRS and I
don't think he's going to lie under oath (maybe I'm naive).
Regardless of the preceding comments, it sounds like we probably need to
talk to Tim W. about these issues and also probably need to talk to the K-M
folks (through their lawyer) about this before the next round of depos.
On a related note, I spoke with Michael Goldstein on Tuesday about several
issues.  First, I told him that if they were interested, we were interested
in sitting down and talking about resolving things going forward.  I
questioned whether they would have an open mind toward issues like moving the
equipment.  He said that this would be up to Mr. Holmes but that he strongly
doubted that "repricing the deal" or "dramatically changing the economics" of
the deal would be acceptable.  I also asked whether he thought a mediation
would be acceptable.  In response, he indicated that although he wouldn't
rule it out, he thought it was premature. Finally, I mentioned that there had
been some talk of deposing him.  He said that his only involvement in the
negotiation phase of the project would be in connection with advice to Sempra
and, therefore, these communications would be privileged.  He said he only
met the Enron folks once before the documents were signed in August and this
was supposedly a pretty casual meeting since he was allegedly busy doing
other things. He also said that he had no involvement with the IRS PLR's. Let
me know your thoughts about deposing him in light of this.
Finally, George is still out of town but as soon as he returns, I'll get
with him to get out the letter I know that Greg is anxious that we send out.
Thanks.

Mike Roan and I met with Ed Martin, president of Wabash and Don Morton, his
legal counsel to discuss their support for our RTO position.  (Mike did a
nice job and I believe they will be supportive).

On the business side, Ed Martin would like to talk to someone from Enron to
partner with them on a deal.  They have a load management device that can be
installed in air conditioners (they are meeting with Lenox about this) and
they need a partner to market it this to utilities as a means of reducing
peak load and making power available for resale.  The product is geared
towards the residential , but could be applicable to small, medium commercial
customers and in some cases (depending on utility tariffs and what is
available), larger customers.  The other angle would be to market this
directly to customers, although that does not appear to be their focus.  I
told Ed I would have someone get back to him.  Please advise if you are
interested.

Thanks,
Janine

p.s.  You probably know this, but just in case, according to Ed , TVA is
getting squeezed by Duke and Southern and is quietly lobbying folks like the
Coops to raise the issue of increasing transmission capacity by building
additional transmission lines to better inteconnect the system.

HEADLINE: Californians Fear High Electric Bills

BYLINE: SETH HETTENA


DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

BODY:

Ray Marquez wonders whether he'll have to cut back on food or gas in order
to pay his electricity bill.

The 34-year-old Orange County maintenance man usually pays $80 a month for
power during summer months. Now, he's trying to figure out how to pay an
electricity bill that could push $130 come June 1.

''Since I got married and had children, you know, I've been dealing with
balancing bills,'' he said Wednesday. ''But if I now have to pay more for
electricity, I'm not going to have money for gas or food for the kids.''

As Californians coped with rolling blackouts that darkened thousands of
businesses and homes Monday and Tuesday, many struggled with an even bigger
worry: how to pay for soaring energy costs.

In March, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the biggest rate
increase in California history, up to 46 percent for customers of Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric. Those rate hikes start hitting
customers in next month's bill.

Gailen Kyle, who raises alfalfa on 1,600 acres in the Mojave Desert, says a
40 percent increase would put his farm out of business.

''It would end us,'' the third-generation farmer said. ''Everybody here that
farms alfalfa would be out of business.''

Kyle, 46, said he has to pump water nearly around the clock from wells
drilled 310 feet below his farm near Lancaster. A small increase in the price
of
energy a few months ago added $80,000 to the $400,000 annual bill he was
already
paying.

To save money, Kyle agreed to become an ''interruptible'' customer, meaning
he voluntarily allows his power to be shut off during statewide electricity
shortages in exchange for reduced rates. So far this year, his power has been
cut 26 times.

Even before the state utilities commission raised rates, residents were
paying 26 percent more for electricity than the nationwide average, according
to
federal statistics. Only customers in New England, New York, Alaska and Hawaii
pay more.

One of the problems is that the wholesale cost of electricity has risen
sharply over the past year but under California's 1996 deregulation law the
state's largest utilities, PG&E and SoCal Edison, have been prevented from
passing their costs to customers. In April, PG&E declared bankruptcy.

The West isn't just facing spiraling costs and a shortage of supplies,
however. Its transmission system is fragmented and overworked and would take
years to improve, power officials told the region's governors Wednesday.

''There is no immediate solution,'' said Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, one of
four governors participating in a six-hour, round-table meeting with industry
representatives.

The Western Governors Association was told there is no established method
for
paying for transmission upgrades, and market and regulatory barriers stand in
the way. It's not even clear where new power lines are most needed.

The group, which included the governors of Utah, Idaho, Montana and Wyoming,
has given energy experts until July 15 to recommend ways to eliminate
bottlenecks.

Meanwhile Californians, who've already weathered six days of rolling
blackouts this year, fear they'll soon be paying more for less service.

The Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power grid, has
forecast more than 30 days of blackouts this summer due to severe shortages of
electric supply.

Dee Ann Hendirx, 53, of San Francisco, has stocked up on candles and
battery-operated clocks.

''I hate to say this but it's getting to be a way of life in California,''
she said.

HEADLINE: California Blackout Season Begins

BYLINE: JENNIFER COLEMAN


DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

California's newest season blackout season is here, and it arrived earlier
than expected.

State officials had anticipated a crunch in June, when air conditioners are
cranked up for summer weather. But already, California has been hit with
back-to-back blackouts on Monday and Tuesday, and the operators of the state's
power grid barely scraped together enough energy to avoid blackouts Wednesday.

''We're definitely in blackout season,'' said Michael Shames, executive
director of the Utility Consumer Action Network. ''Right now, there's almost a
disbelieving frustration that is going to elevate quickly to downright
irritable
if we go through a summer of this.''

Grid officials expected fewer problems Thursday, when temperatures were
expected to cool slightly and a large power plant was to return to service.

Hot weather, a high number of power plants down for maintenance and little
power available from other states led to rolling blackouts this week that
affected hundreds of thousands of customers.

Experts expect a long, hot summer of similar drills calls for conservation,
followed by blackouts. California has had six days of rolling blackouts so far
this year, and state regulators are forecasting at least 30 more this summer.

For consumers, the early start of the season has created a mixture of
resignation and exasperation.

''The first day we have a hot day we have an energy crisis,'' said San
Francisco resident Dee Ann Hendrix. ''I hate to say this, but it's getting to
be
a way of life in California.''

Fe Burian, 46, who moved to San Francisco from the Philippines, said the
blackouts had not affected her yet, ''but I come from a Third World country
so I
know how it is.''

It has been a year since consumers in San Diego got the first dose of
shortages and higher costs. Since then, Gov. Gray Davis and other leaders have
tried to deal with the crisis with mixed results.

The state has spent $4.7 billion since January to buy power for its two
largest cash-strapped utilities. On Wednesday, the Legislature approved the
sale
of $13.4 billion in revenue bonds to buy electricity.

Last month, the state Public Utilities Commission approved the biggest rate
increase in California history: up to 46 percent for customers of Southern
California Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric.

Under a plan proposed Wednesday by PUC President Loretta Lynch, the increase
would be structured so that residential customers who use the most
electricity
would face average rate hikes of 35 percent 40 percent, while industrial users
could face increases of 50 percent or more.

In February, Davis streamlined the permit process for new power plants and
created an ambitious conservation program to head off summer blackouts.

But the governor's plan to have 5,000 megawatts of new power online by
midsummer is unrealistic, said Michael Zenker, director of Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, an energy consulting firm.

''There's no basis in fact in that number. We expect between 750 to 1,000
new
megawatts,'' he said. A megawatt is roughly enough power for 750 homes.

Zenker's organization predicted several months ago that the state would see
200 days of severe shortages this summer and 20 days of blackouts. But since
then, the forecast has gotten bleaker because drought in the Northwest is
expected to reduce output from hydroelectric plants.

''Any sort of warm weather will be enough to push us into blackouts,''
Zenker
said.

As for conservation, it will make blackouts shorter and less severe, Shames
said, ''but it won't stop the blackouts from happening.''

Meanwhile, a judge said Wednesday that PG&E can continue paying its natural
gas suppliers, even as other creditors wait to recoup billions of dollars from
the utility.

The decision allows PG&E, which last month filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
protection, to buy gas that it sells to homes and

usinesses.

HEADLINE: Davis asks generators to 'share pain'

BYLINE: Ed Mendel

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Gov. Gray Davis met yesterday with power generators he has accused of
price-gouging and asked them to ''share in the pain'' of California's
electricity crisis by settling for 70 percent of what they are owed by
utilities.

The governor said he told the generators that a key part of his rescue plan
for utilities, the purchase of the Southern California Edison transmission
system by the state, might not be approved by legislators if payments to
generators are not reduced.

Davis said he warned the generators that if Edison is forced to join Pacific
Gas and Electric in bankruptcy, the generators would probably not be paid for
three or four years and might receive even less than 70 percent of what they
are
owed as the judge distributes payments to creditors.

''They could just do the math,'' said Davis, ''and see the value of having a
certain amount of money this year can be higher in many cases than what you
can
expect to get out of the bankruptcy.''

Davis said he told the generators to be prepared to negotiate with
legislators in the next few days. He said he believes that generators
understand
that they must reduce the amount of their current claims.

''I think they understand they have to share in the pain,'' Davis said.
''They have to share in the solution.''

Davis said that of the $3.5 billion that Edison owes, about $1.1 billion to
$1.2 billion is owed to generators. He said he did not have similar figures
for
PG&E. One of the generator executives who attended the nearly four-hour
meeting
in the governor's office did not immediately dismiss the suggestion that
generators be paid less than they are owed.

''I wouldn't say it's completely off the table,'' said Randy Harrison, chief
executive officer of Mirant. ''I think anything that's part of a long-term
comprehensive solution might be something we could discuss at some point.''

But another generator executive who attended the meeting disagreed with the
governor's assessment that generators at the meeting understood that they must
reduce the amount of their claims.

''At this point we feel like we played by the rules,'' said John Stout,
Reliant senior vice president.

It was revealed last week that Duke Energy offered a plan to provide the
state more power and to settle for less than what it was owed if all lawsuits
and investigations into price-gouging were dropped. Davis rejected the offer.

''We are not dropping any lawsuits,'' Davis said he told generators. ''We
are
not dropping any investigations. Quite the contrary, we are pursuing all those
to the hilt.''

Legislators have proposed seizing the power plants of generators and
imposing
criminal penalties for price-gouging. The Senate approved a bill this week
that
could impose a 100 percent tax on any generator revenue of more than $80 per
megawatt hours. The state estimates that it will pay an average of $346 per
megawatt hour for power purchased on the spot market during the second quarter
of this year.

Davis suggested a windfall-profit tax goes against his instincts, but he has
not ruled it out.

''It would cause blackouts,'' warned Reliant's Stout.

The meeting in the governor's office yesterday was attended by the chief
executive officers of Mirant, Enron, Edison Mission Energy, Calpine and
Williams.

Also attending were executives from Reliant, PG&E's National Energy Group,
Duke, AES and El Paso Natural Gas. Executives from Sempra and Dynegy
participated by telephone.

Davis said the main topic was a discussion of ways to help California meet
its energy needs this summer. He said there was an agreement to publicize the
results of power-plant inspections in response to accusations that plants are
being taken off line to drive up electricity prices.

Stout said there was a suggestion that the state sell electricity to the
Northwest during off-peak hours to reduce the drain on hydroelectric
facilities
there and produce revenue for California.

Davis said some of the suggestions from generators were ''blue-sky'' ideas.
''I have no idea if they have merit,'' he said.

Earlier in the day, the state Senate sent Davis a bill authorizing $13.4
billion in bonds to repay the state general fund for power purchases, which
total more than $6 billion so far.

But because Republicans refused to provide the votes needed to allow the
bill
to take effect immediately, a special session on energy will be ended
prematurely Monday to allow the bond measure to take effect 90 days later in
August.

Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San Francisco, said that a new
special session will be called and steps will be taken to return dozens of
stranded bills to their positions in the legislative process, avoiding the
need
to repeat hearings and votes.

The state began buying power for utility customers in January after PG&E and
Edison, whose rates were frozen by deregulation as wholesale power costs
soared,
ran up a $13 billion debt and could no longer borrow.

Davis urged Republicans to reconsider their vote and approve a bond sale
before the new fiscal year begins July 1. If the state general fund is not
repaid, he said that funding may have to be reduced for ''transportation,
hospitals, schools, the environment, law enforcement and other important''
programs.

Assembly Republicans, who wanted to reduce the size of the bonds by not
repaying the general fund for $6.5 billion worth of power, said yesterday that
the new state budget should include a $4 billion reserve for power purchases.

The Assembly GOP point man on the budget, George Runner of Lancaster, said
he
fears that the situation is deteriorating and that California may have to
consider rationing the amount of electricity.

''I believe we are coming very closely to this line that we are no longer
dealing with conservation issues we are dealing with rationing,'' Runner said.

In other action yesterday:

Legislation that would allow San Diego County to form its own municipal
utility district cleared a key hurdle after the bill's author, Assemblyman
Mark
Wyland, R-Escondido, agreed to require voter approval for any new district.

The bill, which has bipartisan support from the San Diego delegation, would
require majority approval before a district could be formed. Current law
requires a two-thirds vote.

Loretta Lynch, chairwoman of the California Public Utilities, said she
hopes
to spare 50 percent of residential power users from any increases under the
pending rate hikes for PG&E and Edison.

The hikes, which amount to about 3 cents per kilowatt hour and raise about
$5
billion annually to cover power costs, will be formally approved Monday by the
commission. Lynch's proposal, which she released yesterday, is one of several
for allocating the increase and calls for heavier electricity users to pay
more
than moderate users.

SDG&E's request for a rate hike will be considered later.

HEADLINE: Bush Energy Stance Begins to Worry Some in GOP

BYLINE: GREG MILLER, RICHARD SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

As power shortages and price spikes spread beyond California, congressional
Republicans are beginning to worry that the Bush administration's reluctance
to
offer much immediate relief could hurt the party in the 2002 elections.

A national energy plan to be unveiled by the White House next week will
focus
on long-term strategies. But with California and other states bracing for a
summer of electricity turmoil and gasoline prices surging across the country,
some GOP lawmakers are pressing for short-term solutions.

"The White House has been taking a look at the big picture," said a GOP
leadership aide in the House. "But they're going to be around in four years.
We
might not have members around in two years if we don't show we care."

That sentiment is being voiced by a rising number of GOP lawmakers. "We're
in
a crisis situation, which is only going to get worse if we don't act very
aggressively," Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) said Wednesday. Gallegly is
one of four congressional Republicans from California to break with the
administration by supporting temporary price controls on wholesale
electricity.

The rising anxiety, which has begun spreading beyond the California
delegation, underscores how much has changed since the state declared its
first
Stage 3 power emergency in December. At that time, Congress' response was
largely: That's Gov. Gray Davis' problem.

Not anymore.

Thirty-nine Stage 3 alerts later, a House committee today will take up a
GOP-drafted emergency bill that would, among other things, allow Davis to
temporarily waive certain emission standards for power plants during an
emergency and provide federal aid to relieve a notorious bottleneck in the
California power grid.

But some GOP lawmakers say the legislation doesn't go far enough, and plan
to
offer amendments containing their own ideas. Rep. Mary Bono (R-Palm Springs)
plans to push for $100 million in energy assistance to low-income households
and
for a directive to federal facilities in the West to cut energy use by 20%.

"House leaders recognize that they could lose the House in California if
there's not an action plan that members can campaign on," said Scott Reed, a
GOP
strategist.

As lawmakers search for ways to provide immediate relief, the White House
continues to cite California's troubles as evidence of the need to upgrade an
aging, overburdened electricity transmission system.

Responding to reports that the administration would propose legislation to
give the federal government eminent domain authority in siting power lines,
White House press secretary Ari Fleischer said Bush wants to ensure that the
distribution infrastructure can move electricity from regions with surpluses
to
regions that need more power.

"That's one of the reasons that California is going through the difficulties
it's going through," Fleischer said. "There is energy available in other parts
of the country, but it can't be shipped to California as easily as you would
hope, because of infrastructure problems."

Fleischer took exception to a front-page story in The Times reporting that
Bush, in a speech delivered Tuesday, "offered no hint of what his
administration
might do" to help California avert a possible economic downturn caused by
power
blackouts.

Though the president did not specifically mention possible actions in the
speech, Fleischer said Bush last week "announced a series of steps, including
conservation," to help California get through an energy crisis this summer.

He said that the Pentagon is reducing its energy needs within California by
10% and that all other federal agencies, at Bush's direction, are reviewing
their energy consumption patterns.

Environmentalists already have begun blasting the administration's energy
plan--even before its details are made public--for what they characterize as a
failure to emphasize energy efficiency and investments in renewable fuels.

Activists Say Crisis Isn't Real

At a Wednesday news briefing, a coalition of environmental advocates
disagreed with the administration's assertion that the country is experiencing
an energy "crisis," and accused it of crafting a plan designed to boost the
profits of key campaign contributors.

"We cannot drill our way out of this situation," said Dan Becker of the
Sierra Club. He and others argued that conserving fuel--with cars that use
less
gasoline and appliances that use less electricity, for example--is the best
way
to avoid energy shortages in the short term.

So far, it is not clear whether the energy crisis will work to either
party's
advantage. Many on Capitol Hill are bracing for an election year that could be
brutal for incumbents of both parties if voters who endure high energy bills
this summer vent their frustration in the voting booth next year.

Some House Republicans acknowledged that they have been pushing the White
House to appear more engaged in finding near-term solutions.

When House Republicans met with Cheney last week, "they urged him and all
the
administration to at least make it clear that a lot of effort is going into
finding a way to solve the problem," said Jim Specht, a spokesman for Rep.
Jerry
Lewis (R-Redlands), leader of the California GOP delegation.

Though some Republicans have offered ideas to address the immediate problem,
it is not clear whether any will receive congressional approval.

Indeed, the emergency assistance bill being taken up today by the House
energy subcommittee faces trouble, although it was drafted by the panel's
chairman, Rep. Joe Barton (R-Texas).

Barton stripped out a number of provisions opposed by environmentalists. But
Democrats plan to seek a vote on capping wholesale electricity prices, a
proposal most Republicans oppose. Democrats also plan to introduce an
amendment
to target natural gas prices.

House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) said the bill "fails
miserably" to address California's problems. "During the campaign, President
Bush promised a sensible energy policy," Gephardt said. "In recent weeks,
however, the president has responded to the gathering crisis by throwing up
his
hands and saying there's nothing we can do, there's no way to give people
immediate relief from blackouts and sky-high increases of price of gasoline at
the pump."

Lawmakers of both parties acknowledge that they are hearing a rising chorus
of constituent complaints about the energy price spikes and supply shortages.

Rep. Chris Cox (R-Newport Beach) was caught in a blackout during a tour of a
computer chip factory in his district. "They said it cost them $1 million if
the
power goes off even for five minutes," said Cox, who nonetheless opposes price
controls.

Cox said he is worried about how the California electricity crisis might
affect the national economy. He said that when he asks business owners about
expanding in California, "they just look at you like you're nuts. They don't
consider California an option because of this uncertainty."

"People come up to you and want you to help solve the problem," said Rep.
George Radanovich (R-Mariposa).

He has explained that there is little the federal government can do in the
short term.

"Californians want somebody to do something," said John J. Pitney Jr.,
associate professor of government at Claremont McKenna College. "When people
are
in a mood like that, politicians get nervous thinking that they're the ones
who
might get blamed."

Said Reed, the GOP strategist: "Every incumbent in California is vulnerable
in the next election, in both parties. This is an issue that is not
ideological.
It's about action and solving a short-term problem. "Politics have taken over
this issue, like it or not," he said. "They may have been raging in California
for the last three or four months. It's now a national political issue."

HEADLINE: Rate Hikes Up to 60% Proposed by PUC Chief;
Power: Lynch says about half the residential customers of Edison, PG&E would
escape increases. Her plan draws fire from all sides.

BYLINE: TIM REITERMAN, NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

About 4 million California residential electricity customers will face
increases in their monthly bills of up to about 60% under a proposal unveiled
Wednesday by the state's chief utility regulator. Interest groups on all sides
promptly condemned the plan as too hard on either consumers or businesses.

The proposal by California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta
Lynch would increase the bills of roughly half of Southern California Edison's
residential customers, who consume medium to heavy amounts, by $8 to $93 a
month. Pacific Gas & Electric Co. customers would be hit with hikes of $6 to
$87
a month.

About half of the residential customers of the state's two biggest public
utilities would see no increase under the proposal if they continued to
consume
energy at their current pace.

Lynch said she could not guarantee that more rate increases would not be
necessary. "Even these astronomical average rates may prove inadequate," she
said, noting that wholesale electricity prices are still high and
unpredictable.
The rate hike, Lynch said at a news conference, is necessary because
"federal
regulators have failed to follow federal laws to ensure just and reasonable
prices."

The deepening energy crisis compelled Lynch to release her proposal after
public hearings on the rate increase already had begun. Lynch said that she
wished her proposal had been ready sooner, but that at least some of the
remaining public hearings will have the benefit of reviewing it.

PUC passage of the essential elements of Lynch's plan seems likely.

Along with two of her colleagues on the five-member commission, Lynch was
appointed by Gov. Gray Davis, and they often vote as a bloc. Lynch said,
however, that testimony later this week from utilities, the public and other
interested parties could prompt modifications.

Structuring the $5-billion rate increase is an important but politically
sensitive step in California's attempt to restore stability to the delivery of
power to 9 million customers of two financially troubled utilities while
protecting the state budget.

The PUC has tried to design rates that would encourage conservation without
damaging business. Competing interest groups, ranging from consumer advocates
to
large manufacturers, have been jockeying for advantage for weeks.

The PUC approved a rate increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour March 27 to
help pay the state's mounting power tab, which now exceeds $5 billion. This
week, the commission is conducting statewide hearings on how the pain should
be
shared among millions of residents and businesses. On Monday the panel is set
to
vote on Lynch's plan and a similar one by a PUC administrative law judge.

Neither proposal appeared to please anyone.

"The PUC says everyone should share the pain, but we think the fair share of
the pain for residential consumers should be zero," said Mindy Spatt,
spokeswoman for the Utility Reform Network, a San Francisco consumer group.
"It
should be paid by commercial and industrial customers who wanted and still
want
deregulation."

Consumer activist Harvey Rosenfield said regulators should go after power
generators and their hefty profits rather than ratepayers.

"Rate increases are not the answer, and this is not going to be the end of
them," said Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights in Santa Monica. "This is like organized crime: The more you give them,
the more they want."

Commercial and industrial customers would see increases of up to 50%, and
agricultural interests would face increases of 23% to 30% under Lynch's
proposal.

Business interests contend that the rate hikes hit them much harder than
residential users.

Calling the proposal "a death knell for the California economy," Jack M.
Stewart of the California Manufacturers and Technology Assn. estimated that
industrial customers would see their power rates increase an average of 53%.
And
the pain of the rate hikes will be compounded by blackouts this summer, which
the group contends will cost California businesses $21.8 billion in lost
productivity.

"For most large manufacturers, energy is a large piece of their operating
costs," Stewart said. "If you add 53% to that, it's going to severely hamper
their ability to do business."

Unlike residential customers, the business customers are not grouped into
tiers based on their amount of usage. Lynch said there was insufficient time
to
establish a tiering system for nonresidential customers by June 1, when the
rate
hikes will start showing up on bills.

An earlier proposal by Lynch had attempted to narrow the gap between
residential rates and the lower rates paid by nonresidential customers. But
the
commission president said that goal could not be immediately achieved without
seriously damaging the state's economy.

To protect the largest users from gigantic rate increases, Lynch's proposal
caps the maximum bill increase at 300% for most customers and 250% for
agricultural customers.

"While we understand bill limiters may have some troubling conservation
impacts, at some point, price signals are unbearable for customers. Bill
limiters will protect customers from unanticipated extraordinary bill
impacts,"
Lynch wrote.

In recent weeks, the commission has received about 20 plans for structuring
the rate increase, including one from Davis, who had proposed a slightly
smaller
overall rate increase. Lynch said her plan incorporates a number of features
of
the governor's plan, including a tiered structure that would punish heavy
users
and reward those who conserve.

Under state legislation, there is no rate increase for consumption up to
130%
of baseline, the amount deemed the minimum needed by a customer in a given
area
and noted on ratepayer bills. Also exempted are low-income customers who
already
receive discounted electricity rates.

Edison and PG&E said they could not assess how the PUC proposals would
affect
their customers because the commission had not provided details to the
utilities
as of late Wednesday.

But PG&E has disputed the commission's claim that half of customers would
not
be affected by the increase, noting that only 32% of PG&E customers never
exceeded 130% of baseline usage in the last year.

Industrial and commercial customers complained that the plan should not
exempt such a large group of residential customers, in any event. A rate
increase for these users--based on the PUC's estimate that the group will
constitute about half of residential customers--could generate an extra $1
billion.

If the PUC insists on exempting so many, the $1-billion shortfall should be
covered solely by other residential users, businesses say.

Under Lynch's plan the burden of paying that amount would be split equally
among commercial, industrial and nonexempt residential customers.

If covering the shortfall were not shared by the three groups, Lynch said,
some residential customers would suffer a 100% increase in their bills.

The proposal calls for a pilot program, including one that would let federal
agencies based in California "experiment with their own market rate policies."

Lynch challenged federal agencies to try to live with "real time," or
hourly,
prices in the volatile wholesale marketplace--a slap at officials of the
Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission who favor a free wholesale market over price
caps.
Use of real-time pricing requires installing a special meter.

"'It would be great if the federal users respond to price signals enough
that
prices come down," Lynch said, adding that she was skeptical that would happen
in today's dysfunctional market.

A FERC spokeswoman declined to comment on Lynch's proposal.

During the third day of PUC hearings, about 200 people gathered at Fullerton
College. Seventy people testified, most venting their anger at elected
officials
and utility companies, whom they blame for the state's flawed deregulation
plan.

"I am opposed to any rate increase for residences and small business,"
testified Ruth Shapin, a Santa Ana attorney. "This crisis was created by
politicians. PG&E and SCE have transferred billions of dollars to their parent
companies. Let them bail themselves out, not the ratepayers."

Others said the baselines might be unfair because the commission had not
taken into consideration home size, the number of occupants and the location.

"It's going to be hard for many people to stay below the 130% baseline,"
said
Sylvia Hartman of Lakewood. "Some customers could easily go 400% over the
baseline."

Rate Hike Proposal

A proposal by California Public Utilities Commission President Loretta Lynch
charges the highest rates to residential customers who use the most
electricity.
The standard for measuring use is a customer's baseline, which is considered
the
minimum amount of electricity needed. Under state law, consumption up to 130%
of
baseline is exempt from the rate increase. The following shows the projected
monthly bill increase for various levels of electricity use:

Southern California Edison



Usage level % increase Cost increase
Baseline 0% $0
200% of baseline 9% $8
300% of baseline 43% $45
400% of baseline 61% $93

Baseline 0% $0
200% of baseline 7% $6
300% of baseline 15% $24
400% of baseline 40% $87

Governor Asks Generators to Take Less Than They're Owed;
Power: Meeting with firms, Davis says that settling for 70% of debt would help
Edison stay solvent. One executive bristles.

BYLINE: DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

After spending months bashing independent power generators, Gov. Gray Davis
on Wednesday called on them to take 30% less than the $1.2 billion they are
owed
by Southern California Edison.

"The Legislature [is] going to insist on a reduction," Davis said after a
meeting in his office with representatives of a dozen power generating
companies. Davis said he told them that "70% this year was more valuable to
them
than whatever they get two or three years down the line" if Edison is forced
into bankruptcy.

Davis urged generators to help California extricate itself from a summer of
rolling blackouts by selling every available electron to the state.

He held out the possibility that he might sign legislation imposing a
windfall profits tax on generators if they fail to help out this summer.

"My attitude on that would depend a lot on whether they showed good faith
and
cooperated throughout this process," Davis said, emerging after a four-hour,
closed-door meeting with the generators.

The Democratic governor issued an invitation last week to the chief
executive
officers of power generating and marketing companies including Enron,
Reliant,
Duke Energy and others to meet with him in Sacramento. But most of the
executives who attended were a few pay grades below CEO.

Davis said he urged that the executives press lawmakers to approve the deal
he struck with Edison in which the state would give the ailing utility an
infusion of cash by buying its transmission system for $2.76 billion. Edison
would use the money to restructure its debt and pay its creditors.

Davis said lawmakers will not approve the deal unless the independent power
generators take less than they are owed.

He noted that the state and the power generators have "a collective interest
in seeing that this summer has as few disruptions as possible." If California
is
hit with repeated blackouts, Davis has said, other states will delay or end
efforts to deregulate their electricity markets.

Executives, who braved taunts from a few protesters wearing pig masks and
carrying a small but loudly squealing pig, characterized the meeting as
businesslike. But at least some generators are less than enthusiastic about
taking less than they are owed.

"I have a real concern about the notion that we should give back some of the
money we made," said John Stout, a senior vice president of the Houston-based
Reliant Energy, which says it is owed $300 million by Southern California
Edison
and Pacific Gas & Electric.

Stout said that much of the money Reliant made in California is being
reinvested in power plant construction--although he added that the company has
no generators under construction in California.

"Political uncertainty has put a huge risk factor on investment in
California," Stout said.

Randy Harrison, an executive with Mirant, based in Atlanta, said the issue
of
a so-called "haircut" was discussed, though not in detail. Harrison said it is
"not completely off the table." But he added that his company is not
profiteering. Nor has it withheld electricity in any attempt to manipulate
wholesale energy prices.

"Our people are working 24 hours a day and we are spending millions of
dollars to try and keep our power plants up and running," Harrison said.

The meeting was aimed at opening communication with the generators. But
Davis
aides said the governor also wanted to bring attention to companies that he
believes are at least partly responsible for California's energy crisis.

The meeting occurred as polls show that voters are increasingly angry about
the energy crisis and as lawmakers, fearful that the energy crisis will wreck
California's economy, sharpen their attacks on power generators.

Legislators have introduced bills to impose a windfall profits tax on
generators and make it a felony to manipulate electricity markets. Lt. Gov.
Cruz
Bustamante and Assemblywoman Barbara Matthews (D-Tracy) sued several
generators
last week. Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer is investigating whether generators
violated
antitrust and other laws as wholesale prices soared to record heights,
hobbling
Edison and helping push PG&E into bankruptcy.

Voters are not sure who is to blame, but they are convinced that "whoever is
taking our money is taking way too much," said Democratic political consultant
Richie Ross.

"They want to find this deregulation's Charles Keating," Ross said,
referring
to a central figure in the 1980s savings and loan debacle.

Still, as much as Davis and others demonize generators, the state needs
them,
some officials say.

"We don't have enough power without them," said Assembly Energy Committee
Chairman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles). "There needs to be an adult
discussion
to see what can be worked out."

Time to Give Some of the Power Players a Haircut

BYLINE: GEORGE SKELTON

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Gray and the Grid. Sounds like an old rock group. And it's slipping fast on
the Capitol charts.

Same with MOU. That's not a rapper, but it's making about as much sense to
most legislators.

MOU--Memo of Understanding--is the complex deal Gov. Gray Davis cut with
Southern California Edison last month to rescue the utility from bankruptcy.
The
key provision is Davis' offer to buy Edison's high-voltage lines--its
grid--for
$2.76 billion.

Of that, $1.5 billion would go to Edison's creditors, the electricity
suppliers the utility has stiffed. Edison customers would kick in another $2
billion to pay off the total debt, estimated at $3.5 billion.

The state would repair and expand the clogged grid--for less money than
Edison could--and collect transmission fees to pay for the lines. It also
would
be in better position to possibly buy bankrupt PG&E's lines and ultimately
place
the entire California grid under public ownership.

Problem is, this deal must be approved by the Legislature. And the governor
can't even find a lawmaker willing to sponsor the bill.

Politicians have looked at polls and seen that voters regard private
utilities as the No. 1 villain in this energy mugging. They're leery of
supporting anything that might smack of a public bailout for Edison.

"It's seen as a gift," Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco) says of
the MOU.

The Davis deal seems DOA. So both legislative houses are drafting
alternatives.

Most Democrats--who own Sacramento--think the creditors should "take a
haircut." That's Capitol jargon for discounting the debt.

Burton figures that a 30% haircut will be necessary for any Edison deal.
That's justified, he and others say, because the creditors--mainly
out-of-state
power companies--have been gouging the utilities anyway.

On Wednesday, Davis agreed. He proposed a 30% haircut in a meeting with
stunned power generators, who had little response.

There must be shared pain, Davis and Burton assert. Shared by creditors,
Edison's parent company, the utility itself and ratepayers. Under the MOU,
only
ratepayers suffer pain.

The liberal Senate leader was an early advocate of acquiring the grid. And
he
still is. But he asserts this MOU isn't needed for that. Perhaps the grid can
be
picked up as a separate ticket.

Across the Capitol, freshman Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los
Angeles)--the former L.A. council member--has been meeting with a small group
that is looking for alternatives to the Davis deal.

"It's uncertain whether we can pass the MOU in its current form," she says.
"But nobody wants to leave this hanging in limbo."

Among the options, she says, is acquiring the grid without paying for it.
Edison would just shift title. That way there'd be no legislative haggling
over
price.

But the state would take care of the utility's debts after creditor
haircuts.
Good trims.

"There's no definition of gouging that wouldn't be appropriate here,"
Goldberg says.

"Maybe the governor could have moved faster. There are a lot of shouldas,
wouldas. But when I get angry, I get angry at FERC and the price gougers."

FERC and the Price Gougers--at the very bottom of the Capitol charts.

Burton and Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks) announced plans
Monday to sue the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. They want to force
FERC
to protect California consumers against the gougers. Obey the law and make
sure
the power pirates charge only "just and reasonable" prices. Return unfair
profits. Set wholesale price caps.

"This case is about old people in convalescent homes, which are not exempt
from blackouts," said the legislators' veteran trial attorney, Joseph
Cotchett.
"We're talking about health and welfare. People on life support machines. This
is not about swimming pool heaters."

It's a longshot suit--two legislative leaders suing the federal government.
There's a doctrine about separation of powers. But the action illustrates
Sacramento's current frustration.

On Wednesday, there was a new group: Gray and the Generators.

The governor invited in the gougers for some frank talk in his office.
Earlier, he had accused them of "just satisfying their greed and sucking money
out of the state."

They weren't in the mood for a Capitol haircut.

But one power official confided that many do wish FERC would be more
aggressive--set hard rules, order refunds if justified and just handle it. The
state Capitol wouldn't be so overheated and there'd be less pressure on the
generators if the Feds did their job.

In that regard, Californians now are beginning to discover another group:
Bush and the Blackouts.

The boos are becoming more raucous.

HEADLINE: Davis Faces Budget Cuts, Report Says;
Finance: The state surplus shrinks by $3.4 billion as tech-firm troubles
reduce
tax revenue. Meanwhile, spending on the energy crisis mounts.

BYLINE: JULIE TAMAKI MIGUEL BUSTILLO, CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

The suffering of California's high-tech firms is taking its toll on the
fortunes of state government, according to the nonpartisan legislative
analyst,
who said Wednesday that the state budget surplus has shrunk by $3.4 billion.

To keep the budget out of the red, Gov. Gray Davis will have to slash his
state spending plan, an unpleasant prospect for those who rely on state
services
and a politically dicey task for a governor facing reelection next year. Among
the areas that could be hit are anticipated transportation projects and a
program to extend health insurance to poor people.

Elizabeth Hill's grim update on the state's financial outlook complicates an
already difficult situation for state officials trying to pay for services
amid
an extraordinarily expensive energy crisis. More than $6 billion has been
drained from California coffers to pay for energy purchases. Hill's assessment
of the state economy and its effect on the budget does not take that money
into
account because it assumes that a bond issue, approved Wednesday, will repay
the
state's general fund.

Should that fall through, her budget estimates would grow more dire.

Hill's office previously estimated an $8-billion state surplus over this
year
and next. But California has been particularly hard-hit by the struggles of
the
state's high-tech firms, which in recent years had fueled huge state tax
receipts as employees cashed out stock options, said Brad Williams, senior
economist for Hill's office.

"This shouldn't be too terribly surprising given the negative developments
in
the economy and the negative developments in the stock market," Williams said.
"The economic picture has changed significantly since January."

In a letter to lawmakers, Hill said onetime and ongoing spending cuts will
be
needed to stave off a deficit that would occur if the governor's spending plan
were put in place. Under that plan, money would be spent faster than it would
come in, according to Hill's projections.

At the rate of spending contemplated by the governor's current budget
proposal, the deficit would hit $1.5 billion in the 2001-02 budget year and
rise
to $6 billion by 2002-03, Hill predicted. To avoid running into the red, Hill
floated the possibility of $2.5 billion in onetime cuts in the next budget and
an annual reduction of $1.7 billion through the 2002-03 fiscal year.

Department of Finance spokesman Sandy Harrison said the Davis administration
would not comment on Hill's projection Wednesday, adding only that the
governor
would account for updated revenue estimates Monday when he releases his
revised
spending plan.

But lawmakers are reacting with alarm and are vowing to cut whatever
programs
are expendable to avoid what some consider the worst alternative: a tax
increase.

"That's the last thing we want to do," said Assembly Budget Committee
Chairman Tony Cardenas (D-Sylmar). "It has crossed our minds. We do not like
the
fact that it has crossed our minds."

Senate Budget Committee Chairman Steve Peace (D-El Cajon) said the nearly $
5-billion shortfall that Hill predicts for the 2001-02 fiscal year is
optimistic. He believes revenue actually could sink as much as $20 billion.

Peace said Hill appears to be projecting that revenue will begin to rebound
toward the end of the year, but he predicted a continued decline as the
economic
downturn manifesting itself on Wall Street trickles down to Main Street.

"I think we are in for a huge problem and that assumes no impact from the
energy stuff," Peace said.

Though legislators appear most determined to avoid a tax increase, cutting
services would represent a political challenge.

Peace suggested that up to $2 billion could be saved by delaying certain
onetime transportation programs that have yet to get off the ground. He warned
that a proposed expansion of the Healthy Families program, which provides
health
insurance to low-income Californians, could be in jeopardy.

Education funding in the upcoming budget year probably will still rise over
the previous year, but fall short of the level contemplated by Davis in
January
by about half a billion dollars, Peace predicted.

Davis' $1.45-billion, three-year plan to extend the middle school year has
faced substantial opposition in the Legislature and may be rejected, which
would
relieve the need to cut other programs.

Without question, the biggest cloud hanging over the budget is whether the
general fund will be repaid for billions of dollars in energy purchases--a
possibility that is quickly dismissed in Hill's analysis.

To avoid blackouts, California has been buying massive quantities of
electricity since January because the state's private utilities had become too
burdened with debt to continue making purchases on the expensive wholesale
power
market.

Davis had planned to reimburse the budget with proceeds from a record $
12.5-billion bond sale and that utility ratepayers would then pay off the
bonds.
But the sale has been delayed until August at the earliest, leaving a gaping
hole in state coffers as lawmakers plan the budget.

Cardenas said it is likely that legislators will be forced to craft a
two-tiered budget this year, one that assumes a bond sale is completed and one
that prepares for the possibility it is not.

There are other uncertainties as well. Consumer activists say they are
considering challenging the bond issue with a ballot measure--a threat that
could further undermine confidence about the bond issue, and California's
financial health, on Wall Street. California's credit rating has already been
lowered by one credit rating agency because of concerns over repayment of the
state budget.

If the bond issue does not go through, "then we have to make cuts
everywhere," Cardenas said. "Everything is up for grabs."

HEADLINE: California Seeks Power Debt Relief

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, May 9

BODY:

Gov. Gray Davis asked power generators today to accept a 30 percent cut in
money they are owed by Southern California Edison, the state's second largest
utility, to help keep it afloat.

The California governor's request came after two days of rolling blackouts
caused by high temperatures and scarce electricity. Grid operators avoided
blackouts today after temperatures dropped slightly.

Officials at the Independent System Operator, which manages the state's
electricity grid, said that supplies would still be tight on Thursday, but
that
slightly cooler weather would help them meet demand.

Southern California Edison owes generators more than $1.1 billion, but they
are unlikely to see their money for years if it declares bankruptcy, Mr. Davis
said he told 12 electricity and natural gas producers.

"I think they understand they have to share in the pain," the governor said.
"They have to share in the solution. I believe they are willing to take some
reduction in the amount of money they are currently claiming."

So far no one is volunteering to forgive the debts.

Southern California air regulators are close to slashing their market-based
system for controlling power plant pollution. The move is intended to allow
large power plants to operate at full capacity without facing stiff fines as
they try to meet demand.

The change was promoted by an executive order from Governor Davis requiring
air districts to let large generators run at the greatest capacity.

HEADLINE: Power bills set to skyrocket for heavy users;

Graduated rate increase would take effect in June

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: David Lazarus

BODY:
As state regulators outlined plans to raise residential electricity bills by
as
much as 40 percent, the head of the Public Utilities Commission warned
yesterday
that power rates could soar even higher.

The PUC, which adopted an increase in March, is scheduled to approve
details
of the new rates in San Francisco on Monday. Consumers will see the higher
rates
in their June utility bills.

State regulators say nearly half of all consumers will see no change in
their power bills. The remainder will experience rate increases ranging from 3
percent to more than 50 percent, depending on the type of customer and the
amount of power used.

The increases would be added to an average 10 percent increase adopted in
January.

PUC President Loretta Lynch suggested that rates could rise yet again if
wholesale electricity prices continue to surge this summer.

"If the sellers decide to turn up the heat and raise prices, we'll have to
look again at the numbers," she said.

INCREASE WILL CONTRIBUTE LITTLE

The proposed rate increase would bring in about $5 billion annually -- a
fraction of the estimated $65 billion California will spend this year
purchasing
power on behalf of the state's cash-strapped utilities.

Lynch said she expects the remainder to be made up by issuing bonds. The
state Senate yesterday approved $13.4 billion in bonds to help cover
California's power costs.

However, those bonds would not be released until August, by which time
California's energy tab would be billions of dollars higher.

"There's huge cause for concern that this latest rate increase is a down
payment rather than anything close to a final installment," said Bob
Finkelstein, staff attorney for The Utility Reform Network in San Francisco.

The PUC's Lynch stressed that while California's new rate structure would
place a greater burden on the state's heaviest power users, the increases are
intended to spread the pain among all consumers.

"Energy is expensive for every hour of every day for every customer," she
said.

LINING UP TO GET PAID

That includes the state Department of Water Resources, which is spending
about $70 million a day to keep California's lights on.

While the PUC is moving to have more money collected from consumers to pay
California's power bills, it has yet to address the thorny question of how the
proceeds will be distributed among the various parties lined up for
compensation.

The Water Resources Department wants all rate-related revenues to first
replenish state coffers, while Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co. insist that they be paid as well for their own expenses.

The utilities' costs include payments to small power generators that can no
longer afford natural gas to run their plants. The recent closure of hundreds
of
such facilities is a key reason California is experiencing blackouts this
week.

Although PG&E said yesterday that most of the smaller generators with which
it does business are now back online, it is not yet clear whether the utility
will be able to keep paying for their power.

"It appears that everything (from the rate increase) is going to DWR (the
Water Resources Department)," said John Nelson, a PG&E spokesman.

Lynch said the PUC will take up the matter of apportioning funds at an
unspecified future date.

CONSERVATIVE USE PAYS

For the moment, state regulators have their hands full digesting two
competing -- and highly complex -- proposals for how rates should be increased
next week.

One proposal was submitted by an administrative law judge working with the
PUC and the other by Lynch. Commissioners will choose between them on Monday.

The two proposals are largely identical. Under both, residential customers
who can keep electricity usage within 130 percent of predetermined limits
would
experience no rate increase.

The "baseline usage" figure -- included near the bottom of PG&E bills --
represents the minimal amount of power consumers require. It includes a number
of variables, such as climate, time of year and type of fuel used.

The PUC said about half of all utility customers statewide historically
stay
within 130 percent of baseline limits.

Heavy residential users whose electricity usage tops 400 percent of
baseline
figures would see power bills rise by as much as 40 percent. Heavy commercial
and industrial users would see bills rise by more than 50 percent.

The average increase for all PG&E residential customers would be about 16
percent, the PUC said, although this number is skewed by the addition of all
those customers whose bills would remain unchanged.

Harvey Rosenfield, head of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights
in Santa Monica, questioned whether these rate increases will be sufficient to
motivate greater conservation among consumers and thus ease California's
energy
woes.

He called instead for the state's political leaders to seize generating
plants from out-of-state power companies and impose a special tax on the
companies' "windfall" profits.

"Unless our elected officials take action, this is just the beginning of
our
rate increases," Rosenfield warned.

FEDERAL BUILDINGS IN SIGHTS

One of the main differences between the two rate-increase proposals is
Lynch's inclusion of a "real-time pricing program" for federal agencies.

If enacted, she said, federal buildings in California would be fully
exposed
to the volatile wholesale power market and would pay whatever California pays
to
keep the lights on throughout the day.

Lynch denied that this is an effort on the part of California officials to
drive home to federal authorities the impact of sky-high wholesale
electricity
prices.

"It's just an experiment," she said.

While California officials have called on federal regulators and the Bush
administration to assist the state by capping wholesale power prices,
Washington
has provided only limited relief to date.

The Utility Reform Network's Finkelstein complained that the proposed rate
increases place a severe burden on residential customers when commercial and
industrial users account for the greater percentage of power consumption.

"It was the commercial and industrial customers who were clamoring for
deregulation," he said. "You didn't hear any calls for deregulation from
residential customers."

Lynch said she was aware that residential users are being asked to carry a
high proportion of the load but said efforts to force industrial users to pay
higher rates ran into political opposition.E-mail David Lazarus at

HEADLINE: Generators silent on Davis plan;

He offers lower compensation to stave off Edison bankruptcy

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Gov. Gray Davis, who has portrayed power generators as greedy villains in the
state's power crisis, met face-to-face with industry officials yesterday,
calling on them to forgive some of the debt racked up by an insolvent utility.

In a three-hour meeting described as "businesslike," Davis said generators
will have to accept 70 cents on the dollar of past debt as part of a solution
designed to prevent Southern California Edison Co. from going bankrupt.

At least one of the companies flatly rejected the idea after the meeting,
putting the deal in jeopardy.

If the two sides are not able to reach an agreement, Southern California
Edison would probably follow Pacific Gas & Electric Co. into bankruptcy court,
where creditors face a lengthy and uncertain resolution to recovering debts.

Davis has run into legislative opposition to the original terms of the
agreement he brokered with Southern California Edison, which includes the
state's purchase of the utility's transmission lines as a way to help it
regain
financial stability.

But the governor said he now believes that the deal can win passage in the
Legislature if the generators "take a haircut."

"I indicated that passage of the (agreement) that we signed with Edison
would only work if they agreed to reduce the amount of money they claim the
utilities owe them,

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Hi Mark,
This email is in reference to our meeting today regarding the following issues:
1.  Meeting with Mark Braemer (??) to discuss subjective inputs to your credit models (to be released this summer).
2.  Your willingness to let us use some of your data (in files on the 6th floor) to experiment with Moody's RiskCalc.
In the near future I would love to meet with Mark and some of the model developers to learn more about their modeling process - especially the subjective component.  Please let me know how I can contact Mark and any relevant parties.
Also, thank you in advance for allowing Kyriakos access to your files on the 6th floor.  We will contact you on Tuesday morning to find out when it is convenient for him to come down.
More specifically, to evaluate Moody's RiskCalc we will need the following financial inputs for Enron's North American (private firm) counterparties:
Fiscal Year
The prior twelve months of financial data are represented. Annual statements are usable as well as quarterly statements after summing the flow variables, such as cost of goods sold, net income, sales, and EBIT. The value should be a four-digit integer year without mention of the day or month such as 1999 or 2000. Forecasts until the year 2009 can be made. A constant rate of inflation is applied to future years using last year's (1999) inflation level. In general this 'estimation error' will not cause any great problems, as size affects default rates at very large scales (e.g., $10,000,000 vs. $1,000,000 makes a significant difference, $1,000,000 vs. $1,050,00 does not).
Cash & Equivalents
This measure of liquid assets includes cash and marketable securities.
Inventory
Inventories are taken directly from the balance sheet, in thousands dollars, without any alterations for accounting method (e.g., LIFO, FIFO, Average Cost). This item represents merchandise bought for resale and materials and supplies purchased for use in production of revenue. Specifically this would include purchase cost, sales cost, sales taxes, transportation costs, insurance costs, and storage costs.
Current Assets
This item primarily represents cash, inventories, accounts receivables, marketable securities, and other current assets.
Total Assets
Total Assets and every other variable are entered in thousands of dollars. For example, $15,500,000 should be entered as 15500. Specifically, total assets are the sum of current assets plus net property, plant, and equipment plus other noncurrent assets (including intangible assets, deferred items, and investments and advances). Leave previous year's total assets blank for Australian companies.
Current Liabilities
Liabilities are positive values. Included in current liabilities are short-term debt, accounts payable, and other current liabilities.
Total Liabilities
This balance sheet account, total liabilities, is a positive number representing the sum of current liabilities plus long-term debt plus other noncurrent liabilities (including deferred taxes, investment tax credit, and minority interest).
Retained Earnings
Retained Earnings, a historical measure of performance, is the cumulative earnings of the company less total dividend distributions to shareholders. Typically, it is the prior year's retained earnings plus net income less distributions. Retained earnings are generally positive. Some firms with low credit quality will have negative retained earnings. Leave this field blank for Australian companies.
Sales
This item consists of the industry segment's gross sales (the amount of actual billings to customers for regular sales completed during the period) reduced by cash discounts, trade discounts, and returned sales and allowances for which credit is given to customers.
Cost of Goods Sold
Entered in thousands of dollars, this value is generally a positive number less than sales. It represents all costs directly allocated by the company to production, such as material, labor, and overhead. Not fixed overhead or items that would be included in Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses. Leave this field blank for Australian companies.
EBIT
Earning before interest expense is operating income after depreciation. It can be positive or negative but is usually greater then net income.
Interest Expense
This item represents the periodic expense to the company of securing short- and long-term debt. Typically, we expect this charge to be approximately the prevailing interest rate times the total liabilities. One measure of computing this is: Interest Expense = 0.07 * total liabilities.
Net Income
This item represents the income (or loss) reported by a company after expenses and losses have been subtracted from all revenues and gains for the fiscal period including extraordinary items and discontinued operations. A loss is represented by a negative sign. For example, a $5,000,000 loss would be entered as -5000. Leave previous year's net income blank for Australian companies.
Extraordinary Items
Positive or negative, this item represents unusual items that sometimes appear on the income statement. The items are designated by the company as extraordinary and presented after net income from continuing operations and discontinued operations. These items include extraordinary gains/losses, income (loss) from discontinued operations, and cumulative affect of accounting changes. Expenses are entered as negative values, gains as positive values. Leave previous year's extraordinary items blank for Australian companies.
Country
This model is calibrated for the United States, Canada, and Australia.

trees to be removed for the turbine construction activities be flagged for
identification.  After the trees have been marked, we are to then contact him
so that he can visit the site and make an evaluation as to whether the Forest
Service will charge us for the tree removal or whether no additional charges

Deregulation not to blame but Davis is: His inaction allowed a problem to
become a power, and fiscal, crisis
By Pete Wilson
(Published June 3, 2001)

The plain and simple reason California will inescapably suffer hundreds of
hours of blackouts this summer is because California will not have a
sufficient supply of electrical power to meet demand. Five years ago, when
deregulation was passed by unanimous vote of both houses of the Legislature
(and without a murmur of dissent from any Democratic constitutional officer,
including then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis), California enjoyed an excess of supply
over demand amounting to some 30 percent.
Deregulation was enacted to create free market competition; first, to drive
down what were then among the very highest power costs in the nation and,
second, to attract private power providers to invest in the creation of new
generating capacity to meet the exploding power needs of the New Economy and
keep in California all the jobs that it would produce.
And deregulation did succeed in stimulating a significant increase in
applications to build power plants, especially after the effective date of
the legislation in 1998 and the defeat that year by California voters of
Prop. 9 (which unwisely sought to repeal deregulation). The total megawattage
of the filings for 1998 doubled that for 1997. After the effective date
(March 1998) of the deregulation legislation, AB 1890, and the defeat of
Proposition 9 (November 1998), removing the threat of repeal, the total for
1999 was double that of 1998 -- exceeding the 5,000 MW mark in '99 alone.

Just look at the filings for 1997, 1998, 1999 and 2000 in the California
Energy Commission graph (above). Far from causing the problem of energy
shortage, as the Davis administration charges, deregulation caused providers
to file -- by mid-2000 -- applications to build new power plants that
promised to add 10,000 megawatts to California's power supply.
That's why I signed it.
I did so even though I disagreed with two of the provisions of AB 1890 --
just as I (and every other governor in history) signed other bills which,
though imperfect, promised significant and needed beneficial change from the
status quo, which was certainly true of deregulation.
No one could have anticipated in 1996 the combination of factors -- less
hydroelectric output in the West, warmer summers, sharply higher electricity
demand, constraints on natural gas supply -- that turned an electricity
surplus into an electricity problem by 2000. The reason we will suffer power
blackouts this summer is because the Davis administration has by inaction
allowed a problem to become a crisis. Now the power crisis threatens to
become a state fiscal crisis.
Governor Davis has been quoted as saying, "If I wanted to raise rates, I
could have solved this problem in 20 minutes." Sadly, by temporizing on
needed actions to raise rates and other steps required to avert crisis, he
made crisis inevitable. As a result, California bonds have suffered two
downgrades by Wall Street rating agencies, and he has put in jeopardy state
spending for parks, schools, transportation and other capital needs. He has
been warned by the state legislative analyst to sharply reduce the state
budget.
The administration failed to monitor either the explosive growth in
electricity consumption by the New Economy in the last five years, which
gobbled up the energy surplus that existed at the time of deregulation, or
the curtailment of production of natural gas, which led to price spikes in
recent years. It failed also to heed early warnings from weather forecasting
agencies that the summers ahead would be among the hottest in a century.
It ignored a 1998 warning by the California Energy Commission of possible
energy shortages by as early as 2000. And when possibility became hard, hot
reality in San Diego in 2000, it continued to ignore it, putting in place a
political, palliative rate cap instead of dealing with the problem.
Fully a year ago, or earlier had he chosen to do so, Governor Davis could
have invoked the almost unlimited powers conferred upon the governor of
California by the State Government Code to deal with an emergency, including
explicitly the sudden and severe shortage of electrical energy. These powers
include the suspension of statute and regulation. It was this power that I
used after the Northridge earthquake in 1994 to rebuild and reopen Los
Angeles' shattered freeways -- just 64 days after their destruction, instead
of taking the two and one half years that would otherwise have been required
by law.
Fully a year ago, Davis could have acted unilaterally, without the
Legislature, to suspend operation of the rate cap that the investor-owned
utilities (PG&E, SCE and SDG&E) recently complain of but eagerly requested at
the time of enactment.
He could have, by decree, suspended the provision that prohibited the
utilities from forward contracting with power wholesalers.
He could have, by executive order, suspended and truncated the nightmarish
process required by state law for approval of siting. Had he done so early
enough, when he might even have made a difference this summer, and done so
not just with peaker plants but also with large plants, he might have greatly
accelerated construction of the power plants that will be required to allow
us to escape from blackouts, power price spikes and the severe job loss and
economic injury certain to result from a power supply that is neither
reliable nor affordable.
All these actions, Governor Davis could have taken a year ago -- or earlier:
A governor can foresee the emergency and exercise his extraordinary powers to
prevent it. He is not required to wait and compel California to suffer it.
Had the governor heeded the early warnings -- about hot weather, or the
threat of insolvency to the utilities -- and had he acted, using the full
range of his extraordinary emergency powers when he should have, he could
have prevented the problem from becoming the crisis it has become.
We might have incentivized power providers to build enough new plants fast
enough to avoid blackouts this summer.
PG&E would not have been compelled to declare bankruptcy and Southern
California Edison would not be teetering on the brink.
Energy costs would not have spiked to the present outrageous levels.
The state would not have burned through billions of taxpayers' dollars.
And California's jobs would not be threatened, as they are, by raiders from
other state governments who are aggressively seeking to lure California
employers to their states and steal our jobs.
The blame game waged by the governor's office adds insult to injury. It will
provide no comfort to Californians sweltering in darkness this summer. But it
does do a serious disservice to ratepayers and taxpayers by seeking to
mislead those who are not aware of the real, unhappy facts of California's
present crisis.
The honest explanation for it is simple, not rocket science: State government
cannot ignore the law of supply and demand. It is not the state's
responsibility to build power plants. But it is its responsibility to create
a regulatory environment that will give incentive to private sector providers
to do so. Deregulation, even with imperfections that the governor could have
cured by fiat if the need arose, was a significant advance in achieving that
incentive as subsequent filings by providers attest.
The problem grew into a crisis not because of deregulation but because of
Governor Davis' failure to act. That is the plain, unhappy truth of the
matter. I take no joy in saying so. I have been prepared to be helpful to the
governor during this very serious challenge to our state's well-being, just
as when I responded to his request for my assistance in passing Proposition
39 (the school bond issue) in the most recent election.
Just as my perception of what was best for California caused me to help him
then, I am compelled now to speak out to prevent the rewriting of history and
a deliberate effort to mislead the public and to discredit deregulation in
order to shift the blame for his own inaction.

Pete Wilson is the former governor of California.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Kenny's comments are absolutely false or, at best,  grossly misleading.  We
need to respond to him.
The NUMBER ONE problem we have in California that is delaying our proposed
power plant developments is securing ERCs.  My discussions with Calpine
indicate that ERCs are their biggest problem as well.  (And in case someone
hasn't noticed, the two most active developers in CAlifornia are Enron and
Calpine.)  Air quality laws are definitely slowing us down, and slowing
others down, which keeps the new, cleaner plants from being developed.  As I
have mentioned before, this is actually making air quality worse in that the
older, dirtier plants are running more.  Further, if you do the math, we will
probably never make up for the dirty air that is created by keeping the dirty
plants in business because of grandfathering, while the clean plants don't
get done because of ever more rigorous BACT standards and lack of ERCs.
Having said that, I do not agree that we should send a message that we want
to relax or suspend the standards.  (However, getting 2ppm plants on line,
which will put out of business the 100+ppm plants - as Calpine indicated to
me happened in Texas - makes the point that maybe a relaxation or suspension
is the environmentally appropriate thing to do.)  All in all, though, I
believe that sucha common sense approach will go nowhere in California
because the little people in the regulatory positions as well as the public
will make sure that we pay for such a message.  Having said that, I will
repeat the key things that we should be promoting, in my opinion:  1.)  stop
the EPA from tightening the BACT standards to ever increasing levels of
insanity.  (GE will not guarantee the present, and new, EPA requirement of
2ppm, which EPA "determined" with no new operating data.  They just did it
because they could.)  2.)  Stop making up rules for RACT adjustments.  (Kelly
Brodbeck is working very hard, for example, to develop a program in the Bay
Area to retrofit boats with clean burning engines to create ERCs.  A high
level staff guy at BAAQMD "believes" that we should be RACT adjusted,
probably making the program uneconomic.  There isn't even unanimity for this
position on his staff.  However, this position if it sticks is irresponsible
in light of the fact that the boats can just keep on doing what they are
doing.  We are creating ERCs, which the BAAQMD will take a portion of in
their haircut, and in using the ERCs, we will eventually put out of business
the dirtier plants.  So, our program gets RACT adjusted and the air gets
dirtier...)  3.)  Allow for payment of mitigation fees in lieu of buying
ERCs.  There is precedent for that, but this has to be run through the SIP
and the EPA.  Again, the in-lieu fees can be used for gov sponsored ERC
developments (e.g., electric lawn mowers, electric water heaters, etc.),
which will clean the air.  I am aware that Sandy is working with the CA
legislature on this.  Go Sandy!

Rate hikes bigger worry than blackouts, poll says
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published May 22, 2001)
The vast majority of Californians expect to be inconvenienced by power
blackouts this summer, but two-thirds continue to be far more concerned about
higher electricity rates they believe are unjustified, according to a Field
Poll released Monday.
Meanwhile, 85 percent of the state's residents say they have cut back their
energy use since the crisis began, and nearly two-thirds believe they can
conserve an additional 5 percent to 10 percent.
As they were at the outset of the crisis, poll respondents remain skeptical
of the power shortage's root cause. Nearly six out of 10 say the crisis is an
attempt by energy companies to increase rates, rather than the results of a
real market imbalance.
"As the seriousness of the issue has gone up, the cynicism has remained
high," said Mark DiCamillo, director of the San Francisco-based poll. "The
public still doesn't buy the claim that it's supply and demand. They think
it's an artificial crisis."
The poll results, obtained by interviewing a cross-section of 1,015 adults
between May 11 and Sunday, are part of a special survey the Field Institute
undertook to measure public opinion about the energy crisis. Subsequent
releases will survey attitudes about the available policy options and the
policy-makers who might exercise them.
Monday's results show Californians are reacting negatively to higher
electricity rates, even though the most recent increase has yet to appear on
their monthly bills.
In a finding nearly identical to Field's January survey, 67 percent are more
concerned with higher rates than power blackouts.
And that does not bode well for the elected officials trying to solve the
problem, DiCamillo said. Pocketbook issues such as rate increases, he said,
"focus more public opinion on the actors in this drama -- the politicians."
A majority (52 percent) believes the $5 billion rate increase approved by the
state Public Utilities Commission last week for customers of Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. and Southern California Edison was not justified, and an
identical proportion believes the rate increase will cause a "somewhat" or
"very serious" problem in their households.
The proportion of people who believe the increases will cause "very serious"
problems corresponds to their family income. Among those earning $20,000 or
less, 27 percent believe the increases will cause very serious problems. Ten
percent of those earning $80,000 or more believe very serious problems will
occur.
In contrast, 27 percent say blackouts have caused a "great deal" or "some"
inconvenience thus far, although 71 percent believe expected blackouts this
summer will cause the same degree of inconvenience. More low-income residents
(45 percent) say they will experience a great deal of inconvenience from
summer blackouts, compared with just 26 percent of those in the $80,000 and
above category who feel the same way.
The poll shows that the 85 percent of respondents who estimated they have
conserved power have cut back, on average, about 8 percent. Gov. Gray Davis
has asked all residents and businesses to reduce power use by
10 percent, although Davis' plan assumes a 7 percent reduction. Eighty-five
percent also say they can conserve even more, with additional savings, on
average, amounting to 4 percent.
Six out of 10 believe the state can avoid blackouts this summer through
conservation.
"These numbers are a good guess as to what real conservation is being
achieved and what is likely to be achieved, and it's not a huge amount,"
DiCamillo said.

Energy Digest: Half-hour warning for blackouts?


(Published May 22, 2001)
Grid operators are hoping to issue power blackout warnings a half-hour in
advance, but the new alerts would be educated guesses and blackouts might not
follow.
The proposed warning system is expected to be approved Thursday by the board
of the California Independent System Operator, the Folsom-based organization
that runs most of the state's high-voltage transmission system.
Although an unknown number of the alerts will turn out to be false alarms,
"this would be a huge step forward" for businesses, said Carl Guardino, head
of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and a member of the ISO board.
"For employers, a half-hour is the time needed to fire up a major generator,
to power down an assembly line, to have your employees save what they have on
their computers," he said.
By comparison, the last two rounds of rotating blackouts came with two- and
six-minute warnings, Guardino said.
The new system could be put in place by June 1, and might also include
expanded systems for giving e-mail notifications of power alerts or potential
blackouts, ISO officials said.

Connell plans to borrow
State Controller Kathleen Connell says Gov. Gray Davis' energy plan doesn't
add up.
Connell said at a news conference Monday that the state will spend money on
electricity at a faster rate than anticipated by Davis, a fellow Democrat.
As a result, Connell said, she expects to borrow about $4 billion this fall
to avoid state budget cash shortages in the coming fiscal year.
"We are virtually in the same kind of fiscal environment that we were in a
bad budget year," Connell said.
In recent years, the state has regularly borrowed money through one-year
revenue anticipation notes to avoid cash-flow problems. The notes are paid
off within a year when enough tax money flows to the state treasury.
But Connell didn't have to resort to borrowing this year because of plentiful
revenue and a healthy reserve.
Connell said the state's energy purchases have changed the picture, and
called into question Davis' assumptions. The governor's plan calls for 11
percent of the power purchases in the first half of this year to be covered
by lower-cost, long-term contracts. As of last week, only 1 percent of the
purchases were under contracts, Connell said.
But Joe Fichera, Davis' financial adviser, said that seven more long-term
contracts for electricity during peak demand periods this summer will be
delivered to Connell's office today.

Suit to seek price caps
The state Legislature plans to file suit today in federal court in a bid to
force the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to impose caps on power
prices.
The lawsuit will argue that the commission has failed to ensure that
Californians are paying just and reasonable rates, as required under the
Federal Power Act.
The suit is being filed by Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco, and Assembly Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Sherman Oaks. Hertzberg
said consumer groups and others are also expected to join the suit.
As evidence, the suit will cite reports earlier this year by the California
Independent System Operator that the state's electricity market was not
resulting in just and reasonable rates. The ISO is responsible for running
the state's transmission grid.
The suit will cite evidence of how high power rates are causing harm to
society, Hertzberg said.
--John Hill

U.S. attacks special rate
Before the idea goes any further, the federal government Monday asked state
utility regulators to junk a proposal for a special, high-priced federal
energy rate.
In an emergency appeal, federal officials asked the state Public Utilities
Commission to take a special vote Thursday to drop the idea of even
researching a pilot program, calling it discriminatory and a waste of time.
As part of a vote last week that created new electricity rates, the PUC also
launched a study into charging all federal facilities market-based prices for
power -- a move widely seen as a dig against federal authorities who have
refused state pleas to cap wholesale prices.
But three of the five PUC commissioners said at the time that they disliked
the idea and would consider other options.
Given their reluctance, it would be a waste of utilities' scarce resources to
even begin researching how to assess the special rate, the Department of the
Navy wrote the PUC on Monday, arguing on behalf of all federal executive
agencies.

What's the hang-up?
Clotheslines save energy and money, but they are considered unsightly by some
and are banned in many areas
By Mary Lynne Vellinga
Bee Staff Writer
(Published May 21, 2001)

Rising electricity rates have prompted Stacey Swett to seriously consider
taking a step she finds somewhat distasteful: hanging a clothesline in her
back yard.
"I don't really like the looks of them, but you have to get past that; we
have a huge issue here with our SMUD bill," Swett said.
The California Energy Commission touts clotheslines as a nearly cost-free way
to conserve electricity. Statewide, clothes dryers burn about 1,000 megawatts
of electricity on a hot summer day, which could be enough to avert a blackout
on days when state power supplies are tight. An electric dryer costs about
$130 a year to run. A retractable clothesline will set you back about $14.99.
People appear to be getting the message. Hardware stores report a sharp rise
in clothesline sales since the energy crisis hit. People are "going back to
the old way of doing things," said Dave Haskin, owner of Broadway Hardware in
Sacramento.
But the old way of doing things doesn't sit so well in some newer
neighborhoods. Where Swett lives, in midtown, she can decide for herself
whether to take the plunge and pin up the bloomers. But in many newer
neighborhoods -- those governed by homeowners associations -- the practice is
not allowed.
Swett works for the management company that runs the homeowners association
for the gated, Pocket-area subdivision of Riverlake. In Riverlake, it is
against the rules to hang your laundry where your neighbors can glimpse it.
The same is true in Gold River, Rancho Murieta, Laguna West and Los Lagos,
the mansion-studded Granite Bay enclave where Sacramento Kings stars Chris
Webber and Jason Williams live.
"People think (clotheslines) are unsightly," said Dan Kocal, owner of the
Folsom-based Kocal Management Group. His company manages the homeowners
associations for 70 communities in the Sacramento region. Not one of them
allows clotheslines unless they are shielded from neighbors' views below the
fence line or behind a special enclosure.
When people buy into planned communities such as Gold River, Los Lagos or Sun
City, they agree to certain rules designed to keep the neighborhood looking
neat and uniform, Kocal said.
"You agree that you're only going to park in the garage, that you're not
going to hang out clothes and that you're not going to paint your house
purple," Kocal said.
Clotheslines that can be seen from neighboring yards are banned by virtually
all the 35,000 California subdivisions and condominium complexes governed by
homeowners associations, said Richard Monson, president of the Pasadena-based
California Association of Homeowners Associations.
"We choose to live in neighborhoods that don't hang these things out," Monson
said.
A few weeks ago, Monson was quoted as saying that the sight of hanging
laundry is "akin to graffiti in your neighborhood." Cartoonist Garry Trudeau
since has devoted an entire week of his Doonesbury strip to lampooning
neighborhoods that don't allow clothes to be hung out to dry.
Now, Monson chooses his words more carefully. "When we talk about areas of
communities that are less desirable, we often associate those with
undesirable items that are in proximity to the buildings," he said. He stands
by his assertion that the sight of clothes flapping in the breeze could knock
15 percent off property values.
Brian Rosebrock, a supervisor at the new Home Depot in Elk Grove, doesn't
understand the stigma. When he was growing up in a rural area outside New
York City, his mother always dried the family's clothes on the line.
Rosebrock, 40, still likes the smell of sun-dried clothes. He hangs his
jeans, socks, sheets and other cotton items in the back yard of his Rosemont
house.
"It's just laundry. Everybody is a little uptight here," he said of
Californians.
He may have a point. Bruce Hackett, professor emeritus of sociology at the
University of California, Davis, said Californians harbor more negative
attitudes toward clotheslines than do people in the Midwest, where line
drying is more of a tradition.
About 10 years ago, Hackett did a survey of 45 UC Davis students and 35
single-family households in Green Bay, Wis. At the time, some students living
in married housing on the UC Davis campus were upset that they had to walk to
an isolated, screened area next to the trash bins to hang their laundry.
"The housing office said clotheslines make the place look like a tenement,"
Hackett said.
The attitude in Wisconsin was markedly different.
"On wash day, there were just clotheslines everywhere, which is something you
don't find here," Hackett said. "One woman told me that when you move into a
new home it's not really your home until your clothesline is up and your
clothes are on it."
In the wake of student complaints, the university eventually changed the
policy to allow the use of retractable clothes lines in the housing area,
Hackett said.
Leaders of several Sacramento-area homeowners associations said they couldn't
think of any instance in which a homeowner has asked permission to hang a
clothesline or has gotten in trouble for using one.
"I don't know of anyone who has a clothesline," said David Brickell,
president of the Los Lagos Estates Homeowners Association. He said the Los
Lagos neighborhood is very concerned about the energy crisis and thus "would
certainly consider" allowing clotheslines.
To save energy, the subdivision has started turning off its entrance fountain
at night and is considering buying a smaller fountain pump.
Monson, head of the statewide association, argued that there are many ways to
conserve energy without resorting to the public airing of laundry. Wet
clothes can, for instance, be hung in the garage or the utility room, he
said.
"The issue is not clotheslines, the issue is conservation, and hom'eowners
don't have to hang their clothes out of doors," he said.
But some energy-conscious citizens think discouraging the use of outdoor
laundry lines is ridiculous, given the state's energy situation.
Jennifer Putnam, 41, recently purchased a large umbrella-style apparatus to
dry clothes in her Jackson back yard.
"We were standing outside by the (electric) meter at one point, two or three
months ago. My husband said, 'Look at how fast that thing is going around.' I
said, 'The only thing on is the dryer.' "
"During World War II, we had to do certain things," Putnam continued. "Now,
we're looking at a power crunch, we're looking at saving an economy in
California. That's critical. That's important.  I really don't think Granite
Bay is going to turn into a slum because people put up things to dry their
clothes on."

Dan Walters: One year later, we know it wasn't just a simple game of golf


(Published May 20, 2001)

California will mark -- but certainly not celebrate -- an anniversary this
week. It was exactly one year ago that a late spring heat wave swept over San
Diego, and as air conditioners began drawing heavy amounts of power, San
Diego Gas & Electric Co. began charging its customers high, market-oriented
rates for juice.
It was the beginning of the California energy crisis, or at least of public
and political awareness that something was wrong. And a year later, every
aspect of the crisis continues to grow worse. We are paying 10 times as much
for power as we were two years ago. We have amassed more than $20 billion in
private and public debt that will grow even with sharp increases in consumer
power rates. And we face potentially life-threatening summer blackouts.
Certainly the roots of the crisis extend much further than one year. They go
back to decisions in the 1970s to stop major power plant construction and
rely on conservation and alternative generating sources. And they include a
momentous decision in the mid-1990s to adopt a "deregulation" plan that was
an unworkable hybrid of open markets and price controls that left us at the
mercy of out-of-state generators. Of more currency is what was and wasn't
done in the last 12 months to fan that spark into a uncontrolled, and perhaps
uncontrollable, firestorm.
Gov. Gray Davis once said that he was approaching energy just as he plays
golf, "one hole at a time." Unfortunately for Davis, and for the state, it
was not a golf game, but one of three-dimensional, and perhaps
four-dimensional, chess. To manage the crisis effectively, the Democratic
governor needed the ability, either personally or through trusted aides, to
pull together its disparate elements into a cohesive whole.
The golfing approach was evident from the beginning, as Davis dealt with only
the most immediate aspects of the situation as they evolved, rather than
embracing it wholly and actively. Private and public energy experts warned
that what was happening in San Diego was a harbinger of a larger crisis and
proposed that the 1996 "deregulation" be suspended, that rates be raised
slightly and that private utilities be given broad authority to enter into
long-term supply contracts to stabilize the market. But Davis and his
handpicked state Public Utilities Commission president, Loretta Lynch,
stalled for time.
Less than a month after the crisis first surfaced, the PUC voted 3-2 to
authorize long-term supply contracts at about 5 cents a kilowatt-hour --
slightly higher than wholesale prices had been, but ridiculously cheap by
contemporary standards. Publicly owned utilities saw the looming price
escalation and quickly locked up long-term supplies, but Lynch denounced the
commission action as "a wrong turn" that could lead to higher consumer bills,
and within days it was scuttled in legislation signed by Davis.
Rather than face the issue comprehensively and proactively, Davis, Lynch and
the Legislature opted for an expedient fix in San Diego, rolling back retail
rates without addressing either supply or cost issues. Within weeks, private
utilities were beginning to take on billions of dollars in debt as wholesale
costs skyrocketed.
Last summer's failure to act was compounded by other errors of judgment. It's
clear now, for example, that it was a mistake for the state to continue
buying power at sky-high rates when the utilities had exhausted their credit.
Having a new deep pocket encouraged the generators to charge whatever the
market would bear.
A year after he could have nipped the crisis in the bud, but didn't, Davis is
busily rewriting history and blaming others, principally Republicans, for the
dilemma. But the governor cannot, or should not, escape the responsibility
for approaching this very complex situation like a game of golf, or like some
routine political dispute, and thus failing to apply the aggressive and
sophisticated managerial touch that this crisis demanded from the onset.
As Gen. George McClellan discovered at the Battle of Antietam during the
Civil War, the unwillingness to take risk often leads to greater carnage.

Daniel Weintraub: Energy crisis sapping California's confidence


(Published May 22, 2001)

California's energy crisis is becoming a crisis of confidence. As electricity
rates rise and blackouts mount, residents are losing faith in their
government's ability to deal with the one issue underlying this crisis and
almost everything else that happens in the state -- population growth.
Energy and growth, in fact, are intertwined in the minds of everyday
Californians to an extent not yet reflected in the debate inside the Capitol,
according to the results of a new poll from the Public Policy Institute of
California.
More than three-quarters of those surveyed statewide said they believe
population growth contributed to the electricity shortage. And even if the
energy crisis fades, people expect other problems associated with growth to
worsen.
The crisis, in other words, has only heightened a sense that many people
already had, a feeling that California's famous quality of life is threatened
by rapid growth and our failure to provide the public works and services
needed to make growth tolerable.
For the first time since the mid-1990s, more people say the state is headed
in the wrong direction (48 percent) than in the right direction (44 percent).
And 56 percent said they expect bad economic times in the year ahead. That's
a quick decline from January, when a majority said they thought the state was
on the right track and 62 percent expected good economic times ahead.
"There is some deep-seated anxiety about the way government works, the way we
plan for the future, the way we make law, the way big decisions are made by
the governor and the Legislature," said Mark Baldassare, a Public Policy
Institute researcher who conducted the poll. "People didn't have a great deal
of confidence in local and state government to begin with, and now they have
even less."
Asked to cite the most important problem facing the state, 43 percent named
energy. But fully one-quarter of those surveyed said growth or related
problems -- the environment, housing, and transportation -- were on the top
of their list. Just 6 percent named schools as the top problem, a big drop
from a year ago, and the same number cited the economy. Other perennial
favorites -- crime, health care, taxes -- barely registered on the scale.
By a wide margin, Californians view growth as inevitable, but that doesn't
mean they have to like it. More than 8 in 10 said the state's anticipated
climb from 34 million people to 45 million by 2020 will make California a
less desirable place to live.
Six in 10 said traffic congestion is already a big problem in their
community, and 23 percent said it was somewhat of a problem. Nearly
three-quarters said the availability of housing was a problem. Sixty-four
percent said air pollution was a problem, and 61 percent complained about the
lack of opportunity for well-paying jobs.
The poll's respondents were conflicted about how best to deal with these
problems. A large majority favored local control rather than letting the
state taking a more active role in guiding growth and development. Yet an
astounding 89 percent said local governments in a region should work together
rather than each city and county deciding growth issues on its own.
But in a reflection of their lack of confidence in government, 63 percent
said local citizens should make growth decisions by voting on ballot
initiatives, while 35 percent said it would be better for local officials to
make those calls after thorough planning reviews and public hearings. A
little more than half -- 51 percent -- said they would vote today for an
initiative to slow the pace of development in their community even if it
meant having less economic growth.
What does all this mean for the political world? It's been clear for months
that the energy crisis was sapping Gov. Gray Davis' popularity in the state,
and this poll confirms that trend. Six in 10 say they disapprove of the way
Davis has handled the energy crisis, and his overall approval rating has
slipped to 46 percent, from 63 percent in January.
Conventional wisdom has been that if Davis could somehow find his way through
the energy crisis, he still could cruise to re-election. But that may no
longer be the case. Sixty-seven percent of residents say the crisis has made
them less confident in the state government's ability to plan for the future.
Gone is the optimism Californians once had that growth would produce a more
vibrant economy and make life better for us all.
Californians have a vaguely uneasy feeling that things are slipping out of
control, that no one really has a grip on where this state is going and how
we are going to get there. The energy crisis is only the most vivid example
of our failure to cope with change. People are worried. Davis should be, too.

Panel pulls the plug on county utility plan



Backers blame SDG&E for bill's demise in Assembly committee
By Bill Ainsworth
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- An Assembly committee yesterday thwarted a bipartisan effort to
ease the way for San Diego County to form a municipal utility district that
backers say would bring residents cheaper and more reliable power.
Proponents of the plan said San Diego Gas & Electric and its parent company,
Sempra, engineered a political power play that ensured defeat of the
proposal. The utility was the main opponent.
"Their lobbyists just got on this thing and killed it," said Bill Horn,
chairman of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors, who attended
yesterday's hearing before the Assembly Utilities and Commerce Committee.
"They did a tremendous disservice to residents of San Diego County."

But a lobbyist for Sempra told the committee that forming a municipal utility
wouldn't solve the energy crisis because it would do nothing to increase the
supply of electricity.
"We're not in the middle of a utility crisis," said lobbyist Cindy Howell.
"It's a generation crisis."
The bill, which would have applied only to San Diego County, had strong
bipartisan support from local officials, including state Sens. Steve Peace,
D-El Cajon, and Dede Alpert, D-Coronado, who took the unusual step of
personally testifying before an Assembly committee.

But the proposal earned just three of the 10 votes needed to clear the
committee. All of the votes came from Republicans.
The bill's author, Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido, blasted the
stockholder-owned utility company for opposing the bill.
"They simply don't want a threat to their ability to make as much money as
they can on the backs of San Diego ratepayers," he said.
Proponents say forming a public utility would allow residents to tap cheaper
sources of power, especially future hydroelectric power planned by the San
Diego County Water Authority.
They argue that controlling some power plants could reduce the county's
dependence on expensive electricity now purchased by SDG&E on the wholesale
market. That, in turn, could lead to lower utility bills.
During the current energy crisis, communities with publicly owned power,
including Los Angeles and Sacramento, have paid much lower energy bills than
communities served by investor-owned utilities.
But current state law makes it difficult to create a local municipal utility
because it requires a majority of voters to endorse the plan in an election
in which at least two-thirds of registered voters turn out.
As a practical matter, that means approval likely would occur only during a
presidential election when voter interest is high.
Peace said the current law was written for a reason: to protect privately
owned utilities.
"The law was written on purpose by this Legislature to make it almost
impossible to form a municipal utility district," he said.
Wyland's legislation, Assembly Bill 206, would have changed the law to allow
majority-vote approval in the new district, without regard to how many voters
turn out.
A proposal to create a municipal utility would have to go through months of
local hearings before it could be placed on the ballot. Wyland said he didn't
expect the new agency to replace SDG&E but merely to give residents more
options over the long term.
Initially, Sempra opposed the bill because it would have given the new public
agency the power of eminent domain to take over transmission lines and other
facilities owned by SDG&E.
At the hearing yesterday, Wyland offered to strip eminent domain power from
the new agency.
But Howell, the Sempra representative, still opposed the plan and argued that
there is no reason to change the voting requirement in the current law.
Forming a utility district, she said, is a significant step that should
require high voter turnout.
The bill also drew opposition from unionized employees of Sempra.
Committee chairman Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, voted against the bill, saying
it was vague and that San Diego legislators should get a better idea of what
they want to do.
He left open the possibility that he would support a proposal to allow the
county to buy power but not to form its own utility.
Wright, widely considered an ally of the privately owned utilities, received
$16,500 last year in contributions from Sempra, according to the Secretary of
State's Web site.
Other members of the committee objected to the proposed structure of the new
utility, which would be governed by a nine-member board of two supervisors,
two San Diego City Council members, three council members from county cities
and two public members.
The proposal seemed to turn the political parties' positions on public power
upside down.
The measure failed to win any votes from Democrats, who enthusiastically
endorsed a new state power authority that allows California to finance, buy
and seize power plants.
But the plan was supported by three Republicans, including Assemblymen Jay La
Suer of La Mesa, David Kelley of Idyllwild and Bill Leonard of Rancho
Cucamonga. Republicans opposed the state power authority, with some calling
it socialism.
Wyland said he may try to resurrect the proposal later in the year.







Business customers criticize proposed 29% SDG&E rate hike



By Craig D. Rose
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
SDG&E's commercial customers are attacking the prospect of paying an average
of 29 percent more to cover the state's soaring cost of buying electricity.
At a California Public Utilities Commission hearing in San Diego yesterday,
some business customers also noted the irony that only in February did they
win the same rate freeze as residential customers.
"We need rates we can depend on," said John Roberts, who owns an irrigation
products business in San Marcos.
SDG&E customers were the first to bear the brunt of deregulation, and the
utility's residential ratepayers were the first to win a reprieve when the
state capped rates at 6.5 cents per kilowatt-hour.
The SDG&E cap is expected to end for all customers in the coming weeks as the
commission moves to increase SDG&E's rates to levels now paid by customers of
PG&E and Edison, which are about 3 cents per kilowatt-hour higher.
Yesterday's hearing, however, was for commercial rates.
Roberts said his San Marcos-based irrigation products company has withstood a
tripling of power costs over the past year, while having to cut the cost of
its products because of competition, he said.
Roberts added that socking businesses with high costs in order to spare
residential electricity customers from expected rate hikes could be
counterproductive.
"If businesses leave the state, they'll be without jobs, and a $30 savings on
their power bills won't mean much," Roberts said.
The hearing at the County Administration Building was attended by about 30
people. An additional hearing is scheduled at 7 p.m. today in the Community
Rooms at the Oceanside Civic Center, 330 N. Coast Highway.
Larger crowds are expected for hearings on residential rate increases. Dates
for those hearings have not been set.







State sends $533.2 million to company, part of April bill



By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- One of the biggest single checks ever issued by the state of
California, $533.2 million, went to an Atlanta-based firm Friday for power
purchased for California utility customers during a single month, April.
Mirant, formerly Southern Energy, says more than half of the power came from
three plants in the San Francisco Bay Area that it purchased from Pacific Gas
and Electric for $801 million under a failed deregulation plan.
State Treasurer Kathleen Connell, who displayed a blown-up copy of the check
at a news conference yesterday, said she thinks the state has failed to
obtain enough cheap long-term power contracts and will have to borrow more
than the $13.4 billion planned.
Connell, an elected official who issues state checks, said the power bills
she had paid by last Thursday, totaling $5.1 billion, provide no basis for
assuming that the price of electricity "is dropping and that it will continue
to drop through the summer."
But a consultant for Gov. Gray Davis said the state, which has more long-term
contracts than Connell has seen, is on track to control power costs with the
aid of conservation and that it plans to meet its goals without additional
borrowing.
"I think the public should have confidence that this is not a rosy scenario,"
said Joseph Fichera of Saber Partners, a Davis consultant. "It's the expected
scenario."
The state plans to issue a bond of up to $13.4 billion in late August that
will repay the general-fund taxpayer money used for power purchases, about $7
billion so far. The bond will be paid off over 15 years by utility customers.
Davis has declined to reveal details of state spending for power, arguing
that the information would be used by power suppliers to submit higher bids.
A group of newspapers and Republican legislators have filed lawsuits to force
disclosure.
Connell said she has received 25 contracts from 17 power suppliers. She
declined to release details of the contracts, saying they are complicated and
have varying prices.
Connell said the check for $533,181,235 issued to Mirant Friday is one of the
largest she has written since taking office in 1995.
"This purchase was made entirely at spot-market prices," Connell said, "even
though the Department of Water Resources (the state agency that purchases
power) has an executed long-term contract with this company."
Mirant said in a statement that, at the request of the state, its marketing
arm gave the state a "helping hand" by buying power from suppliers not
willing to sell to the state and then reselling the power to the state.
"We've done the state a tremendous service in purchasing power on its
behalf," said Randy Harrison, Mirant's Western chief executive officer, "and
it's wrong for the transactions to be misinterpreted and skewed in a negative
light."
Mirant said its subsidiaries generated 1.377 million megawatt-hours in April,
while its marketing arm purchased enough additional electricity to boost the
total sold to the state during the month to 2.077 million megawatt-hours.
The firm said the power was sold for an average of $256.87 per megawatt-hour.
That's below the $346 average that the state expects to pay on the expensive
spot market during the second quarter of this year, from April through June.
But it's well above the average price of $69 per megawatt-hour said to have
been obtained in the first round of long-term contracts negotiated by the
state.
Mirant purchased three power plants from PG&E capable of producing 3,000
megawatts during a controversial part of deregulation. The state Public
Utilities Commission ordered utilities to sell off at least half of their
fossil-fuel power plants without requiring the purchasers to provide low-cost
power to California.
The utilities sold nearly two dozen major power plants capable of producing
more than 20,000 megawatts. The largest group of plants, 4,700 megawatts,
went to AES Corp. of Virginia. Three Texas firms purchased plants producing
7,000 megawatts.
The power supply situation in California remained sound enough yesterday to
ward off blackouts, although temperatures are on the rise throughout the
state. More heat means more air conditioning, and a greater strain on the
system.
But starting next month, the state's electricity grid managers plan to
provide businesses and consumers with better forecasts of potential rolling
blackouts.
The California Independent System Operator will post on its Web site "power
warnings" when there is at least a 50 percent chance that rolling blackouts
might be required during the next 24 hours. The ISO will issue a "power
watch" when less-critical shortages are anticipated in advance of high demand
days.
The agency also plans to give a 30-minute warning before it orders utilities
to cut power to customers, posting information about probable interruptions
on its Web site. Its Web site address is http://www.caiso.com
"There have been a number of requests from businesses and consumers alike
that would like more advance notice and to be able to plan better. That's
what we are trying to do," ISO spokeswoman Lorie O'Donley said.
O'Donley said many details about how notifications will occur still have to
be worked out, including whether e-mails or pagers might be used.
In other developments in the electricity crisis:
About 1.5 million compact fluorescent light bulbs will be distributed to
375,000 households as part of the "Power Walk" program that began during the
weekend. Members of the California Conservation Corps are going door-to-door
in parts of some cities to distribute the bulbs as part of a $20 million
conservation program.
Republican legislative leaders sent Davis a letter criticizing the governor
for using taxpayer funds to hire two aides to former Vice President Al Gore
as communication consultants for $30,000 a month. The Republicans said Mark
Fabiani and Chris Lehane operate "a partisan, cut-throat political
communications firm."
The state Auditor General said in a report on energy deregulation that the
state is not meeting some of its goals for conservation and for building new
power plants. The auditor also said the PUC does not have a process for
quickly approving new transmission lines. The state has been importing about
20 percent of its power.

75% say power woes 'very serious'



By John Marelius
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 22, 2001
The overwhelming majority of Californians now regard the state's electricity
crisis as a serious problem, but say they have not yet been greatly
inconvenienced by it, a new Field Poll has found.
The nonpartisan statewide survey found that while people believe the
electricity problem is real, they believe it stems more from an attempt by
energy companies to drive rates up than from an actual shortage.
They are also far more worried about soaring electricity bills than the
threat of blackouts.
And Californians offered contradictory views as to whether electricity
conservation can head off blackouts this summer. They believe all electricity
consumers -- residents, businesses and government -- can reduce their usage
enough to avert blackouts. But they also say they already have cut back their
own usage about as much as they can.
In January, the Field Poll surveyed public attitudes about the growing
electricity crisis. At the time, 58 percent characterized the situation as
"very serious." Now, the percentage of the population that considers the
situation "very serious" has grown to 75 percent.
Californians also hold a rather cynical view of the crisis. Thirty-six
percent say they believe it is the consequence of an electricity shortage,
but 59 percent say it was caused by energy companies seeking to increase
profits.
The Field Poll is based on telephone interviews with 1,015 California adults
conducted between May 11 and Sunday. According to statistical theory, the
poll would be accurate 95 percent of the time within a margin of error of 3.2
percentage points.
So far, the ill effects of the electricity crisis are ones Californians seem
to be willing to live with. But they worry that will not be the case much
longer.
Eleven percent said they had been inconvenienced "a great deal" by blackouts.
But looking toward the summer, 34 percent said they expected blackouts to be
a major inconvenience.
Likewise, 19 percent said the electricity rate increases averaging 10 percent
that have taken effect have been a very serious problem for them. If rates
were to go up another 10 percent, 36 percent would regard that as a serious
problem.
Opinion is divided over the merits of recent rate increases approved by the
state Public Utilities Commission. Forty-one percent called them justified
and 52 percent called them unjustified.
"It's not overwhelmingly panned, which I suppose is about as well as could be
expected on an issue like this," said Mark DiCamillo, associate director of
the Field Poll. "It's almost like a tax increase. The public doesn't want it;
it's just whether they think it's justified or not."
Looking ahead, 28 percent say blackouts are the greatest threat posed by the
electricity crisis. But more than twice as many, 67 percent, say they are
more concerned about escalating electricity bills.
By a significant ratio, 61 percent to 34 percent, Californians believe
additional conservation measures by all electricity users can eliminate the
need for summer blackouts.
But when it comes to their own electricity consumption, they say they already
have cut back significantly and can't do much more.
Californians say they have reduced their household electricity usage by an
average of 8 percent. They said they could cut back by another 4 percent in
their homes without causing serious problems.
"If the state is looking and the governor is looking for redoubled efforts,
it's going to be painful because the public thinks we can do a little bit
more, but not a lot," said DiCamillo.






Governor told to try seizure in power war



By Philip J. LaVelle
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
May 19, 2001
A major San Diego business group urged Gov. Gray Davis yesterday to take
emergency steps in the energy crisis, including seizing power plants -- an
action the governor said may be in the cards.
Davis met over lunch for nearly two hours with members of the San Diego
Building Owners and Managers Association, overseers of about 250 commercial
properties here.
The meeting, at the University Club at Symphony Towers downtown, was closed
to the media.

In remarks to reporters later, Davis repeated his hard line against
out-of-state energy producers, relating a threat made to a dozen power
executives in a private meeting May 9.

"I told the generators face to face, as close as I am to you ...
'Gentlemen, you are going to lose your plants, and I'm going to sign a
windfall-profits tax, unless you help us get through this summer without
blackouts and without staggering prices.'"
Davis also said he told them: "You know you've been ripping us off, acting in
a predatory manner. If you do it this summer, you leave me no choice but to
take your plants and sign a windfall-profits tax. So the ball is in your
court, gentlemen."
Building association executive Craig Benedetto said the group had "a frank
exchange" with Davis. "We want to do our fair share (on conservation), but
we're also concerned about the supply side," he said. The group "strongly
urged him to use his emergency powers to do whatever is necessary, including
seizing plants."
Association President Cybele Thompson said Davis asked for a string of
conservation measures. Yet some cannot be implemented without state
intervention, she said. For example, Davis urged that air-conditioning
thermostats be set at 78 degrees, but "a lot of our leases don't permit it,"
she said.
While in San Diego, Davis received an honorary doctor of science degree from
Scripps Research Institute.






Head of PUC unveils evidence of power plant manipulation



ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 19, 2001
LOS ANGELES ) The head of the California Public Utilities Commission provided
a state Senate committee with evidence showing three power generators reduced
electricity production and then benefited from the resulting high prices.
While testifying before the committee Friday, PUC President Loretta Lynch
displayed charts that tracked electricity prices and power generation at
three plants on a single day last November.
According to the graphs, after the plants reduced production during the
middle of the day, the state was forced to declare two separate power
emergencies which indicate electricity reserves had fallen seriously low.
After the shortfall in supply helped cause a spike in prices, the companies
operating the three plants suddenly increased their electricity production to
almost full capacity, allowing them to capitalize on the much higher rates.
"We certainly see a pattern," Lynch told the committee, which is
investigating alleged manipulation of the state's wholesale power market by
energy suppliers. "Many generators are playing on their experience and
playing, to an extent, California."
Maintenance records reviewed by investigators show that there were no valid
reasons for the plants to cut back production, Lynch said.
She would not identify the power plants involved, however, Lynch did say that
they are owned by at least two companies.
Sen. Joseph Dunn, who heads the special committee investigating alleged
market manipulation, said Lynch's testimony, on its face, is "very damning."
He said his committee has uncovered additional preliminary evidence showing
that several power companies have allegedly engaged in similar behavior.
During a break in Friday's hearing, a spokeswoman for a trade group of major
power suppliers told the Los Angeles Times that there have been no
coordinated efforts to shrink supplies to increase profits.
"There has been no collusion," said Jean Muoz of the Independent Energy
Producers Association.
The PUC and state Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer are jointly investigating the
exorbitant wholesale power prices that have cost California billions and
brought major utilities to financial ruin.







State to Issue Warnings of Power Outages
Electricity: Cal-ISO says it will try to give residents and businesses
24-hour notice of probable blackouts.

By MIGUEL BUSTILLO and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers

Californians will hear an expanded forecast on their morning commutes
this summer, courtesy of the energy crisis: "The 405 Freeway is jammed,
there's a slim chance of showers, and oh, by the way, there's a 50%
likelihood of blackouts."
By the end of this month, the California Independent System Operator,
the agency that manages the state's power grid, expects to issue 24-hour
forecasts generally detailing when and where blackouts can be expected.
It is also piecing together a high-tech system to give businesses,
government officials and the public at least a half-hour notice of a probable
blackout in their area.
Just how those notices will be issued remains somewhat up in the air,
but Cal-ISO is talking with private companies capable of notifying more than
10,000 customers a minute via fax and phone, and millions a minute via
wireless communications such as pagers.
Cal-ISO assembled the plan after complaints from businesses,
particularly those in the Silicon Valley, that last-minute blackouts were
costing California millions. The plan also responds to growing political
pressure for the public to be kept informed of the barrage of outages that is
expected to darken the state this summer because of insufficient supplies of
electricity.
If Californians' electricity use pattern is similar to last year's,
Cal-ISO has projected, the state could suffer 34 days of blackouts, making
increased notification crucial.
With a shortage of hydroelectric power imports from the drought-stricken
Pacific Northwest, and no new power plants coming online until July, the
agency calculates that there will be a supply-demand gap in June of 3,700
megawatts--enough power to supply 2.8 million homes. A national utility
industry group painted a more dire scenario last week when it predicted that
California will experience up to 260 hours of blackouts this summer.
"The weather report and traffic report are good analogies; people know
they are not 100% accurate, but if [a blackout] really means a lot to them,
they will check in," said Mike Florio of the Utility Reform Network, who
serves on the Cal-ISO board.
Details remain sketchy, and the programs may be altered when the board
meets Thursday. But a Web page called "Today's Outlook" on the agency's
Internet site, www.caiso.com, will be created to illustrate, hour by hour,
how much electricity is available during a 24-hour period and whether there
is a predicted surplus or shortfall.
Media outreach will be expanded to provide news bulletins on electricity
conditions a day in advance. They will not only include demand projections
and the effects of weather, but they also will define the level of emergency
that is expected.
A "power watch" will be sounded during stage 1 and stage 2 shortages,
and a more serious "power warning" if there is a 50-50 chance of a stage 3,
which often results in blackouts. (Stage 1 emergencies occur when power
reserves drop below 7%, stage 2 5% and stage 3 1.5%.)
Most important, Cal-ISO is pledging to provide 30-minute notice of
probable blackouts to people in the areas served by Pacific Gas & Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric, among others. In
addition to giving the warnings on the Internet and through the mass media,
Cal-ISO will sound alarms to select e-mail addresses and pager numbers on
"blast lists," or massive computer databases that it will assemble.
"The technology is there. This is a war California is in, and we should
be deploying high-tech solutions," said Carl Guardino of the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, the Cal-ISO board member who had been pushing hardest
for better notification. "Every time California goes black, the economy sees
red."
Guardino said that businesses and public agencies are now receiving just
two- to six-minute warnings before blackouts, not nearly enough to react.
"A two-minute warning may be sufficient in a football game, but it is
insufficient to protect California businesses and the public," he said.
Though businesses and government agencies are expected to make the most
of the warnings, Florio said residents also will benefit.
"It will be more of a challenge to get the information to individual
homeowners, but if someone works at home, and sets it up to get an e-mail
notice, they can take advantage," he said.
In other energy news Monday, the woman in charge of paying California's
power bills warned that a $13.4-billion bond issue to cover electricity
purchases will be insufficient and that the state will have to borrow $4
billion more before it runs out of cash in February.
Calling a news conference in the capital, state Controller Kathleen
Connell questioned the key assumptions underpinning Gov. Gray Davis'
financial plan for overcoming the energy crisis. The plan assumes the $13.4
billion in bond sales will repay state coffers for electricity purchases and
cover future power buys for the next two years.
Connell's opinion is notable because, as the state's chief check writer,
the independently elected Democrat is privy to information about the prices
the state is paying for electricity bought on the spot market and through
long-term contracts--data that Davis has largely kept secret.
Davis' advisors and Department of Finance officials dispute Connell's
warnings.







Businesses May Seek Blackout Exemption
Energy: PUC will accept new applications, which would be granted only to
minimize danger to public health and safety.

By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Times Staff Writer


The San Francisco Giants want one, and so presumably do most other
California businesses: an exemption from the rolling blackouts that experts
say are all but certain this summer.
But whether operating on a baseball diamond or in more mundane venues
far from the bright lights of pro sports, few businesses will be granted such
waivers--and then only to minimize threats to public health and safety--under
a process detailed Monday by the California Public Utilities Commission.
"It would be nice in a perfect world if we could exempt everyone who
asks from rolling blackouts. Unfortunately, we can't do that," Commissioner
Carl A. Wood said in announcing the procedure for applying for blackout
exemptions.
The PUC already exempts a fairly lengthy list of those whose services
are needed to protect public health and safety, including fire and police
stations and acute-care hospitals.
Energy experts are predicting blackouts this year ranging from a total
of 20 hours at the most optimistic to 200 hours or more, based on such
factors as historic patterns of electricity usage, forecasts for hot weather
and expectations of diminished hydroelectric imports from out of state.
Any new business exemptions, which would start no sooner than August,
would be granted only to minimize danger to public health and safety.
That means a business would not be granted an exemption from outages
just because it fears revenue loss, Wood said at a Los Angeles news
conference.
Residential customers will be unable to apply for the exemptions.
Nevertheless, many already enjoy blackout protection by quirk of location--if
they share a circuit with an exempt customer--or if they are customers of the
Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and municipal utilities such as
those in Glendale and Burbank that do not rely on the statewide power grid
for electricity.
The PUC can approve only a limited number of blackout exemptions, Wood
said, because to maintain system reliability, a pool of customers
representing at least 40% of total system load must be available for rolling
power outages.
Statewide, about 50% of system load is exempt from blackouts in the
territories served by the three big investor-owned utilities: Edison
International's Southern California Edison, PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &
Electric and Sempra Energy's San Diego Gas & Electric.
"This is not an exercise in determining who is most affected
economically by rolling blackouts. Everyone is affected economically by
rolling blackouts," Wood said.
The PUC has set up a Web site, www.rotating-outages.com, and toll-free
number, (888) 741-1106, for businesses seeking information and applications.
The deadline to apply is 5 p.m. June 1.
Completed applications will be reviewed by an engineering consulting
firm, Exponent Inc. of Menlo Park, Calif., which will develop a priority list
based on risk to public health and safety.
Only businesses that have applied would be considered for exemptions,
Wood said, explaining that the commission will not excuse entire industries.
The PUC is expected to vote on the exemptions by Aug. 2.
Wood said several companies already have applied, including the
operators of Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco, home of the Giants major
league baseball team.






Legislators Set to Sue Federal Energy Agency
Power: Lawmakers try a new idea: a lawsuit arguing that blackouts pose danger
to people, law enforcement and even water supply

By DAN MORAIN, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--Legislative Democrats today will sue federal energy
regulators, charging that their inaction threatens elderly people in nursing
homes, children in day care centers, law enforcement and its ability to fight
crime, and the state's drinking water supplies.
Rather than focus on record wholesale energy costs, the lawsuit takes a
new tack, homing in on the threat to health and safety posed by California's
energy crisis and the blackouts likely this summer.
A draft of the suit seeks to force the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission to set "just and reasonable" wholesale power rates as a way of
ending the crisis before blackouts occur. The action is being filed by
veteran trial attorney Joe Cotchett on behalf of Senate President Pro Tem
John Burton (D-San Francisco), Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg (D-Sherman
Oaks), and the city of Oakland.
"A crisis of unprecedented dimensions is already taking shape in
California," the draft says. "The public health, safety and welfare of the
state's 34 million residents is in jeopardy due to the tragic consequences of
rolling blackouts and punitive prices."

Suit Says Blackouts Pose Threats
Until now, most California officials, including Gov. Gray Davis, have
been urging that the regulatory commission cap wholesale power prices as a
way of limiting costs to the state, which has spent more than $6 billion
buying electricity since January.
In the lawsuit, Cotchett will be arguing that while higher bills will
stretch the budgets of people on fixed incomes, frail elderly people "are
left to wonder if their oxygen tanks, drip IVs, dialysis machines and
electricity-powered therapeutic beds will respond when they are needed."
"Rolling blackouts represent more than just an annoyance for the men,
women and children with disabilities," the suit says. "They represent an
imminent threat to life, health and independence."
Cotchett said the suit will be filed in the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco, bypassing the federal trial court. Cotchett said
the circuit court has direct jurisdiction over FERC.
Joining Cotchett will be Clark Kelso, a professor at McGeorge Law School
in Sacramento who briefly was insurance commissioner last year after Chuck
Quackenbush resigned. Kelso said he initially was skeptical that lawmakers
had legal standing to sue. But after Cotchett spoke with him, Kelso said he
became convinced the suit had merit.
"Let's face it," said Kelso, a Republican, "this is the single most
important issue that the state faces for the next six months."

Watching the Water Supply
The suit cites warnings from governmental agencies about the
implications of blackouts, including one the state Department of Health
Services issued earlier this month to public water agencies statewide. The
warning contains a sample notice that local water authorities should give to
consumers.
"If the water looks cloudy or dirty," the warning says, "you should not
drink it." The warning suggests that if people are concerned about water
quality, they can boil it or add "eight drops of household bleach to one
gallon of water, and let it sit for 30 minutes."
Most water agencies have back-up generators. But the suit says that "if
an agency's water treatment facilities are hit by a power outage, a two-hour
blackout can result in two-day interruptions in providing safe drinking water
because of time needed to bring equipment back online and flush potentially
contaminated water from the system."





California will forecast blackouts and warn the public

(05-22) 00:05 PDT (AP) --
Eds.: PMs.
SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- The operator of California's electricity grid is
offering a partial answer to a major consumer complaint, planning to give the
public a half-hour's warning before shutting off the lights.
Beginning May 30, the Independent System Operator also plans to issue
warnings similar to weather advisories 24 hours before expected blackouts.
Up to now, the agency has refused to give more than a few minutes' warning,
saying it did not want to alarm people when there was still a chance that a
last-minute purchase of power could stave off blackouts. The utilities have
also resisted giving warnings, saying they did not want to tip off burglars
and other criminals.
"Definitely, it's a good idea," said Shirley Starr, a racetrack employee in
the Los Angeles suburb of Rosemead. "If I know it's going to happen, I won't
defrost the refrigerator or something."
Like some business customers and consumer groups, she wondered if 30 minutes
warning would be enough.
"A lot of people, if they are at work, a half hour isn't going to do any
good," Starr said.
"I think it should be more than 30 minutes," said George Aguilar, an animal
control officer in El Monte. "It should be at least eight hours."
Californians have been warned that rolling blackouts could be a regular
feature this summer. The state's power system, crippled by a botched effort
at deregulation, has been unable to produce or buy enough electricity to
power air conditioners on hot days.
The rolling blackouts move from neighborhood to neighborhood in a sequence
that is determined by the utilities and is difficult or impossible for the
public to predict. The outages last 60 to 90 minutes and then skip to another
neighborhood.
Because of the lack of notice, the six days of rolling blackouts to hit the
state so far this year have led to pileups at intersections suddenly left
without stoplights, trapped people in elevators, and caused business losses
by bringing production lines to a halt. People with home medical equipment
like oxygen fret they that they will be cut off without warning.
The new plan by the ISO borrows from the language of weather forecasters: It
will issue a "power watch" or "power warning" that will give notice the grid
could be headed toward blackouts.
The ISO will issue 30-minute warning to the media and others before any
blackouts actually begin. However, the ISO will not say what neighborhoods
will be hit.
"It's better than no notice," said John Handley of California Independent
Grocers.
He said stores could use the warning to rush customers through checkout and
even move items to cold storage if necessary.
"Once the power goes out, we can't ring anyone up," Handley said.
Many small factories have production lines that cannot be interrupted without
risk to an entire lot of whatever they produce, said Brad Ward, president and
chief executive of the Small Manufacturers Association of California.
For example, a manufacturer might be using acid to etch something on a piece
of metal. If power is shut off suddenly, the acid might not be removed in
time and the piece would be ruined.
"This is really, really good news," Ward said.
The ISO said it also is looking into high-tech ways it can get word of an
impending blackout quickly to homeowners and businesses through mass e-mails,
faxes, automated phone calls and pager messages.

As discussed with you last week, Governor Pataki is holding a fundraiser for
his reelection campaign in Houston on Monday, June 4th. (His current terrm
expires in 2002.) According to the fundraiser organizing this event,
Elizabeth Blakemore (713-526-3399), there will be a reception from 5-6:30
p.m. at the home of Judy and Jack Holmes in River Oaks, followed by a dinner
at 7 for approximately 20 people at a location to be determined. Governor
Perry will be attending the reception, but not the dinner. All proceeds from
the fundraiser will go to the Pataki campaign. Tickets to the dinner are
$5,000.00 per person.

When I spoke with Blakemore last week, she indicated that the event was being
chaired by Bill Wise from El Paso, but she was willing to figure out a way to
get Ken or Jeff equal billing. She indicated that they do not yet have a
location for the dinner and suggested that it might be hosted in Ken or
Jeff's home. She also suggested that if we were willing to commit to $25,000,
we should be given co-chair status and would check with Pataki's office to
confirm that. I spoke with Blakemore today (5/11) and she confirmed that we
would definitely be given co-chair status for a $25k contribution. (She noted
that there may in fact be one or two others as well.)

I recommend that we co-host the event. As Rick correctly noted, we don't have
much of a relationship with Pataki, and this would give us a chance to begin
to establish closer ties with him. As you may be aware, NY law limits
corporate donations to NY candidates in any one year to $5,000.00 in the
aggregate. However, every individual corporation is allowed to make a
separate $5,000.00 contribution.

For the time being, I asked Blakemore to use me as her contact person. But it
makes sense to get her hooked up with someone in Houston. Let me know how you
want to proceed.

GAS DAILY
ON-LINE EDITION
May 15, 2001
***FERC launches formal hearing in El Paso case
A collection of high-powered attorneys crowded a FERC hearing
room yesterday for the launch of a formal hearing into
allegations of market power abuse by El Paso and its affiliates.
While a decision is still a way off, the presiding judge in the case
made it clear that FERC must find a precise way to measure market
share in California before ruling on the case.
The hearing also marked the public release of a controversial
market power study by The Brattle Group, which was commissioned
by Southern California Edison to find evidence of market power
abuse by El Paso marketing affiliate El Paso Merchant Energy. The
Brattle Group said that it found substantial evidence that El Paso
manipulated California's gas market -- a claim that remains
strongly in dispute (see story, page 4).
In an opening statement, FERC Chief Administrative Law Judge
Curtis Wagner laid down the parameters for the hearing. The
burden of proof, he said, is on the California Public Utilities
Commission, which filed the original Section 5 complaint against
El Paso. But once a case is made, Wagner added, "the burden of
going forward with evidence to rebut that case shifts to El Paso
Merchant and the parties on its side of the table."
The case originated last year, when the CPUC asked FERC to
abrogate a series of transportation contracts between El Paso
Natural Gas and El Paso Merchant. The California regulators
claimed the capacity award was rigged, and further complained of
a conspiracy to drive up the delivered price of gas into California.
In March, FERC dismissed the CPUC's claim that there was
favoritism in the bidding process for El Paso pipeline capacity (GD
3/29). But the commission also sent the case before an ALJ, saying
the case raised larger questions of market power. According to
FERC, certain disputed issues of fact need to be examined at a
hearing before a decision can be rendered.
One of the biggest issues will be determining whether the
affected market is the entire state of California or whether it is
just Southern California. The CPUC and Southern California Edison
maintain that only the Southern California market is at issue,
while El Paso argues that the case applies to the entire state.
The outcome of the case could hinge on that distinction. As
Wagner noted in his opening remarks, "The question of the
geographic market makes a tremendous difference in how El Paso
Merchant's market share will be measured and the results."
If the entire state is considered as a single market, said
Wagner, then El Paso Merchant would have a market share that,
depending on methodology, would range between 17% and 26.8%.
But if the CPUC's contention that the market is Southern
California holds up, he added, then El Paso Merchant's market
share would be between 35% and 44.9%.
Finding out whether market power exists also depends on how
many players are involved in a particular market. Wagner said
that the parties need to reach a stipulation among counsel on the
number of players. In addition, he said that he would need a better
geographic description of El Paso Merchant's capacity holdings
and information on the price differential of gas between Northern
and Southern California.
Finally, Wagner directed a number of questions to El Paso. El
Paso Merchant, he said, "should answer the CPUC's question as to
why it subscribed for the involved [1.2 billion cfd] for 15 months
when it had no market for that amount." In addition, said Wagner,
El Paso should "show whether it sold in the secondary market
short-term releases of the excess [capacity] at a price higher than
it paid."
Wagner also heard arguments over the admissibility of certain
evidence.
Given the volume of testimony involved, the case will require
some legal heavy lifting before a preliminary decision is reached.
Noting that he received a nearly two-foot high stack of testimony
last week, Wagner said that reading prehearing briefs and
prepared testimony "consumed a very beautiful Sunday in
Washington." (RP00-241)     NH

***El Paso takes aim at Calif. Assembly, study
In an effort to clear its name in the ongoing California market
power controversy, El Paso is going on the offensive. The company
yesterday issued a riposte to claims -- publicized by California
Assembly members and major newspapers -- that it manipulated
California gas prices. And it took close aim at The Brattle Group, a
consultancy that has figured prominently in various
investigations into the matter.
According to El Paso, The Brattle Group worked "hand-in-hand"
with a California Assembly subcommittee to pin the blame on El
Paso and its subsidiaries for the run-up in gas prices in the
Golden State. El Paso furnished copies of internal Assembly e-mails
as proof that the subcommittee did not seek to conduct an
objective investigation.
As reported in Gas Daily, The Brattle Group's study of alleged
market power abuse by El Paso marketing arm El Paso Merchant
Energy has been exhibit A in California pipeline litigation (GD
4/25). In a study commissioned by Southern California Edison, The
Brattle Group concluded that El Paso had deliberately manipulated
California-bound pipeline capacity in an effort to drive up the
price differential between production basins and the California
border.
Drawing in large part on The Brattle Group's opinion, the
California Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight recently
concluded that El Paso caused the price run-up (GD 4/20).
Representatives of the Assembly's Democratic majority said The
Brattle Group study proved conclusively that the rise in gas
prices at the California border was greater than could be
accounted for through normal market forces.
But according to El Paso, the subcommittee majority was --
deliberately -- wrong. The inquiry conducted by the subcommittee,
said El Paso, was a "charade that was orchestrated from the
beginning" to shore up SoCalEd's case.
"El Paso has recently obtained, through discovery in a
proceeding before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
correspondence between the staff for the subcommittee and the
paid litigation consultant [The Brattle Group] for Southern
California Edison," said El Paso in a statement. "This
communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's
conclusions were pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's
failed energy policies."
The correspondence included apparent requests from
subcommittee staff members for help in "rebutting" El Paso's
testimony before the Assembly. El Paso interpreted those requests
as proof that the subcommittee majority "never intended" to write
an objective report on the matter.
"We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its
responsibilities to [SoCalEd's] consultants," said Norma Dunn, El
Paso senior vice president of communications and government
affairs. "We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff and testified
before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we
learn that the subcommittee was working at the direction of
[SoCalEd's] litigation consultants to support SCE's litigation
position."
Litigation pitting SoCalEd and the California Public Utilities
Commission against El Paso is currently under way at FERC (see
story, page 1). Following yesterday's hearing, Dunn told Gas Daily
that SoCalEd and the CPUC were also waging their campaign against
El Paso in the   national press.
The New York Times, for instance, has published articles that
relied on The Brattle Group study and other sealed documents.
Dunn said it was "clear" that SoCalEd and the CPUC were using the
selective leak of documents to take the case against El Paso to the
public.
Prior to recess in yesterday's hearing, FERC Chief
Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner issued a reminder of the
need to restrict access to protected documents.     NH

El Paso Calls California Subcommittee Hearing a 'Sham'
El Paso Corp. claims it was set up by California Assembly members to take the
blame for high gas prices in the state. It said recent hearings before a
subcommittee were a "sham," and that it was "predetermined" that El Paso
would be accused on wrongdoing in a report approved by the subcommittee
majority yesterday.
While El Paso battled similar accusations at the opening of hearings
yesterday before a FERC administrative law judge, the company publicly
contested the results of the majority report (approved 3-2) of the California
Assembly Subcommittee on Energy Oversight, which placed the blame on the
energy company for skyrocketing gas prices in the state. The majority report
says El Paso drove up gas prices by withholding pipeline capacity from the
market, focusing on the same year-old capacity contract between El Paso's
pipeline and marketing affiliate that is the subject of FERC's investigation.
Contrary to the majority report, however, are the conclusions of a report
prepared for the two Republican members of the five-member subcommittee. That
document said the hearings "produced no conclusive evidence" of price
manipulation.
Although the majority report has not been made public, "it is clear, based on
accounts of the report and recently uncovered documents, that the
subcommittee hearing was a sham," El Paso said in a statement.
El Paso released to the public yesterday documents containing e-mail
correspondence between staff members of the subcommittee and members of the
Brattle Group, a paid consulting firm for Southern California Edison. The
Brattle Group is one of El Paso's main opponents at the hearings this week
before FERC's Chief Administrative Law Judge Curtis Wagner Jr. Brattle
accuses the company of costing Californians an additional $3.7 billion in gas
costs over the past year.
The correspondence El Paso released reveals a close relationship between the
consulting firm and the subcommittee staff. For example, a staff member said
to Brattle Group's Matthew O'Loughlin, "I can't thank you and Paul enough for
your testimony. It was beyond expectations, the members were highly
impressed. The chairman asked me if you guys could stay and help us with a
second day. We could have used it."
El Paso said the communication reveals that the subcommittee majority's
conclusions were "pre-determined to blame El Paso for California's failed
energy policies." The subcommittee majority was working "hand-in-hand with,
and relying on, SCE's consultant, the Brattle Group, in their so-called
analysis," El Paso said. "In communications between the subcommittee staff
and SCE's consultant, it is clear that SCE's consultant assisted in preparing
questions for the hearing and that the subcommittee staff requested
assistance from SCE's consultant in preparing the final report.
"That the subcommittee majority never intended to conduct an objective
investigation is clear... [R]ather than write an objective report based on
the testimony, the staff went on to ask SCE's consultant for help in
'rebutting' El Paso's testimony."
"We are shocked that the subcommittee delegated its responsibilities to SCE's
consultants," said Norma Dunn, senior vice president of Communications and
Government Affairs for El Paso. "We voluntarily met with subcommittee staff
and testified before the subcommittee in good faith, under the false premise
that the subcommittee was interested in seeking the truth. Now we learn that
the subcommittee was working at the direction of SCE's litigation consultants
to support SCE's litigation position. We are particularly concerned that
after coordinating the questions to be asked, the Brattle Group testified
before the subcommittee as if it were an independent group. It is obvious
that the subcommittee hearings were a charade that was orchestrated from the
beginning. Final conclusions were drawn before we had an opportunity to
testify and then the final report was leaked to the press instead of provided
to us, so that we would not have an opportunity to react."
Dunn said El Paso is confident that once the facts are presented to FERC in
hearings this week, it will be "vindicated."
However, El Paso also faces an uphill battle in Washington. The FERC hearings
pit El Paso and its subsidiaries against the California Public Utilities
Commission and the state's two largest investor-owned utilities, Pacific Gas
& Electric and Southern California Edison.
The regulators and the utilities also allege El Paso withheld capacity on its
pipelines into the state, which in turn pushed prices up. If the charges are
substantiated, FERC Judge Wagner could order the company to refund any money
it earned due to price or supply manipulation. Such a ruling could have even
broader implications because skyrocketing prices for natural gas, the single
biggest source of fuel for power plants in California, obviously contributed
to the financial calamity that brought Southern California Edison to its
knees and sent Pacific Gas & Electric into bankruptcy.
The details of the charges are well known at this point. Critics alleged that
El Paso Merchant Energy Gas LP and El Paso Merchant Energy Co. received
inside information on a discount transportation rate that enabled them to end
up the big winners in an open season in February of last year. The open
season involved 1.22 Bcf/d of firm capacity on El Paso to the California
border.
But in an order on complaint, FERC found "no merit in the allegations." It
cleared El Paso of charges that it rigged the bidding for capacity to favor
its affiliates. Moreover, it said there was no evidence that El Paso violated
its standards of conduct. However, the Commission did not dismiss the
allegations that El Paso engaged in market and price manipulation. It set the
market power issue for hearing in March before Judge Wagner and ordered him
to provide an initial decision within 60 days (see Daily GPI, March 29).
FERC staff also appears to be hot on El Paso's tracks. In testimony submitted
last week before Judge Wagner, FERC staff's expert witness concluded that El
Paso probably exercised market power in the Southern California gas market
and drove up gas prices over the past year when pipeline capacity constraints
existed. FERC Economist Dr. Jonathan D. Ogur concluded that under certain
circumstances El Paso was able to wield market power in the Southern
California gas market (see Daily GPI, May 14).
The rise in California natural gas prices is not attributable to El Paso, the
company said in its statement yesterday, but is attributable to the fact that
demand for gas has far outstripped supply. Evidence presented at the
California subcommittee hearings shows that El Paso has consistently utilized
its pipeline capacity to ship natural gas to California and has never
restricted supply. Constraints on gas infrastructure in the state have
limited the supply of gas during a time in which demand has risen
dramatically, the company said.

Budget plan shrinks: Davis responds to an uncertain economy but preserves a
boost in education funding.
By John Hill
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published May 15, 2001)
Gov. Gray Davis laid out his plan for coping with diminished revenues and
growing fiscal uncertainty Monday, slashing the state budget he proposed in
January while preserving much of the spending for education and public
safety.
"Every proposal I made was warranted, needed and, in some cases, long
overdue," Davis said. "But a budget by definition is the act of making
choices."
Davis' new proposal launches what is likely to be an intense month-and-a-half
struggle over the $103 billion budget for the fiscal year that begins July 1.
State revenue, which over the years has grown far more sensitive to economic
cycles, plunged with the stock market, leaving a $4.2 billion hole in the
January budget proposal.
For the first time in years, the governor and the Legislature must deal with
shrinking expectations, and it's happening during a period of intense
partisan bickering over the state energy crisis.
The revised budget proposal counts on the sale of bonds in August to repay
the state treasury for electricity purchases, which now total more than $7
billion. Davis admitted in announcing his new plan that the assumption is
risky and once again criticized Republicans for holding up a bill that would
have allowed an earlier bond sale.
"If anything else goes wrong, like a natural disaster or some precipitous
drop in the economy, then we could be in real trouble," he said.
Davis' plan depends on delaying for two years a commitment to shift sales tax
on gasoline from the state's general fund to a special fund dedicated to
transportation projects. The move, which would save $1.1 billion, is likely
to be opposed by Republicans, who fought for the shift.
Davis said his proposal would not delay transportation projects in the
pipeline because more money is available than is needed right now, but might
affect those that haven't been approved.
The revised budget proposal makes numerous cuts, with some one-time
expenditures eliminated altogether.
A $250 million payment to local governments to use as they see fit is gone.
So, too, is $200 million that would have rewarded cities and counties that
increased the number of housing permits they issued.
A $40 million pilot project for touch-screen voting got the ax, as did a
three-day "holiday" from sales taxes this summer, designed to give parents a
break in paying for school supplies.
A program to clean up California's beaches was slashed from $100 million to
$10 million. Another that would encourage the development of parkways along
rivers was cut in half, from $70 million to $35 million.
"Generally, if it was a new program that was not law the year before, it got
pared back significantly and sometimes entirely," Davis said.
The revised proposal also calls for a 2.5 percent across-the-board cut for
state departments, except for those involved in public safety or making money
for the state. That move is expected to save $50 million.
The governor said his revised budget preserves much of the school spending he
proposed in January.
"Notwithstanding the reduction in revenues, I'm not about to let our
commitment to education backslide," he said.
Still, Davis made some adjustments to his education plan. In January, he
proposed expanding the middle school year from 180 days to 210 days. That
proposal has been pared back to 200 days.
Davis also had hoped to increase rewards to schools that do well from $63 per
student to $150, but that increase has been jettisoned.
On the plus side, the new proposal adds $220 million to help schools
performing poorly on standardized testing, and $541 million to help offset
school districts' increased spending on energy and to promote conservation.
School districts taking part in that program must commit to cutting their
energy use 10 percent.
Overall, the amount spent on each student would drop $6 from the $7,174
proposed in January.
Davis, however, touted a 43 percent increase in education spending since he
became governor. He invited several education leaders to the news conference
announcing the revised budget, and his office released a collection of quotes
from the educators praising him for maintaining school funding.
Even Republicans found something to like in the Democratic governor's
education proposals.
"Certainly, if he kept education whole, we agree with that," said Assemblyman
Dave Cox, R-Sacramento, the Assembly minority leader.
But that was about the extent of bipartisan harmony.
"We simply don't think the governor is moving in a prudent direction," Cox
said.
He blasted the proposed budget for reducing the reserve from $1.9 billion to
$1 billion. Republicans have advocated maintaining the reserve and adding a
special energy reserve to avoid the need for borrowing or raising electricity
rates again next year.
Davis said the $1 billion is enough. "Reserves are for rainy days," he said.
"It's starting to rain."
Republicans oppose Davis' plan to allow a quarter-cent sales tax increase
that was eliminated this year to go into effect again next January.
Cox said Republicans also would oppose the delay in shifting gasoline sales
tax to a special fund to relieve traffic congestion. He said Republicans
fought for the change, believing that a gasoline tax should be dedicated to
transportation projects.
Republican opposition to that provision, key to Davis' plan to balance the
budget, could spell trouble for the budget bill. The bill requires a
two-thirds vote and must garner the support of at least a handful of
Republicans.
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San Francisco, said the delay in
shifting gasoline sales tax money means that "program cuts don't go as deep
as they might have."
The revised budget preserves spending for home health care workers and
part-time community college workers, Burton said.
"But we're going to have to find more money for child care," he said.
In addition, Burton said, he hoped that the Legislature could find a way to
give raises to state workers.
He said that barring an economic rebound, next year's budget will be far
tougher because the state will no longer enjoy a big cushion.

PG&E goes to court for rate relief
By Claire Cooper
Bee Legal Affairs Writer
(Published May 15, 2001)
SAN FRANCISCO -- Pacific Gas and Electric Co. warned in bankruptcy court
Monday that it could be forced out of business by a March regulatory ruling
that prolonged a freeze on retail electricity rates.
But U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali said PG&E might still be in
financial trouble, even without the accounting change by the state Public
Utilities Commission in March. Montali expressed reservations about the
utility's request for an injunction to block the change.
The accounting question -- and the timing of the expiration of the rate
freeze -- centers on whether PG&E has made up its transition costs in moving
from a regulated to an unregulated market.
Montali said he'll rule as soon as possible, given the importance and
complexity of the issue.
PG&E projects a loss of $12.9 billion by next March because of an imbalance
between low retail electricity rates and high wholesale rates since June.
Without relief, said PG&E lawyer Jerome Falk, the utility could be forced to
liquidate.
In April, the utility filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code, which requires judicial authorization for most actions that
reduce the value of the debtor's assets. PG&E contends the PUC violated that
requirement by forcing it to operate under the rate freeze.
But the PUC contends that PG&E's real motive is to free itself from state
regulatory control.
"We're talking about disabling the commission" by ending its authority over
rates, PUC lawyer Walter Rieman told Montali.
The commission didn't need court authorization because its action --
technically just an accounting change -- preceded PG&E's bankruptcy filing,
Rieman argued.
Rieman said such a regulatory action needs no authorization and that the 11th
Amendment -- the sovereign immunity clause of the U.S. Constitution -- bars
PG&E from hauling the PUC into court.

Energy Digest: PUC delays vote on rate proposals


(Published May 15, 2001)
People who run shops and farms, refineries and concrete plants have to wait
another day to learn how big a share they'll pay of an already approved
electricity rate hike.
The state Public Utilities Commission delayed until today its vote on at
least two proposals for new rate structures, and a third proposal could
emerge.
PUC President Loretta Lynch said the commission needed more time to work on
last-minute revisions, triggered by input during last week's public hearings.
The delay came after protesters urged the commission Monday to reject any
rate increases, and instead seize power plants from new owners who have
raised wholesale prices under deregulation. Several called for boycotting the
higher electric bills.
The new rates will apply to customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and
Southern California Edison. They will vary widely by customer, but proposals
before the commission call for average residential PG&E rate increases of 15
percent to 17 percent, and industrial increases of about 50 percent.
The rate increases, which will be applied toward paying off enormous
wholesale power bills, will raise about an extra $4.8 billion annually for
the two utilities.
--Carrie Peyton

Edison parent has loss
Its losses still piling up from soaring wholesale power costs, the parent
company of Southern California Edison reported a $617.3 million loss and
scrapped its shareholder dividend payment again Monday.
Edison International said the loss, for the three months that ended March 31,
amounted to $1.89 a share.
The Rosemead-based utility said it was canceling its common stockholder
dividend for the third straight quarter. It also is continuing to defer
payments on preferred shares.

Dan Walters: Davis wants to preserve rosy budget, let red ink rain on
Legislature


(Published May 15, 2001)
Once upon a time, the grammatically incorrect "May revise" was a low-level
exercise in fine-tuning income and outgo numbers prior to passage of a state
budget.
Beginning in the late 1990s, however, the spring ritual became elevated in
importance because an exploding economy was generating billions of
unanticipated tax dollars, thus allowing the governor and legislators to
create lavish new spending programs.
A year ago, Gov. Gray Davis and the state legislators were looking at a $14
billion budget surplus, fueling another round of tax cuts and spending. But
the high-technology balloon has burst, the tech-oriented Nasdaq market has
tanked and Monday's budget revision, released by the Davis administration,
anticipates about a $4.2 billion reduction in revenues from what was
originally projected in January.
If it's a cold dose of reality on the revenue side of the ledger, however,
the expenditure column of the revised budget is swathed in politically
contrived fantasy -- and represents the beginning of a high-stakes chess game
pitting Davis against a Legislature dominated by fellow Democrats.
While the revised Davis budget for fiscal 2001-02 reduces overall general
fund spending from the January version -- with reductions principally in
transportation, housing and proposed tax cuts -- it boosts spending on K-12
schools and community colleges to nearly $5 billion over the minimum
guarantees of the California Constitution.
Davis said his goal was to "curb government spending but ... protect my two
highest priorities: public education and law enforcement." And to reinforce
that stance, the governor's office packed the budget news conference with
representatives of public schools, ranging from the superintendent of the Los
Angeles Unified School District to teachers union lobbyists. They played
their designated role in the mini-drama by publicly lauding the governor's
school money, even if privately many acknowledged that the additional school
financing is far from certain.
The real story of this year's May budget revision is that Davis is trying to
force the Legislature into making the spending cuts that economic reality --
and the state energy crisis -- will probably require so that he can maintain
his image as the champion of education going into his re-election campaign.
The new Davis budget is plainly unworkable. By maintaining education spending
and cutting reserves to the bone, the spending plan makes no allowance for
further drops in revenues, even though harsh experience is that in an
economic slump, income tends to fall much further and faster than Department
of Finance bean-counters project.
Furthermore, the budget assumes that the $7 billion -- and still rising -- in
general fund expenditures for electric power will be completely reimbursed
from a $13.4 billion state bond issue and that no additional money will be
needed during the high energy consumption summer months. But that, too, flies
in the face of reasonable expectations. The governor's energy purchase plans
are based on very optimistic conservation numbers and, most ominously, on a
declining price of electricity while the futures market indicates that prices
may, in fact, jump by 50 percent over the next few months.
It's entirely possible that the entire bond issue will have been consumed by
the time the bonds are sold in August and that the state will still be laying
out billions of dollars each month for juice. State legislative leaders, even
the most liberal ones, want to create a multibillion-dollar budget reserve
for those huge uncertainties, but with Davis taking his damn-the-torpedoes
approach, they would be the ones to cut spending, including for the schools,
to build up reserves. Or they could approve the Davis budget more or less as
proposed and let him take the heat if, and when, the uncertainties become a
multibillion-dollar red ink shower.
While politicians scramble to claim credit when times are good, they scheme
to shift the blame when times turn sour, and Davis' budget is the opening
move of that finger-pointing game.

Daniel Weintraub: Consumer rep envisions ultimate confrontation


(Published May 15, 2001)

Now that Gov. Gray Davis has rallied his fellow Democrats, run over the
Republican opposition in the Legislature and set the state on a course to
borrow $13 billion to pay for a few months of electricity purchases, there's
probably only one person who can stop him: Harvey Rosenfield.
Rosenfield is the Santa Monica-based consumer advocate who tried to halt
California's experiment in electricity deregulation before it got started.
His 1998 ballot measure failed, and that campaign is blamed in some circles
for delaying construction of new power plants just long enough to cause the
electricity shortage that's helped send prices heavenward.
But if Rosenfield's last ballot initiative got the state's energy
establishment in a snit, the one he's contemplating now would positively push
them over the edge. He is seriously considering launching a signature drive
to force a referendum on the legislation Davis just signed to authorize his
$13 billion energy bond measure.
That bond, to be repaid by ratepayers, is supposed to reimburse the state's
general fund for the cost of electricity the state has been buying for
consumers since January, when Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California
Edison ran out of money. The bond measure also will be used to delay the pain
of the extremely high prices expected this summer. Without it, consumers
would immediately face another staggering rate increase, probably well into
triple digits.
The alternative would be a state budget in shambles. All the tax money Davis
has spent on electricity this year already was earmarked for traditional
services such as education, roads and health care. A referendum that killed
the bond measure would leave a gaping hole in the budget that could only be
filled by a huge tax increase or unprecedented spending cuts.
Rosenfield is something of a publicity hound, and his talk of a referendum
may be just that. Collecting 750,000 signatures in less than 90 days, which
is what's required to qualify the referendum, would be a massive undertaking.
Even Rosenfield concedes that the chances are no better than 50-50 that he
will proceed. But this is a man who has qualified two measures for the ballot
already, including one in 1988 that brought on regulation of the California
insurance industry. You have to take him seriously.
The question is why he would even consider it. Why would a man who fancies
himself a friend of the ratepayer ponder a move that would force consumers to
swallow a massive rate hike, or else bankrupt the state? Because Rosenfield's
goal is to see the destruction of the entire private power system that's now
serving California -- and raking in enormous profits for its owners.
And if it were up to him, he'd be willing to risk economic catastrophe to
make it happen. His theory is that the power generators will simply keep
raising their prices as long as the governor keeps putting more money on the
table. It is, he says, like giving crack to an addict. Take that money away,
and the generators will kick the habit, fast.
"If bleeding dry the general fund is foreclosed, and politically or as a
matter of economics you can't raise rates that high in the state, the only
thing the governor can do is turn to the generators and say, 'I'm taking your
plants.' At which point they will say, 'OK, all right, we're lowering our
prices,' or some face-saving thing will happen. The ultimate showdown between
naked capitalism and populist outrage occurs." And he's convinced that
capitalism will blink.
"If the lights go off in California, and the economy goes down the tubes,
then 20 years of Republican ideology, of less government, free markets,
competition -- all of that goes down the tubes.
"All you have to do is look at history to see that when there have been
economic cataclysms that have decimated the economy, people want action and
they'll do anything, whether its seizing private property, or whatever. There
will be a revolution, and I don't think the political institutions in this
country are prepared to push things to that point."
The Legislature already has set a Nov. 15 deadline after which the state
budget is supposed to be off-limits to Davis' power-buying ways. But that's
not good enough for Rosenfield. By then, he thinks, Davis will have burned
through the entire proceeds of the first bond measure and the total tab will
be approaching $20 billion. Rates will have to rise again to pay that bill.
Rosenfield is prescribing an economic amputation -- without anesthesia -- to
stop a painful and dangerous infection. But he is not the only one thinking
about the doomsday scenario.
The power generators themselves have lately been lining up to try to cut
deals with the state. They have offered to take caps on their profits,
forgive some of the debt that's owed them, anything to keep the system
running without further provoking the public's ire. They know that
Rosenfield's kind of anger can be contagious. They want to contain it before
it spreads.

How will state's leaders get out of the business of power-buying?



Inside Politics / ED MENDEL
May 14, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- The California electricity crisis began the big meltdown in
January when the state made the now-questionable decision to begin buying
power for utility customers.
The alternative, which seemed unthinkable to Gov. Gray Davis and most
legislators at the time, was to allow Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern
California Edison to be taken into bankruptcy.
A grim Davis said on the evening of Jan. 17 that he and legislative leaders
had just held a long telephone conversation with the chief executive officers
of four big generators: Duke, Southern (now Mirant), Reliant and Dynegy.
"Those generators were prepared to pull down the utilities into bankruptcy
tomorrow at 12:01 p.m.," Davis told reporters. "They have agreed, if
legislation passes tomorrow, they will not do that. They will provide us the
power necessary to keep the lights on."
Legislation authorizing the state to begin buying power for utility customers
was passed, and the lights stayed on. But the crisis has clearly gotten
worse, not better, since January.
PG&E took itself into bankruptcy early last month. Rolling blackouts, which
have hit many parts of the state, now are a day-to-day possibility.
And today, the state Public Utilities Commission is expected to decide who
will be hit hardest by a record rate increase, while the governor proposes a
revised state budget with a gaping hole.
The state general fund that is paying for power, more than $6 billion so far,
may not be repaid until late August, when a $13.4billion bond that
ratepayers will pay off over 15 years is issued -- well after the new fiscal
year begins on July 1.
One of the main problems facing the governor and the Legislature now is
simply this: Having gotten themselves into the power-buying business, how do
they get out?
The governor's plan to get the utilities back on their financial feet and
able to buy power by the end of next year must overcome obstacles, which seem
bigger with each passing week.
A key part of the plan, the state purchase of the Edison transmission system,
is basically a transaction intended to make state aid for the utility look
less like a bailout. The state would get something in return.
But Democratic legislators, who urged Davis to make the purchase, do not like
the agreement that the governor negotiated with Edison. Democrats in both
houses are talking about alternatives that would be less favorable to Edison.
If Davis is somehow able to work out a compromise acceptable to both
Democratic legislators and Edison, another obstacle remains: Persuading PG&E
creditors that they would be better off under an Edison-like deal than in
bankruptcy court.
As the state faces soaring power costs this summer, and solving complex
problems in the political arena looks increasingly futile, some argue that
the chance to let the utilities go bankrupt in January was a missed
opportunity.
"The credit of the utilities could have been restored by reorganizing under
the bankruptcy laws, the lights would have stayed on, and ratepayers would
actually have ended up paying less than they're going to end up paying with
all the interest-heavy borrowing you're doing now," Sen. Tom McClintock,
R-Northridge, said during a debate on the ratepayer bond last week.
But the fateful decision in January changed everything. If Edison joins PG&E
in bankruptcy now, the state may have to continue buying power for years as a
way is worked out to pay off the utility debt.

PUC delays decision on electricity rate hikes; SDG&E isn't affected



By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 15, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO -- California ratepayers from Orange County to the Oregon
border will have to wait at least one more day to find out how deep they'll
be expected to dig into their pockets to pay electric bills.
Businesses are hoping that state power regulators use that time to revise
proposed new rates they contend are too hard on commercial customers.
Stung by an outcry from every type of energy consumer in California in the
last few days, the state's top energy regulator said yesterday she needs more
time to consider feedback from residents and businesses -- each demanding
that the largest rate hikes in state history take a bigger bite from the
other's account.

In her initial proposal, Loretta Lynch, president of the Public Utilities
Commission, would have spared many residential users from the highest bills
and placed more of the burden on businesses and farms.
That feedback also includes Gov. Gray Davis' statement Sunday that he prefers
his own plan, which would distribute rate hikes more evenly among residential
and business customers.
Consumer activists worry that the PUC's one-day delay could mean bigger rate
hikes for residential customers. The PUC is scheduled to vote this afternoon.
San Diego Gas and Electric Co. customers would not be affected.
SDG&E has requested a rate hike, but the PUC has not considered it yet.
"Much as we hope the commission heard what the public had to say last week,
we know the voices of business and industrial customers are very, very loud,"
said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for The Utility Reform Network.
Business groups hope the hunch is right.
"We can only hope that this extra time means that they're carefully
evaluating a plan that will perhaps be more balanced and more proportional
than what they've put forward so far," said Michelle Montague-Bruno,
spokeswoman for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group that represents 190
businesses.
PUC Commissioner Jeff Brown said after yesterday's meeting that he and other
commissioners are trying to lower proposed industrial rates, but said that's
tricky business.
Commissioner Carl Wood said that today is the latest date the PUC can make
its decision and still give Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern
California Edison Co., the state's two largest utilities, enough time to add
the new rates to electric bills by June 1.
Energy experts fear that's already too late for the price shock to spur vital
conservation this summer and help stave off more rolling blackouts.
Lynch's initial proposal would raise rates anywhere from 7 percent to 61
percent.
Since it unanimously approved an increase March 27, the commission has
struggled to fashion specific rate hikes that will simultaneously recoup the
billions the state has spent buying power, return the state's largest
utilities to solvency and trigger conservation.
The allocation the PUC approves will be retroactive to March 27. Charges for
interim power use will be spread over the next 12 months, Lynch has said.
Lynch and PUC Administrative Law Judge Christine Walwyn introduced proposals
last week that business interests said would unfairly make them pay too much
of the overall rate hike -- as much as 50 percent more than they pay now
depending what time of day they use the electricity.
State law shields average residential customers from severe rate hikes on
much of their power use.







Edison, SoCal Edison extend credit facilities



REUTERS
May 15, 2001
NEW YORK, ) Edison International said Tuesday that it and its troubled
Southern California Edison utility unit extended two 364-day bank credit
facilities that were scheduled to mature Monday.
Rosemead, Calif.-based Edison said it extended a $618 million facility, which
it had fully drawn down, until June 30, while SoCal Edison extended a $200
million facility until Sept. 15.
Edison said it and SoCal Edison also agreed with their banks, which are led
by J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., to extend "forbearance agreements," under which
the banks agree not to act upon defaults, to June 30 for Edison and to Sept.
15 for its utility unit.
Edison made the disclosures Tuesday in a quarterly filing with the Securities
and Exchange Commission. On Monday it reported a first-quarter loss of $617
million, or $1.89 per share, including a $661 million charge for power costs.
SoCal Edison, California's second-largest utility, and Pacific Gas & Electric
Co., the largest, have struggled because a rate freeze blocked them from
passing on their massive wholesale power costs to consumers. Pacific G&E, a
unit of San Francisco-based PG&E Corp., sought bankruptcy protection last
month.







PG&E, state regulators spar in bankruptcy court



By Michael Liedtke
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 15, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) Contending California regulators illegally seek billions of
dollars that should be paid to its creditors, Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
urged a federal bankruptcy judge to dismantle the accounting framework
insulating the utility's customers from additional electricity price
increases.
Looking to guard its turf, the California Public Utilities Commission
portrayed its actions as legal maneuvers protected from federal government
interference under the U.S. Constitution.
The 2-hour bout of arguments Monday before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis
Montali represented the first major legal showdown in PG&E's bankruptcy case
) the largest ever filed by a utility. After peppering attorneys from both
sides with tough questions, Montali took the matter under submission without
providing a timetable for issuing a decision.
The complex issue centers on arcane sections of the U.S. bankruptcy code that
could sway the balance of power in PG&E's case and determine whether the
utility's 4.6 million customers ) or more than 150,000 creditors ) absorb the
costs underlying an estimated $13 billion in wholesale electricity purchases
made from June 2000 through March 2002.
As part of the 1998 deregulation of California's electricity market, PG&E's
retail rates were to remain frozen through March 2002 or whenever the utility
pooled enough money from above-market rates and asset sales to pay for
unprofitable investments made during its long history as a regulated utility.
PG&E says it cleared the hurdle for lifting the rate freeze sometime between
May 2000 and August 2000 ) around the same time the utility's costs for
wholesale electricity began to soar far above the frozen rate charged to its
customers. Between January 1998 and May 2000, PG&E accumulated a $2.75
billion operating profit from a favorable gap between its wholesale costs and
retail rates for electricity.
The utility said it could have proved its case for lifting the rate freeze
and passing on its electricity costs if the PUC hadn't adopted new accounting
guidelines March 27 ) 10 days before PG&E filed for bankruptcy. Besides
changing the accounting rules governing the rate freeze, the PUC's March 27
order also authorized average price increases of up to 40 percent for
households and up to 52 percent for businesses.
PG&E says those increases ) expected to begin showing up in June electricity
bills ) still aren't enough to recoup its costs.
The accounting rules imposed by the PUC will make it virtually impossible for
PG&E to lift the rate freeze before the end of March 2002, PG&E attorney
Jerome B. Falk Jr. told Montali on Monday.
The rate freeze dumped the utility into an $8.9 billion hole between June
2000 and February of this year and could siphon another $4 billion from PG&E
by the end of March 2002, Falk said. PG&E contends federal law prevents third
parties from taking money from companies protected under bankruptcy.
If Montali kills the new accounting rules, Falk said, "it would be our
expectation that (the PUC) would do the right thing under California law" and
allow the utility to raise its rates even more.
The PUC contends Montali is prevented from ruling on the matter under an 11th
Amendment guarantee of "sovereign immunity" to state government agencies as
long as they are obeying the law.
"It's not an appropriate matter to litigate here," PUC attorney Walter Rieman
told Montali. "Regulation is shielded (under the Constitution), whether it's
smart or not smart."






California power regulators delay decision on rate hikes



By Karen Gaudette
ASSOCIATED PRESS
May 15, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) California ratepayers still don't know how much more they'll
owe on next month's electric bills, and consumer activists fear the delay
could mean even higher rates for residential customers.
Loretta Lynch, President of the Public Utilities Commission, postponed a vote
on proposed new rates until Tuesday afternoon, saying she needed more time to
review feedback from every type of energy consumer in California.
"What we're doing is fine-tuning and tweaking the proposal," Lynch said after
Monday's meeting. "Everybody in California is going to pay more."
In her initial proposal, Lynch would have spared many residential users from
the highest bills and placed more of the burden on businesses and farms.
But an outcry from businesses proclaiming that the rate hikes will doom
California's economy ) followed by a Sunday statement from Gov. Gray Davis
chiding the PUC for not allocating rates evenly over all ratepayers ) has
consumer groups wondering if Davis has urged the PUC to shifting more of the
rate hikes onto residential customers.
"The big industrial customers have been on a lobbying rampage the past
several days trying to get more of the increase placed on residential
customers," said Mike Florio, senior attorney with The Utility Reform
Network.
Steve Maviglio, a Davis spokesman, maintained that the PUC is an independent
body. Three of the five commissioners, however, are Davis appointees.
Commissioner Jeff Brown said Monday he was looking into lessening the impact
on businesses.
Business groups definitely hope the extra day translates into a lighter
touch.
"We can only hope that this extra time means that they're carefully
evaluating a plan that will perhaps be more balanced and more proportional
than what they've put forward so far," said Michelle Montague-Bruno,
spokeswoman for the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group that represents 190
busineses.
Commissioner Carl Wood said Tuesday is the latest date the PUC can make its
decision and still give Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California
Edison Co., the state's two largest utilities, enough time to add the new
rates to electric bills by June 1.
Energy experts fear that's already too late for the price shock to spur vital
conservation this summer and help stave off some of the 30 days of rolling
blackouts predicted by managers of the state power grid.
Lynch's initial proposal raises rates anywhere from 7 percent to 61 percent )
depending on everything from whether the customer manufactures sweatshirts,
heats a swimming pool or processes tomatoes. Nearly everyone would feel some
pain.
Since it unanimously approved rate hikes March 27, the commission has
struggled to fashion rates that will simultaneously recoup the $5.2 billion
the state has spent buying power, return the state's largest utilities to
solvency and trigger enough conservation to help fend off some of this
summer's rolling blackouts.
The allocation the PUC approves will be retroactive to March 27. Charges for
interim power use will be spread over the next 12 months, Lynch has said.
Lynch and PUC Administrative Law Judge Christine Walwyn introduced proposals
last week that business interests said would unfairly make them pay too much
of the overall rate hike ) as much as 50 percent more than they pay now
depending what time of day they use the electricity.
Under Lynch's plan, as many as half of PG&E and SoCal Edison's 9 million
customers would not see their bills rise at all. She would bill residential
customers at several different levels based on how much power they use.
San Diego Gas and Electric Co. customers would not be affected. Neither would
ratepayers who buy their electricity directly from energy wholesalers rather
than through utilities, such as the state's public university systems.
While state law shields average residential customers from severe rate hikes
on much of their power use, businesses would have to pay more for every
kilowatt so the state can raise around $5 billion.
That worries small businesses like Spretto, an Oakland restaurant that no
longer serves lunch and laid off five workers because of its growing electric
bill.
"It's horrendous," said Pamela Drake, a spokeswoman with the Oakland Alliance
for Community Energy. "Small businesses operate within a smaller margin, even
successful ones, and can't afford to pay anymore."
Consumer activists sporting white jumpsuits emblazoned with the word
"Ratebusters" and other members of the public told the PUC to stop taking
public comment if it didn't plan to listen and protect residents from rate
hikes.
"I was raised to pay my bills and be responsible," said April Lankford of San
Francisco. "But I have a right to my own health and safety. That's about hot
water. That's about turning on the heat when it gets cold. I am not going to
not pay my health insurance just to afford electricity."






California faces 260 hours of blackouts, says industry



REUTERS
May 15, 2001
WASHINGTON ) California will have an estimated 260 hours of rotating
electricity blackouts this summer, more than the state or regional
authorities have predicted, the North American Electric Reliability Council
(NERC) said on Tuesday.
Texas, New England, and New York City also face the threat of summer power
outages, NERC officials said at a news conference to unveil their summer
outlook. The Pacific Northwest, which produces huge amounts of hydropower,
can meet its own demand this summer but will have no extra power to sell to
California because of drought conditions, NERC said.
"The assessment concludes that California will experience difficulties
meeting its projected electricity demand this summer and California
electricity users will experience rotating blackouts, much more so than last
summer or this winter," said Michehl Gent, president of NERC.
California's "deficiencies will be more severe" than estimates by the
California Independent System Operator, NERC officials said. NERC said
curtailments of power in the state could total as much as 260 hours over the
course of the summer, with an average curtailment of about 2,150 megawatts.
Previous estimates from the state and region estimated about 200 hours of
rotating blackouts this summer.
NERC is a non-profit entity formed after the 1965 blackouts in the
northeastern United States and promotes reliability of the nation's bulk
electricity systems.






AES to restart 2 retired South California power plants



REUTERS
May 14, 2001
ARLINGTON, VA ) United States power giant AES Corp. Monday said it will
refurbish two retired gas-fired power plants in Southern California,
generating an additional 450 megawatts of power for electricity-strapped
state.
Arlington, Virginia-based AES said the California Energy Commission certified
the company's refurbishing of units 3 and 4 at its Huntington Beach,
California facility about 30 miles(48 km) south of Los Angeles. Both units
were retired in 1995 before AES bought them.
The company said the project will bring the two power plants up-to-date,
replacing old boilers and installing state-of-the-art emissions controls.
"Not only will these units be on line in time to address California's urgent
need for electricity this summer, but the modifications will make this plant
one of the cleanest gas-fired plants in California," said Ed Blackford,
President of AES Huntington Beach.






PUC Delays Decision on Power Rate Hike
Energy: Panel will discuss a new plan today that would shift more of the
burden to residences from business.

By TIM REITERMAN and MARLA DICKERSON, Times Staff Writers

SAN FRANCISCO--The state's utility regulators delayed a decision Monday
on how to structure a $5-billion electricity rate increase until today, when
they will take up a revised plan that is expected to shift a larger share
onto residential customers.
Assailed by power users and pressured by the governor, the California
Public Utilities Commission said more time was needed to assess the impact on
competing interest groups.
"The problem here is making sure we are allocating [the increase]
equitably," PUC President Loretta Lynch said after the meeting. That, she
said, is "tricky."
About half the residential customers of the state's two largest
utilities would see increases under Lynch's plan proposed last week. Bills
for Southern California Edison customers who use moderate to heavy amounts of
power would rise about 9% to 60%. Similar customers of Pacific Gas & Electric
Co. would experience increases of about 7% to 40%.
To encourage conservation, Lynch said, she favors moving more of the
overall burden of the increases to residential customers who are moderate
users of electricity. Other commissioners say they believe that such a shift
is necessary to protect the state's business climate.
Consumer advocates voiced concern that the PUC may be yielding to
pressure from industry groups that enjoy relatively low rates but say they
are being hit unfairly with much larger percentage increases than residential
customers.
"The fear is the commission is caving in and taking [the increase] off
big [business] customers and putting it on residential users above 130% of
baseline," said Mike Florio, senior attorney for the Utility Reform Network.
The baseline amount on a bill is the minimum of electricity deemed
necessary for a customer and varies by region. Under state legislation, there
is no rate increase for consumption up to 130% of baseline. Also exempted are
low-income customers who already receive discounted electricity rates.
The commission passed an increase of 3 cents a kilowatt hour March 27.
In recent weeks, the panel has been conducting hearings on how to divvy up
the increase among 9 million customers of Edison and PG&E. Monday's meeting
was supposed to climax that process, paving the way for utilities to start
billing customers June 1.
Dozens of speakers addressed the commission, and boisterous protesters
in white coveralls repeatedly criticized the rate increase, chanting: "I
ain't payin' no hike, while they're getting rich from our power rates! Who
you gonna call? Rate Busters!" One had to be dragged away from the microphone.
To stunned surprise, Lynch later announced that the commission would not
vote on her rate design proposed last week or a similar one proposed by a PUC
administrative law judge.
Lynch revised the plan over the weekend and some commissioners said they
had not yet seen the changes.
The delay means two commissioners will be out of town when the
five-member panel designs the state's largest rate increase ever.
Commissioner Richard Bilas is undergoing a medical procedure in Mendocino
County. Commissioner Henry Duque is traveling to Texas as a director of the
National Assn. of Utilities Commissioners. They said the law permits them to
vote by phone as long as they do it from a publicly accessible place.
Lynch's proposal called for average rate increases of about 20% to 50%
for various classes of customers. But officials said the proposal was being
reviewed after testimony late last week and mounting concerns among some
commissioners that it would hit industry and big commercial customers too
hard, potentially hurting the state's economy.
After his financial advisors reviewed the PUC's proposals, Gov. Gray
Davis put out a statement over the weekend saying his own proposal, including
a slightly smaller rate hike, was better.
"My plan raises sufficient revenues to deal with the problem without
putting an undue burden on California consumers and businesses that might
hurt our economy," he said.
The governor's office last week asked the PUC to "come around," said
press secretary Steve Maviglio. "There are gaps between his proposal and the
PUC's."
Carl Wood, one of three Davis appointees on the commission, said that he
was generally comfortable with the Lynch proposal but that "this is a big
decision, and it is not ready" for a vote.
Jeff Brown, another Davis appointee, said he spoke to the governor's
office recently and learned that Davis had two primary concerns about the
proposal: "No. 1 that there be sufficient price signals within the
residential class [to make people conserve], and that the industrials not be
walloped and have some mitigation of the rate increase."
Brown said he would like to see industrial users paying less than the
50% hike in Lynch's proposal. He said that would mean residents who consume
300% of their baseline amount would have their rates rise 28% instead of
about 15%.
"I want [the proposed amount for industrial customers] to go down
somewhat but can't put all the burden on residentials," he said. "There are
no good answers."
Duque and Bilas, appointees of former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson,
expressed concerns that the rate proposal would further damage the economy.
"Industry is not getting a fair shake," Bilas said. "If you want to
achieve maximum conservation, you put [the increase] where demand is most
elastic. It should be placed on you and me."
Duque said: "I think [industrial users] are getting an undue amount."
Business groups have argued strongly that consumers must endure their
fair share of the pain in order to encourage conservation.
Carl Guardino, president and chief executive of the Silicon Valley
Manufacturing Group, said his group phoned Davis' staff to voice their
opposition to the proposed rate structure.
"We found a receptive audience," he said. "They saw that this [proposed
rate structure] will deeply hinder our economy."

El Paso Gas Supplier Denies Monopoly
Energy: In trial-like hearing, federal panel is told company had control over
Southern California market.

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON--A Texas energy conglomerate accused of driving up natural
gas prices in California might have amassed monopolistic power at times last
year, according to opening testimony Monday before the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.
FERC economist Jonathan Ogur said that under certain conditions during
the past year, a subsidiary of El Paso Corp. of Houston might have controlled
as much as 45% of the pipeline capacity for shipping gas to Southern
California. That share exceeds a commonly used threshold of 35%, raising
concern with regulators.
"We obviously disagree with that," said Bill Sherman, lead lawyer for El
Paso Merchant Energy, which markets natural gas. Merchant is accused by the
California Public Utilities Commission and Southern California Edison of
withholding supply in a bid to raise prices. It had contracted with its
pipeline affiliate--El Paso Natural Gas Co.--for rights to ship 1.2 billion
cubic feet of natural gas a day to California.
The El Paso firms say the allegations are based on a misrepresentation
of how their relationship worked. They argue that natural gas prices in
California have spiked much higher than elsewhere in the country because of
insatiable demand from power plants, a lack of pipeline capacity within the
state, and shortages brought on by unusual weather. High prices for natural
gas are a key component of California's soaring energy bills.
"We did nothing wrong," said Norma Dunn, a vice president with El Paso
Corp. "We need to look at this in context. All shippers were trying to move
as much gas as they could into the state. The problem is you can't get all
that much gas into the state."
The issue of market share appeared to loom large in the administrative
hearing, which has become the closest thing to a trial arising from
California's energy crisis. A company that controls a large portion of any
market enhances its ability to dictate prices and other conditions.
El Paso Merchant has argued that its market share should be computed as
a proportion of the statewide natural gas market, in which case it would fall
below 20% and would not raise anti-competitive concerns.
But the PUC counters that, because of difficulties in shipping gas from
north to south within the state, El Paso's true market is limited to Southern
California.
"The question of the geographic market makes a tremendous difference in
how El Paso Merchant's market share will be measured and the results,"
acknowledged Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. in an opening statement. "If the
market is Southern California and not the entire state, the figures tend to
demonstrate a rather high level of concentration in El Paso Merchant."
Ogur said in prepared testimony filed last week that it is "likely" that
El Paso exercised market power in Southern California.
Wagner will hear the evidence and present a decision to the FERC board,
which has the authority to order El Paso to surrender any ill-gotten profits.
During cross-examination Monday, Sherman sought to discredit the
testimony of Sandra Rovetti, a technical analyst with the PUC. Rovetti had
submitted testimony in which she said she studied the market in a "controlled
experiment" and concluded that El Paso Merchant had wielded monopolistic
power to drive up prices.
But Sherman won an admission from Rovetti that she had not considered
the price impact of such factors as unusual weather and power plant outages.
The hearing is expected to last all week and a decision from Wagner is
due before June 30.

Labor Courted on Bush Reform Plan
Politics: The meeting with union leaders prefaces today's counterproposal by
Democrats.

By RICHARD SIMON and EDWIN CHEN, Times Staff Writers

WASHINGTON--The Bush administration aimed its energy policy campaign at
an unusual constituency Monday, telling union leaders that building more
power plants and increasing oil and gas drilling will mean more jobs for
their members.
Vice President Dick Cheney and Labor Secretary Elaine Chao courted
leaders of about a dozen unions during a private White House session that
appeared designed to drive a wedge into the labor-environmental coalition
that has blocked previous pro-business initiatives.
"I don't think we're being used," Teamsters President James P. Hoffa
told reporters after the meeting. "Don't forget. American workers will be
solving this problem. They will be building the resources to refine and
generate new energy."
It was the latest round in an escalating public relations battle over
the comprehensive national energy policy drafted by a task force headed by
Cheney. The plan will be unveiled Thursday by President Bush.
Today, House Democrats plan to gather at a Washington gas station to
announce their own formula for reducing the nation's energy problems. It will
call for immediate steps to address high energy prices and supply shortages,
such as asking federal regulators to investigate allegations of price gouging.
A group of 67 Democratic lawmakers sent Bush a letter Monday urging him
to pressure the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase
world crude oil production.
"Notwithstanding our confidence in your Cabinet's extensive knowledge of
and experience with the petroleum industry, we remain concerned that your
administration has done little at this late date to address the coming crisis
in gasoline prices," the letter says.
Cheney reiterated his belief that there are no short-term fixes for the
combination of factors contributing to higher gasoline prices nationwide and
continuing shortages of electricity in California.
The vice president criticized Gov. Gray Davis for suggesting that the
administration's opposition to electricity price controls is tied to its
political support from Texas-based energy producers who are profiting off
California's troubles.
In the Associated Press interview, Cheney characterized appeals for
price controls and a federal investigation of gasoline prices as "exactly the
kind of misguided--I'm trying to think how to state this
gracefully--politically motivated policies we've had in the past."
Cheney said Bush might back a reduction of the 18.4-cent-per-gallon
federal gasoline tax, AP reported. Opponents say such a move could threaten
highway projects funded by the tax.
The administration's comprehensive energy plan is expected to call for
opening more federal land to oil and gas exploration, promoting increased use
of nuclear power and streamlining the approval process for power plants, gas
pipelines and oil refineries.
In addition, the plan is expected to propose a massive upgrade of the
nation's electricity transmission system, including granting federal
authorities eminent domain authority to acquire private property for power
transmission lines.
Environmentalists and their Democratic allies contend the plan leans too
far toward the supply side. But the administration has said it will include
proposals to promote conservation, energy efficiency and use of renewable
energy sources.
White House officials disputed the notion that the meeting with union
leaders was designed to divide the labor-environmental coalition.
Cheney was scheduled to meet today with advocates of renewable energy
sources, such as wind and solar power.
Hoffa said his group was not provided with enough details of the
administration's energy plan to offer an immediate endorsement.
Mike Mathis, government affairs director of the Teamsters, said, "We're
going to be supportive of a program that creates jobs."

Judge Asked to Block Freeze on Power Rate


By MAURA DOLAN, Times Legal Affairs Writer

SAN FRANCISCO--Lawyers for Pacific Gas & Electric clashed with attorneys
for the state in federal bankruptcy court here Monday over whether the court
should block a state regulatory order that prolongs an electricity rate
freeze.
After three hours of arguments, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali
said he will prepare a written decision. "It will be issued when I am ready
to issue it," Montali told a packed courtroom.
The legal battle represents PG&E's first attempt to use its bankruptcy
petition to protect itself from state regulators--the California Public
Utilities Commission.
PG&E has asked Montali to block a key accounting order the commissioners
approved March 27, several days before the Northern California utility filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
The utility contends that the order illegally extended a freeze on
electricity rates. Lawyers for the state counter that the PUC has sovereign
immunity under the 11th Amendment, and the judge has no power to intrude on
its regulatory decision making.
Montali asked a PG&E lawyer how he could get around the protection
argument.
"Because we have commissioners who are shielded by sovereign immunity,
don't I have to find a potential ongoing violation of federal law [to
intervene]?" the judge asked.
Jerome Falk, the lawyer for PG&E, said the regulatory commission was
breaking federal law by blocking the utility's ability to use the Bankruptcy
Act's protections to reorganize.
Under PG&E's calculation, the rate freeze imposed by deregulation should
have ended in mid-2000. The utility stands to lose $4 billion because of the
continuation of the freeze, Falk told Montali.
"Don't let it get $4 billion worse," he pleaded.
Walter Rieman, representing the state, countered that the commissioners
were acting in their regulatory capacity when they approved the accounting
change.
"Here we have rate-making and regulation in its classic and purest
form," Rieman told the judge.
Because of the rate freeze, the utility must buy power at a cost higher
than the rates it charges, Falk said.
"Money is going out. . .," Falk said. "Assets of the estate are
threatened with diminution, major diminution, as a result of this order."
Montali asked him what would happen if he blocked the regulatory order.
Would the rate freeze immediately end?
Falk replied that PG&E would return to the PUC and make its case for an
end to the freeze. "I am not asking you to set rates."
Lawyers for the state pointed out that PG&E happily accepted the rate
freeze when it allowed the utility to sell power at higher than market rates.
In their view, PG&E wants a ruling against the rate order to give the utility
more leverage against the state in the future.
Montali questioned Rieman about what authority, if any, the Bankruptcy
Court has over the utilities commission.
"You want me to say that everything the commission has done or will do
is insulated," Montali said. "I don't know how I can do that, and maybe I
can't."
The judge asked Rieman whether the PUC could eventually approve
retroactive rate increases. Rieman said it was "possible" but he was not sure
retroactive hikes would be "appropriate."
PG&E filed for bankruptcy protection after accumulating more than $9
billion in debts since state-ordered deregulation in 1996. The case is the
third largest bankruptcy in U.S. history.

Edison Deal Sets High Legislative Hurdle for Davis
Capitol: Rescue bill faces opposition from lawmakers and competition from
plans that include buying utility.

By DAN MORAIN and NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writers

SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis faces the toughest legislative challenge of
his tenure as he tries to win votes for a deal he says is needed to keep
Southern California Edison out of bankruptcy--even as lawmakers work on
alternative plans.
Davis has tapped Sen. Richard Polanco to carry the bill, and the Los
Angeles Democrat is expected to introduce legislation implementing key parts
of the Edison deal this week. But even before hearings begin, key lawmakers
say the Davis plan has little chance of success, at least not in its current
form.
Some Democrats in the Assembly are considering the possibility that the
effort to rescue Edison could falter, that the company could end up in
bankruptcy, and that the state might buy the utility, according to a summary
of various plans prepared by Assembly Democrats.
The document, prepared for Assembly leaders, shows that at least some
members of the lower house are thinking about making a run at buying Edison's
Northern California counterpart, Pacific Gas & Electric, which filed for
bankruptcy last month.
"The state would assume existing secured debt . . . and would pay the
unsecured debt using a combination of the cash that has been hoarded by the
utility . . . and new cash from revenue bonds issued by the California Power
Authority," the document obtained by The Times says.
With Edison's stock price depressed, the cost to the state would be
perhaps $1 billion to $2 billion. PG&E's cost might be less, the document
suggests. The state would have to spend additional sums to pay off the
utilities' creditors.
"I don't know if we have even contemplated that thought," Davis
spokesman Steve Maviglio said of a potential bankruptcy. "We're still
optimistic that the Legislature will agree to the [deal] or a framework that
encompasses most of it."
Lawmakers, meanwhile, shut down their special session on energy Monday,
a necessary step so the state could sell as much as $13.4 billion in bonds by
August to pay for power purchases. Davis quickly reconvened a second special
session to deal with many other energy bills.

Measure Would Use Part of Utility Bills
"This is not going to be solved by the state buying the utilities," said
Bob Foster, the Edison executive who oversees lobbying operation. "It is time
to get real here. The state has a crisis on its hands. It needs to start
digging out."
The 98-page bill would authorize the state to pay $2.76 billion to buy
Edison's high voltage transmission lines, and permit the state to sell bonds
to finance the purchase. Edison would use the money to restructure and pay
down its debt, pegged at $3.5 billion.
Additionally, the bill would earmark part of ratepayers' monthly utility
bills to be used by Edison to pay off debt it incurred in 2000 and early this
year as state regulators barred the company from charging consumers for the
full cost of record wholesale electricity prices.
"The state of California needs to get out of the business of buying
electricity," Polanco said, adding that the measure assumes Edison would take
over the chore of buying power at the end of 2002 once it gains financial
stability. "My reasons for stepping up to the plate is to deal with it and
get it behind us."
Passage of the bill requires simple majorities in the 40-seat Senate and
80-seat Assembly. But Davis is having a hard time persuading fellow Democrats
to embrace the proposal, and Republicans shudder at the prospect of the state
getting more deeply involved in the power business by taking over Edison's
transmission system. Some think Edison should follow PG&E into Bankruptcy
Court.

Some Officials Prefer Bankruptcy Option
"Why should we spend $3.5 billion for something the Bankruptcy Court
does for free?" Sen. Tom McClintock (R-Thousand Oaks) asked. "I don't hear
anybody voicing support for the bailout."
Added Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier): "I haven't been given any
argument why bankruptcy is bad."
Escutia said one of Davis' top aides jokingly threatened to lock Escutia
in a padded room until she voted for the bill. "I told her the governor would
have to put me in a straitjacket, and I still wouldn't vote for it."
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, the Legislature's most influential
Democrat, said he would prefer that Edison not file for bankruptcy, but that
the bankruptcy of Edison's Northern California counterpart, PG&E, has had
little day-to-day impact.
"Bankruptcy is not something I'm afraid of," Burton said.
Burton's biggest criticism of the Davis-Edison accord is that it would
allow independent power sellers, most of which are out-of-state firms, to
recoup all money owed them by Edison.
Burton said no deal will win passage unless the independent generators,
who have reaped significant profits selling wholesale electricity to the
utilities, agree to take a discount on the money they are owed. He called on
them to accept a 30% discount, an amount that Davis embraced last week after
meeting with Burton and other legislators.
Burton's idea is one of at least four alternatives to the Davis-Edison
deal now in the works at the Capitol.
In the lower house, the plan with the most support is being pushed by
Assemblymen John Dutra (D-Fremont) and Joe Nation (D-San Rafael). It would
require that generators and other creditors take 25% less than they are owed,
pushing Edison debt to $2.65 billion, from the current $3.5 billion.
"I have every confidence that generators and marketers will be willing
to bargain," Nation said. His plan also would require an audit by the
California Public Utilities Commission to determine Edison's actual debt,
something not required by Davis' plan. Additionally, the state would have an
option to buy Edison's transmission system, rather than a commitment to
buying it, with the price to be reviewed by the PUC if the transaction is
completed.
Davis has met privately with legislators to ask for support. Davis even
called on executives of independent power companies to lobby lawmakers,
telling them that approval of the measure is the quickest way to ensure that
they will be paid the more than $1 billion that Edison owes them.

To add an element of fun to tonight's hockey,  whomever is going against Brad should "team up" and make a concerted effort to  NOT allow him to carry the puck over the blue line. If two or three guys "rush"  him, he will be forced to "dish the puck" off to a teammate, which he HATES to  do on a rush. He is not happy unless he either shoots or makes a sleek,  goal-mouth pass. His natural arrogance will force him to try to beat all those  who challenge him. If you check him or he makes a bad pass, he gets furious and  is LOTS of fun to watch.
I, for one, am changing teams tonight just to do  this . If I succeed only once, it will have been well worth it!

Hi all

I heard through the grapevine that some of you were curious to know how Milo
was doing. Below is a picture of him with his face painted after a stint at a
Japanese festival. He usually is always smiling but we figured that his
expression was appropriate for the picture.

I apologise for not keeping in touch with you on a more regular basis.

I hope all is good. Here in London things are looking up -- the sun has dared
to come out for full-days at least 6 times since the beginning of the year.

Overall things are good, Milo is great,Kate is warming up to Europe, and work
is busy and interesting.

Take care

I took several assignments from the last World Hunger call.  Status as
follows:
a.   Tax language-  I have sent a prior version of Rev 4 jr to Matt G asking
him to call me to let me know when he can talk with GE tax rep.  Steve Swifit
and I are in London and would like to sit in on that call.
b.   Insurance Language review.   I sent same version to David Marshall and
Paul Parrish asking for their reviews and opinion as to whether 7FA's are new
technology.
c.   I "volunteered" to look at the termination language in world hunger, GE
had some problems, and I had the same problem with the ARCOs contract.   I
drafted a fix last Friday, sent to Kay M for comment.  I have included my
suggested changes in the attached redline.  I have forwarded same fix to GE
at end Friday for Arcos.    I have asked Kay if she still has a concern with
the Limit of Liability as it relates to termination.  I think it works.
d.  I "volunteered" to work over Article 10, Exhibit B-3 and Exhibit B-6 in
relation to Guarantees and liquidated damages.  I have done that in the
attached redline of the T&C and Exhibits.
e. Some time ago I volunteered to resurrect the language associated with the
reduction in the LD refund in Section 10.9.8.   I had sent out a couple weeks
ago but received no reaction.    I have entered that fix in the attached
redline.
f.  I have made several minor changes to definitions associated with
performance.
Attached is Rev4-JR version of GE T&C's and Exhibits for world hunger.  They
start from the clean rev 4 version of the T&Cs that Peter forwarded to me at
my request.  The attached are redlined to show my changes.
I have not sent any of this to GE except for the termination language fix.
I suggest that the Enron team give these a quick read before the World hunger
call.  I can print same here and share with GE during the call unless there
is an objection.
I hope this will help to advance the process.  My earlier emails to Paul and
Matt were not intended confuse the situation with different drafts.  Please
ignore those and for the above purposes use the attached files.
Kay- I suggest that you forward to others who you feel appropriate for the
purposes of the world hunger call on Wednesday.

to insure a smooth transition.
The management committee meetings are held whenever necessary approximately
once per month during construction, but should be less frequent now that the
plant is to be operational May 23.  Jim has mentioned there will be some
issues that need to be cleaned up such as the plant's construction delay (was
guaranteed to be complete 5/1) at the next meeting that should take place in
June.  Also, I think adding capacity to the demineralization plant is a
"no-brainer" to enable us to run the plant at full on the weekends.
Kevin/Dave if you would like to call Andy Ramirez his number is (512)

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


To whom it may concern:

My name is Craig Carmichael.  I am a PhD student at Iowa State
University, working under Dr. Bartlett in the Adaptive Computing Lab.
Please lend me your attention for a brief moment.  Enron's team of power
traders is the first contact I have made in this nature.

I strongly believe that I have developed technology that can make Enron
millions in the very near-term future.  If you are a power trader whose
success is proportional to the accuracy of your load forecasts, then I
believe I can deliver an enormous opportunity to Enron and you.  If I am
way off base on my assessment, please let me know and I will go
somewhere else.  I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO DISCREDIT MY BELIEFS.

Here are some of my credentials, so that you can verify that it might be
promising to read the remainder of this email.

1.  Finishing up ISU PhD work this summer.
2.  Invented multiple neural network methods and inductive learning
techniques.
2.  Recently DEVELOPED THE MOST ACCURATE electric load models in the
Chicago area for ComEd.
3.  Saved ComEd millions of $ over the last couple years because of
this.
4.  Can verify the above claims and that I did this single-handedly.
5.  Wrote the new inductive learning algorithm for New Energy
Associates in Atlanta.
6.  My software will be the new learning engine of NEA's NOSTRADAMUS
future v5.0
7.  Can verify that I single-handedly wrote NOSTRADAMUS's new training
engine (not yet released)
8.  Am the world's best electric load forecaster using advanced
inductive learning methods.

This is the situation:

I am giving my Final Defense on July 16th in areas of advanced
forecasting methods.  In 1999, I developed highly advanced neural
network models for Commonwealth Edison, under Robert Abboud (working at
ComEd) through the Adaptive Computing Lab at Iowa State University.  The
models were the most accurate available.  At the time, ComEd was using
the EPRI models, NEA's Nostradamus, Tesla, and the ISU models (those
that I developed).  Still, I knew of many ways for improvement and have
been waiting for my graduation to release this technology.  Preliminary
studies show that my most recent work is more accurate than anything
that is available at any price.

Since I have felt oppressed by the system (being a student), I have
awaited graduation (am finished mid-July) to unleash the technology that
I have developed outside of the university (my funding comes from the
Meteorology department and has nothing to do with load forecasting).
This is unpublished, provocative, state-of-the-art stuff that can smoke
even the multi-million dollar EPRI models, and only I know how they
work.  The technology could also put Tesla out of business.  The errors
appear to be LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE OF NOSTRADAMUS.

John Snead from Tesla knows me and feared my models so much that he
tried to merge his company with RGA Labs.  Robert Abboud from ComEd,
Excelon (and now RGA Labs) knows who I am.  Rick Hunt, the project
manager from New Energy Associates does also, since I wrote the software
for their yet-to-be-released inductive learning engine.

Ok.  Here are the possibilities.

1.  I am making all of this up and did't really invent leading
forecasting technology
2.  I am a nut who doesn't even know what he's talking about
3.  This guy couldn't possibly do this sort of thing on his own clock
all by himself
4.  Maybe there's something to what this guy is saying.  We might as
well send him a data set to test his claims.


I feel that someone will continue to try to take advantage of me if I
don't act now.  Within the next 6 months, someone will probably own my
technology besides myself.  I want to prove that I can be an immense
asset to Enron.  I would like to sell my technology to Enron as part of
your in-house modeling efforts.

Someone else might come along and try to make the same claims that I am
making.  They might razzle-dazzle you with their marketing sense and
ability to sell you their gem.

What I am saying is that if you give me a chance to show you what I can
do, if you care about accuracy and not razzle-dazzle, then I will not
disappoint you.  Give a data set to me and a thousand other people and
companies.  Let me show you that I'm not making all of this up.  I will
show you flaws in other "gems".

I hope this email wasn't too long.  My family & I, as of now, have a
fairly uncertain financial future (until I enter the workforce and have
a fairly cushy job).  Because of this, I am obligated to see what
opportunities exist with my intellectual property.  If I fail in
convincing Enron that I have a gold mine in my possession, then I will
go to the #2 spot on my list, and will offer to provide them with the
leading forecasting package available today.  In some way, shape or
form, in this scenario my software will then compete with Enron.

Thank you for lending me your ear.  I hope you don't think I'm a lunatic
for sending you this lengthy email.

Craig Carmichael

as the SCC company representative for the purposes of this matter? Sami,  if
this is right I would have no objections for you signing these documents, but
you don't have any position with SCC. Weren't these to be give n to Nate

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


"Plan B"
As folks know, there's a group of moderate Democrats in the CA Assembly that
has been working on a "Plan B."
They've been working on it because they're not satisfied with the Governor's
MOU with Edison.
The Plan B group has been talking to a broad array of stakeholders, including
Republicans, to get input into how "Plan B" can improve upon the MOU.
First the good news about Plan B:  a fairly bright group of legislators is
rolling up its sleeves and attempting to come up with a centrist solution to
the problem, and they're at least creating the appearance of trying to be
bi-partison about it.  (There is at least one idea in Plan B that is
attributable to a Republican--Keith Richman--that Ken Lay met with a couple
of weeks ago.) So the beginnings of a process to resolve California's crisis
may be emerging.
Now the bad news:  because they are trying to build a consensus, Plan B is a
mish-mash, isn't focused, includes some pretty bad ideas, excludes some good
ideas (like re-establishing Direct Access immediately), and is going to
require a lot more work to get right.
Update on Efforts to Achieve a Settlement
In the meeting with the suppliers that Steve Kean and I participated in
yesterday, one of the financial consultants hired by the Governor criticized
several of the Plan B proposals as unworkable.
On today's call with the Governor's staff and suppliers it became somewhat
apparent that the Governor isn't going drive a resolution, but will leave it
to the Legislature to take the lead role.
The staff emphasized repeatedly that the lawsuits, investigations, etc. were
not on the table for discussion in any global settlement talks, and that
attempting to bring them in to the negotiations was a nonstarter.
Instead, the Governor's staff said that the group should focus on the size of
the discount that suppliers would be willing to take.
The suppliers pushed back, stating that including haircuts in the talks while
excluding the lawsuits, investigations, etc. is one-sided and unworkable.
The staff urged the group to begin negotiations with the Legislature, but
made it fairly clear that the Governor would not be the one to pull the
necessary principals together in a room to hammer out a solution; his staff
implied instead that it's up to others, i.e., the suppliers, to get the
process of negotiations underway.
Next Steps
If the Governor's financial consultants are prepared by Friday, they will
brief suppliers on the ways in which the administration is attempting to
resolve the State's creditworthiness issue to encourage suppliers to do power
deals with CDWR.  It they are not ready by Friday, the suppliers will meet
separately to discuss next steps.
Finally, there's been some confusion.  My apologies.
Sandi faxed to Jim and Harry yesterday a copy of "Plan B."  Sandi mentioned
that the Governor gave the Plan B group an analysis of the Plan.  For those
that have a copy of Plan B, see the 10-page memo dated May 12th, attached to
the back of the Plan.  The memo is from Joe Fichera to John Dutra, Fred
Keeley and Joe Nation (3 of the Plan B Democratic legislators).  Joe Fichera
is the head of Saber Partners, a financial consulting group that the Governor
hired to advise him on the crisis.
If anyone has not yet received a copy of Plan B, please let me know and I'll
get it to you.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I wanted to inform you of an investment opportunity with Shawn Gross.

He planning on developing a 2.5-acre tract at the corner of Kirby &  Braeswood.  This location as you know is close to the medical center area  and surrounded quality old neighborhoods.  Two apartments in the area have  been very successful.  The Providence across the street is getting rental  rates in the $1.22 per square foot and Kirby Place, an older apartment complex,  is getting $1.13 per square foot.

The preliminary plan is to develop three or four story structures with a  total of approximately 110 or 150 units, respectively.  The total  project cost are projected to be $8.1 million or $10.9 million.  Capital  required for this development is between $1.6 million (for the three story  development) and $2.2 million (for the four story development).  An  additional call later on during development could be around $200,000 due to  increasing costs (i.e, increase in lumber prices).  The property would  probably be completed 18 months out.  Projected IRRs are between 20% to 28%  depending on the sale of the property.  Return on Cash Invested starts at  approximately 11% in 2002 and increases steadily up 20% around 2006.   Assumptions are: $1.22 per square foot rents; revenues & expenditures rising  3.5%; vacancy loss of 5%; Cap Rate of 8.5%; total project cost between $8.1  million and $10.9 million, depending on three or four stories.  There is an  issue with the property being in the 100-Year Floodplain, but he is proposing to  alleviate the problem by creating a water feature on the property and raise the  grade of builderable area above the Floodplane.

I spoke to Jenard about the project before I've been able to discuss it  further with Shawn.  I asked him about some of the assumptions, such  as the rental rates and cap rates which I thought where a bit aggressive.   He told me to the contrary, that Shawn's other project is pulling in  similar rates, as well as other non-Shawn projects.  With regards to the  cap rate, he said that he has been seeing 8%, which would call for a greater  sales price than the assumed 8.5% (I can discuss this in further detail for  anyone who doesn't understand cap rates).  Jenard is investing 15% of  the capital required as a limited partner (same terms as the rest of the  partners) and Shawn is investing 5% (4% as a limited partner, 1% as GP).   Shawn will be the developer, JMG Builders will be doing the construction, and  JMG Managers, Ltd. will be managing the property.  In otherwords, Dad will  have his construction company and management company doing the project.   Shawn will be the developer.  While the property is under operation there  should be distributions (not treated as capital returned).  At the time of  sale, mortgage refinance, or other capital event, after all debts have been  repaid, all of the partners will get their capital contribution back.   Then, profits are distributed.  I can go through the partnership structure  for those who are interested, which includes distributions and fees.

I am considering investing in 1% to 2% of the deal.  A 1% percent  investment amounts to either $16,000 or $22,000 invested, depending on the three  or four story scenario, plus the possible additonal cash call of $2,000.   There are several risks (i.e., softening of rental rates) which dooesn't make  the returns a guarantee.  However, I feel good about the Houston  economy and absorption rates in the residental (and commercial) markets for  Houston.  Feedback from Jenard regarding his developments in  Houston and Steve Keller's South Rice Apartment development have all been  extremely positive.  Shawn's personal developments include:  one in  Houston completed and doing great;  the other Houston project never got  developed because someone offered him so much money on the land, he and his  partners had to take it (not a bad problem considering it took the risk out of  developing and returned an enormous IRR to the investors).  Although he has  not developed much, his father is an investor and will have some  involvement.  Money invested would be tied-up for at least two years  (unless something happens like his last project), but up until a sale which  could take between 2 to 5 years (or longer) there could be distributions.   That assumes that the project is doing well.

Anyway, please let me know if any of you are interested.  The deal  is scheduled to fund June 10.  Like I said, I have not heard from him  on all the specifics.  Therefore, I don't know at this time how much is of  the deal is even available.  I would be glad to discuss this in greater  detail with any of you that are interested.

- Beau

We would not want to allow this so early in the process when there is still some 6 weeks to signing and the Banks have not obtained final credit approval.  I have spoken to Nevin and reminded him of this understanding and he agrees that introducing uncertainty in the market this far ahead of signing is not beneficial for either the buyer or the seller.  He will speak to Jason Perkins and explain.

To  MOM ...in Seattle, Washington
From your  daughter...Abigail...in Los Angeles
Dear Mom: As I watch the  inaugural, I am still
crushed that Al Gore
did not get in office. Look at  that Texas jerk with
the cowboy hat on!!
What a disgrace. And look how  immoral he is...getting
a ticket for
drunken driving 24 years  ago!!
And....aren't you so excited? Jesse Jackson has a
new  child !! I sent
him $5.  I used to send him $50...but my electric  bill
was $2,345 last
month, and I was short of cash. That is not  bad,
though...Susan's bill
was $3000 because she has a TWO-bedroom  apartment. I
am hoping to meet
Jesse's new girl friend out here. I think  she is
living with his other
girl friend from 1996. (Or maybe it was the  1994
one.... I forgot.)
I love California...everything is  so
"environmentally correct" here.
And all our liberal friends are in  power now. I am
sure glad we
demonstrated against building all those power  plants 8
years ago...or
else this state would be polluted like Texas  and
Georgia.  My friends
and I are going out tomorrow to demonstrate  against
that nuclear power
plant they recently re-opened. We shut that  down in
1994, and I think
some Republican sons of b------ are re-opening  it.
Probably just to keep
the businesses going. GEEZ!!
Well...don't call me on Mondays, Wednesdays, or
Fridays because those
are  the designated days with no electricity. Not on
Tuesdays or
Thursdays  either...because those are the designated
days with no water
or  phones.  Call me on Saturday between 3 and 4
PM....usually we  have
power then. I don't understand why states with lots of
power like  Texas
and Georgia don't try to help us out.
We won't have to  worry much longer about pollution
because all the
businesses are shutting  down, and there is no jet fuel
for the
airlines.  And gas is $8.50 a  gallon...so no one can
afford to drive.
I LOVE California !!  Thank God for the Democrats !!
Love... your  daughter,
Abigail

CONFIDENTIAL
Sue,
I talked to Tim Belden briefly about this filing.  He thinks it is a bit of a
losing battle but is supportive or a coalition (e.g., WPTF or IEP) protest.
Other comments from him were:
(As you noted) the ISO should require PG&E and SCE to file letters of credit,
rather than state that they did not come forward.
The DWR should not be setting the terms of what it will take to provide
credit; the ISO (and FERC) shoudl be.\
If DWR is given access to nonpublic data and real time trading information.
other creditworthy parties that are net short should also be afforded similar
access.
Hope this helps.

It is important to clarify that Ms. Cunha shall be representing EPCB in

Unfortunately, these documents have to be filed before court in their

Summary of the activities since Friday:

Overall, it's 50-50 or better that the Legislature will finish up the budget and recess until August 20th, without having passed some form of an "Edison MOU." Will have a better view of the chances of getting an MOU agreed to and passed through both houses by COB Monday.

In the Senate:
The "Edison MOU":
As previously reported, on Friday, SB 78---the Senate's version of the Edison MOU--passed out of the full Senate and was sent to the full Senate.
The bill sticks 100% of suppliers' debts with Edison's shareholders but pays QFs and other creditors.
The authors believe that suppliers can't force Edison into bankruptcy because the claims are with the PX, not Edison, which in their view means that the suppliers can't reach Edison.  Our lawyers need to assess whether the tactic is strong from a legal perspective.
The bill creates an option to buy the transmission system, but rejects the Goernor's MOU, which buys it outright.
Though there's some uncertainty, the bill appears to end Direct Access.
Information we have indicates that the Assembly does not support and will not pass SB 78 in its current form.
Enron (and the marjority of market participants) opposes 78.

The "Dunn Investigation":
Dunn released his report regarding contempt charges against Enron on Saturday.
The report recommends that the Senate fine us, beginning with $1,000 the first day, and doubling everyday thereafter until Enron "complies."
Dunn announced on Saturday that he would attempt to bring the report to the full Senate for a vote on Saturday.
In response, our lobbyist in Sacramento spoke to a leader of the Republican party in the Senate (Ross Johnson), and persuaded Johson to negotiate the date of the vote with Burton and Dunn.
She was successful---Johnson went to Burton and got him and Dunn to agree not to vote on the report until the Senate returned from its recess on August 20th.
If the Senate returns early, it could vote prior to the 20th, but the likelihood of that happening appears low at this time.

The budget:
The Senate passed the budget at about 1 AM Sunday morning.
The Senate adjourned for recess after the vote and is not expected to return until August 20th.
That leaves the Assembly alone in Sacramento to do its part regarding the budget and the Edison MOU.

The Assembly
In short, leadership within the Assembly is extremely weak and without much influence over its own party--the Democrats.
The Speaker is viewed as having botched both the budget and the energy issue.
Unable to do a deal, the Assembly recessed Saturday night and has not reconvened.
It has therefore not taken the votes needed to finish up with the budget.
The Assembly also has not passed its version of an Edison MOU, which it says it intends to do.
Best information we have right now is that the Assembly does not plan to go back into session until Tuesday morning.
Late Saturday night, the Assembly Speaker released yet another version of his Edison MOU (AB 82XX), but it does not appear at this time that he has enough votes among Assembly Democrats to pass it.
Enron--together with business customers--opposes the version of 82XX released on Saturday night because it does not adequately ensure Direct Access.

Best,
Jeff

As part of Project Ranger, it is my goal to have a single repository to house all actual data, allowing users to access data through an ad hoc reporting tool.  Additionally, as areas identify needs, I would hope that we can develop feeds rather than just ad hoc reporting.

We are setting up a meeting with CSC for this Wednesday to discuss the needs and start defining Iteration 2 of the project.  Vivian forwarded me this meeting that you have already set-up.  My question:  Without knowing the full scope of your efforts, I'd like to propose a single initiative to obtain actuals.  Additionally, we wanted to set-up this meeting for Wednesday when the CSC business analyst is in town.  Do you think it would be advantageous to combine the meetings, and schedule it for Wednesday?

We will move forward with our efforts and will schedule a meeting for Wednesday.  If you all want to combine efforts, please let me know and we will include you on the meeting.

Chris - I had already included both you and Murray on the invitation listing.  Will you forward this E-mail to him?  I'm having problems trying to call up his E-mail address.

Please let me know.

Citizens is going to sign the agency and operating agreement today.  TW will be taking over the operations
and monitoring the Griffith plant on Citizens behalf.  We will be monitoring the alarms at the plant and you have
a call out sheet for Citizens personnel.  We also will be responsible for the operations at the plant.  Currently
in Scada we have Griffith Power Plant El Paso and Griffith Power Plant TW.  Please get familiar with the points
and how set points will need to be sent.  To change El Paso, the set point will be at 1.  TW will be at 2.
When you send flow set points of 140,000 that will automatically convert to pressure control.  Set points less than
140,000 will stay on flow control.  We will have to experiment with set points when we have orders on TW and
El Paso.  Currently we have orders just off of TW.

1.  Currently El Paso is set on 140,000 flow which will control on pressure and TW flow set point is at 120,000.
this is on flow control.
2.  When we have a flow order from El Paso we may want to set them on flow control and TW on pressure.   We
will just have to experiment with the best operation.
3.  Remember the above mentioned is at the plant and not at the TW Mainline I/C.  We are working with Citizens
to be able to see El Paso Mainline I/C.(El Paso will be responsible for the Mainline I/C and setpoints.)

I put a copy of the agreement in everyone's inbox for your review.
If you have questions we can get with Craig Lipke with Citizens and ask for their help.  Last conversation with him
was we would just have to operate and see which scenario best fits the situation.  In other words they really don't
know which is the best way to operate.

Thanks DS

Well, my holiday has almost ended and it has been both enjoyable and
memorable.  I have met so many cool people over here, and seen so many
awesome places.

Since the time of my last writing, I spent five days sailing around the
Mediterranean with six other auzzies and kiwis.  The boat wasn't very full,
and we had four crew members to ensure the seven of us were adequately fed
and rested.  Morning started with breakfast, and was followed by long spells
of sleeping, reading and swimming.  It reminded me alot of Torys cabin,
except I didn't have to cook or clean the dishes (Tory, work on it...).  It
was difficult to get off the boat, and the group spent several days
afterwards laying around and doing next to nothing to ease ourselves back
into the real world.

After the sailing, we spent four days in this awesome little town called
Fethiye, and visited places such as the blue lagoon and hiked up to a
waterfall in the Valley of the Butterflys.  We also went to a hike in this
gorge, that was completely incredible.  At this point in the holiday, I was
quite happy for the lax safety standards over here, because we climbed up
many places in the gorge using nothing but the old ropes that someone had
conveniently tied in place.  In one spot, we even had to climb vertically up
a rope through a small waterfall!

I was quite pumped to head to this place called Olympos, where they have
these treehouses to sleep in, but let the others go a day ahead while I
finished my stuff in Fethiye.  When I got to Olympos, there wasn't much to
do and one of the guys was pretty sick, so I only stayed the evening, and we
carried on to the next place.  In hindsight, my decision to arrive late and
leave early was a good one, because I was the only one of the seven who
didn't end up getting really ill, whew!

We spent several days in this quant little village in the middle of the
country, waiting for everyone to get better to travel, then headed to this
place called Cappadocia, where they have these awesome hoodoo type rocks
everywhere.  After arriving, I went exploring some really old churches
carved into these rocks with a couple of girls from the hostel.  On the way
home, we decided that hitchin would be easier than waiting for the bus, and
met some really nice turkish men who were looking for a couple of nice
women.  After several detours and a long journey, we were able to talk them
into taking us back into town!  Last time I hitchhike in Turkey.

The next day, I headed off to explore the valley with the group of people
from the sailboat.  We got lost for a while, and found an awesome house
carved into this rock (kinda like a cavehouse).  It was many stories high,
and we went exploring and ended up on the roof of the house, which was at
the top of the valley.  I also got to sleep in one of these caves at the
pansion where I was staying, which was quite a treat considering the caves
are quite cool, and it was smoking hot outside!  The next day, we went to
take a tour that we had arranged through another hotel, and ended up getting
pulled over by the Jandarma (Turkeys version of the special police force).
Turns out that our guide wasn't certified, and that we weren't supposed to
be with him.  After a while of waiting, and some discussion, we were driven
back to town and refunded our money.  We ended up finding another guide, and
toured an underground city, saw some thousand year old churches, and saw
where they filmed some scenes of the first starwars.

Our final day in Cappadocia, and one I will never forget, was quite scary.
After a long hard night of partying in the Flintstones Cave Bar for my
sendoff party (the others were going another direction and I was heading to
Istanbul), we got up and decided to go for a hike down this place called the
pigeon valley.  There were five of us, including two other auzzies that we
had met the day before (four girls and one guy).  We hiked down this valley,
and ended up coming to a very steep section that we had to climb down.  It
wasn't very safe, and we were all pretty worried, but figured it was the
only way down.  The girl was crouching on this thin trail, and slipped.  She
ended up sliding down this rocky/sandy slope about twenty five feet on her
belly, and managed to stop herself on the edge of a thirty foot cliff, all
while the rest of us watched in horror.  A turkish guide had just shown up
before she slipped, and he helped to get her back up an to safety.  Myself
and another guy ended up climbing back up the rest of the cliff (we were
only partway down), and found another turkish guide who led us down an
easier way.  She was pretty shaken up, and had taken all of the skin off her
elbows, knees, and finger tips (trying to gain a hold).  We got her back to
town and spent several hours cleaning her up.  The two of them then came
with me to Istanbul, and hopped on a plane back to London.  Very crazy!

The last couple of days I have been in Istanbul, and have seen the Royal
palace, several really old mosques, and some amazing jewels (if you like 86
carat diamonds), and the bones of St. John the Baptiste.  I am going to tour
again tomorrow, and maybe shop a little, then head back home to Calgary.
Will see you all then!

Take Care!
Jeff

Transmission lines project draws bidders
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published July 24, 2001)
Aiming to ease one of the festering problems in California's energy crisis,
13 companies and public agencies have bid for the right to widen a notorious
bottleneck in the state's transmission lines, federal officials said Monday.
The bidders range from the East Bay Municipal Utility District to wholesale
power generators such as Mirant Corp., Calpine Corp. and Williams Cos. Some
independent experts argue that if a generator wins the bid, it could use its
control over those transmission lines to manipulate the electricity market.
The bottleneck is Path 15, a narrow 90-mile stretch of power lines near Los
Banos that carries electricity between Northern and Southern California. It
has less transmission capacity than other portions of the power grid, which
has led to blackouts.
In January, Northern California suffered power outages in part because Path
15 couldn't deliver the surplus electricity that was available in Southern
California. The proposed expansion would add 1,500 megawatts of capacity.
"It's a very big issue; there's been a lot of congestion," said Severin
Borenstein of the University of California Energy Institute.
In addition, the Independent System Operator, which manages the power grid,
estimates the congestion generated by Path 15 added an estimated $221.7
million to California's power bill in a 16-month period that ended in
December.
Borenstein said he believes there are considerable hidden costs as well,
because the bottleneck has created an incentive for sellers to withhold
power. Path 15 effectively cuts California into two separate markets, making
it easier for sellers to manipulate each submarket to raise prices, he said.
Pacific Gas and Electric Co., which owns the existing Path 15 transmission
lines, already has been conducting environmental studies with an eye toward
widening the path. To speed things along, the federal government in May asked
for bids on the project, which sparked proposals from generators and others.
Borenstein said having a generator widen Path 15 could bring new problems.
Whoever builds the additional power lines owns them and can charge "tolls" to
companies that use the lines to transmit electricity. A power generator could
deliberately withhold supplies, thereby increasing the congestion on Path 15,
and increase the tolls, Borenstein said.
PG&E is among those bidding to widen the path. So is its sister company, an
unregulated entity called PG&E National Energy Group. Other bidders include a
partnership led by Sempra Energy Resources, an unregulated sister company of
San Diego Gas & Electric Co.
The federal government estimates it will take $300 million and three or four
years to widen Path 15. The costs are ultimately paid by utility customers.
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, speaking to reporters in Los Angeles
on Monday, called the expansion of Path 15 "a critical component in solving
the long-term power crisis in this state."

Dan Walters: Blame game over California's energy crisis will continue for
years


(Published July 24, 2001)
The wrestling match between politicians and Enron Corp. moved into a more
intense arena over the weekend when a state Senate investigating committee
sought contempt penalties because the huge energy company has refused to turn
over internal documents.
Although Houston-based Enron owns no major power plants in California, it has
adopted the toughest stance of all energy companies against the multiple
investigations of why wholesale energy prices spiked so high. And it has
become, in turn, a whipping boy for California politicians.
At one point last spring, state Attorney General Bill Lockyer said he wanted
criminal charges against Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay. "I would love
to personally escort Lay to an 8-by-10 cell that he could share with a
tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey,' " Lockyer said. With
less colorful language, Gov. Gray Davis has often castigated Texas-based
companies as price gougers -- even though Texas firms have been fairly minor
suppliers to California.
Some of it is just buzzword politics. Lockyer and Davis know that
Californians dislike anything associated with Texas, and Lay has been one of
President Bush's major political supporters. Enron, meanwhile, cites the
rhetoric as evidence that Lockyer, Davis and legislative investigators are
interested less in finding the truth than in seeking scapegoats. Enron also
filed a lawsuit challenging the legality of the Senate's subpoenas of trading
data.
Most other energy companies have complied with the demands, creating
Sacramento repositories of the data under elaborate confidentiality
agreements worked out with the special Senate committee headed by Sen. Joseph
Dunn, D-Santa Ana. But Enron has refused, and on Saturday, Dunn submitted a
report asking the Senate for "an appropriate coercive sanction."
Does Enron have something to hide? Or does it sincerely believe that what's
happening in California is political scapegoating? Are the companies' fears
about the confidentiality of the data sought by the Senate justified? Would
data be selectively leaked to show the firms in the worst light? Would data
be used by competitors? Or could the information find its way into the hands
of class-action attorneys?
Dunn, a prominent trial attorney himself, insists that confidentiality will
be protected and that the information being sought is only for legislative
purposes. But Enron and the other companies have some reason to be wary of
turning over confidential information to politicians. Similar information was
leaked -- without penalty -- in last year's investigation of former state
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. And there are indications that
private lawyers are working closely with investigators.
Mike Aguirre, the San Diego attorney seeking a "smoking gun" to prove
collusion among energy companies, supplied Dunn's committee with a few
dissident Duke Energy workers who alleged, in highly publicized hearings,
that the firm had manipulated production at its San Diego plant to create
artificial shortages and drive up spot market power prices. Duke then refuted
the charges by releasing some excerpts from the records of the Independent
System Operator, the controller of California's power grid, indicating that
ISO had ordered the plant operational changes.
Aguirre subsequently asked the governor's office to pressure the ISO -- now
under Davis' direct control -- to release all of the Duke-related documents
that would show, he says, that the firm actually manipulated the situation.
Duke and other companies insist that the ISO-held documents are proprietary.
Aguirre pleaded with one Davis adviser in an e-mail that "we need your help
in properly getting this information out." But Aguirre, in an interview, said
he had not yet obtained cooperation from Davis aides.
The political and legal struggle to affix blame for California's energy woes
will continue for months, perhaps years. The crisis will cost ratepayers at
least $50 billion, and they'll want to know why as they make out their
utility bill checks.

Initiative effort seeks to lower natural-gas prices
By Jim Miller
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 24, 2001)
Amid higher utility rates, the threat of rolling blackouts and legislative
indecision on how to solve California's energy problems, there is one
proposal to get voters involved.
A ballot initiative to let cities, counties and other public agencies, such
as municipal utilities and irrigation districts, buy and sell natural gas has
been cleared for signature collection by the secretary of state's office.
The initiative emerged from the office of Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza,
D-Merced, whose district includes three electricity-supplying irrigation
districts.
To Cardoza and others, putting public agencies in the natural-gas business
would result in lower gas and electricity prices for consumers because most
generators run on natural gas.
Cardoza's proposal is the first of what observers say could be several
energy-related measures on future ballots.
For months, consumer advocates have warned that they would use the initiative
process if they feel lawmakers are saddling taxpayers with the costs of the
state's botched energy deregulation.
"As soon as we find out what the Legislature has done or has not done this
fall, we'll react appropriately," said Jamie Court, executive director of the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the groups considering an
initiative.
"If there's a bailout (of utilities), we'll go to the ballot box. If there
isn't a bailout, it's not clear what we'll do," Court said. "Right now, we're
fund raising to be able to have the capacity to do whatever needs to be
done."
The future of Cardoza's initiative is uncertain.
Since its approval by the secretary of state's office May 29, there has been
no effort to collect signatures or to raise money for a campaign. The
initiative needs the signatures of 670,816 registered voters by Oct. 26 to
qualify for the ballot.
The electric industry strongly opposes the Cardoza initiative.
"This came about during the winter because it looked like there was going to
be a natural-gas shortage," said Stephanie Espinosa, a spokeswoman for
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. "Since then, we've been able to provide
sufficient natural gas to our customers."
A recent poll, however, showed Californians may be in the mood to approve
energy-related ballot measures. The Public Policy Institute of California
poll found that 65 percent of all adults believe measures on the 2002 ballot
are the best way to solve the energy crisis. Thirty percent said the
Legislature and Gov. Gray Davis would provide the best solution.

Daniel Weintraub: There's no shame in doing nothing for Edison


(Published July 24, 2001)

To understand why state lawmakers are inching closer to handing over billions
of dollars of consumers' money to California's second-largest utility, you
need to appreciate the collective psyche of the Legislature. Not appreciate
as in enjoy. But appreciate in a scientific way, in the manner of an
anthropologist studying the mores of a foreign culture.
Confronted with a big problem, legislators think they need to solve it. Doing
nothing is not a comfortable option. It makes them feel ineffective and
impotent. When the governor is demanding a bill, the pressure grows even more
intense. They want to do something -- anything -- rather than having to go
back to their districts and admit that the problem is not theirs to fix.
In this case, though, doing nothing might be the wisest course.
Lawmakers now have on their desks three bills that take various approaches to
rescuing Southern California Edison from the brink of bankruptcy. The company
has a $3.5 billion debt left over from the state's failed experiment in
electricity deregulation. If something isn't done about it in the next few
weeks, the utility's future is likely to wind up in the hands of a judge.
But all three bills ignore a fundamental fact: Edison got itself into this
mess. Maybe the utility should get itself out.
Edison was a big cheerleader for the 1996 bill that restructured the way
electricity was bought and sold in California. Supporting a freeze on retail
rates, which was the centerpiece of that legislation, the company took a huge
gamble. If wholesale prices remained low, Edison would rake in billions by
capturing the difference between the price it paid for power and the much
higher price it was allowed to charge its customers. The money would go to
compensate the utility for power plants it built as a regulated monopoly,
plants that might no longer be profitable in a free-market, competitive
industry.
Like all gambles, this one came with a risk. If wholesale prices rose, they
might exceed the retail rate cap. Edison would be forced to sell its
electricity at retail for less than it was paying in the wholesale market.
The tide of dollars that flowed in so nicely would begin to flow back out
again.
And that's exactly what happened. Some of the world's smartest utility minds
guessed wrong. An electricity surplus turned into a shortage. Wholesale
prices soared. Things got so bad at Edison that the state stepped in to buy
power on the company's behalf.
But before things got ugly, Edison enjoyed two flush years of artificially
high rates. During 1998 and 1999, the company pocketed billions from its
customers, paid down debt and sent money to its parent firm, Edison
International.
Now Edison wants to divide the question. The money that flowed in, Edison
says, the company should get to keep. And the money that flowed out -- well,
that should be someone else's responsibility. The utility is asking the
Legislature to ignore the first two years of hefty profits and reimburse the
company for the one year of big losses.
Gov. Gray Davis negotiated his version of the Edison bailout several months
ago, but that deal was seen as so rich for the company that it went nowhere
in the Legislature. The Senate approved its version last week, a bill that
would reduce the payout to Edison by $1 billion and then stick business with
the remaining tab. The Assembly, meanwhile, is considering two other
measures, both of which would spread the pain between business and
residential consumers.
"This is corporate welfare at its worst," state Sen. Bill Morrow,
R-Oceanside, said of the Senate bill. "This is not even a bailout. It's a
corporate handout."
Edison and the state's other big utility, Pacific Gas & Electric, which is
already in bankruptcy, say they are entitled to the money because they never
should have been put in the position of charging less for electricity than
they were paying to obtain it. That's a legal argument that belongs before a
judge. There is a good chance the court would want to balance the profits the
utilities made under deregulation with the losses they incurred. Under that
scenario, they wouldn't need a bailout.
But even if the utilities were to win their case, consumers probably would
fare no worse than they would under the various legislative proposals under
consideration.
Sen. Steve Peace, D-San Diego, who helped craft the 1996 bill that
restructured the industry and who now supports the Edison bailout, lectured
his fellow senators on the floor the other day about the need to take a risk.
"We can do nothing and be safe," Peace said. "Or we can do something, and do
our job."
Everyone is weary of the state's energy crisis. It is human nature to want to
get it behind us, to sweep it away, even at great cost. But lawmakers
shouldn't feel it's their job to "do something" -- especially when that thing
carries a multibillion-dollar price tag for consumers.
This time, doing nothing means standing up for ratepayers. What's the shame
in that?

State consultants don't see need for more rate hikes


\
objattph
Outlook brightens; price cut may be possible by 2003 By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 23, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- State consultants,
releasing a new estimate of power costs with an improved outlook, said
yesterday they do not believe an additional rate increase will be needed --
and a rate cut may be possible by 2003.  The state issued a long-awaited
"revenue requirement" asking for a little more than half of the revenue from
a record rate increase imposed by the state Public Utilities Commission
earlier this year.  The state power-purchasing agency, the Department of
Water Resources, wants 1.65 cents of an increase of 3 cents per kilowatt-hour
that began last month for customers of Pacific Gas and Electric and Southern
California Edison.
The PUC is not expected to rule on the state's revenue request until the
middle of next month, when the regulators also are scheduled to approve an
increase for the customers of San Diego Gas & Electric.  PG&E and Edison did
not immediately say whether the state's proposal would leave enough money for
the utilities. But as if expecting criticism, the state consultants said
utilities often ask for larger rate increases than they are granted.  An
adviser to Gov. Gray Davis said the administration was "mocked" by critics
when it forecast in April that the average cost of power would drop during
the summer, even though heat would drive up the demand for power.  "Quote:
'They just don't know what they are doing,' " consultant S. David Freeman
recalled the critics saying. "Well, we did know what we were doing. Quite
frankly, I think this is a good-news story of major proportions."  The widely
derided forecast issued in April said the average cost of power that must be
purchased on the expensive spot market would drop from $346 per megawatt-hour
in April through June to $195 in July through September.  Now the "reasonably
conservative" estimate is that the average price of power in July through
September will be $129 to $130 per megawatt-hour, said Ron Nichols of
Navigant Consulting.  Nichols attributed the price drop to a number of
factors: long-term contracts, cooler weather, cheaper natural gas used by
generators, more small and large generators back online and floating federal
price caps.  The state began buying power for utility customers Jan. 17 after
PG&E and Edison, whose rates were frozen by deregulation as wholesale power
costs soared, ran up massive debts and were no longer able to borrow.  The
consultants estimated that the state will have spent $13 billion on power by
the end of next year. But they also predicted that the state power-purchasing
fund would develop a substantial surplus by then.  "That would allow for a
rate decrease in 2003, based on our current projections," said Joseph Fichera
of Saber Partners.  The new revenue requirement issued by the state yesterday
is needed for a series of actions planned by the PUC next month to pay for a
record bond issue to repay the taxpayer-supported state general fund for
power purchases.  Fichera said that, despite reports to the contrary, the
recommendation is for a $12.5 billion bond -- leaving a cushion in the
authorization of $13.4 billion. The bond will be paid off by ratepayers over
15 years.  The consultants said their projection of state power costs is
cautious. They assume consumer conservation will drop from 7 percent to 6
percent, though it actually has been 11 percent and 12 percent in recent
months.  The projections are intended to leave some ability to absorb
unforeseen costs, such as scorching temperatures later this summer or next
summer, or a spike in natural gas prices as happened last winter.  The cost
projections do not include any overcharge refund from generators. Davis has
asked federal regulators for an $8.9 billion refund and has vowed to seek
full recovery in the courts.  The governor wants to get the state out of the
power-buying business by the end of next year. But that requires legislative
approval of a rescue plan for Edison that could become a model for getting
PG&E out of bankruptcy.  The Senate, which left for a monthlong recess after
approving a state budget early yesterday, approved an Edison rescue plan that
the utility says is too weak to restore its ability to borrow.  The Assembly
is struggling with two competing Edison rescue plans. Talks may continue
during the recess in an attempt to reach an agreement before the Aug. 15
deadline set by Davis to reach a deal to keep Edison out of bankruptcy.  The
consultants say there is enough room in the existing rates to give the two
utilities a revenue stream for bonds to pay off their debts -- 0.4 cent per
kilowatt-hour for Edison and 0.7 cent for PG&E.  Fichera said he disagrees
with speculation that falling power prices and the rate increase might give
Edison enough revenue to avoid bankruptcy without a legislative rescue plan.
To pay off Edison's $3.5 billion debt, he said, $2 billion would come from
the bond, but $1.5 billion would have to come from the sale of Edison's
transmission system to the state under the governor's plan.







Senate committee told Morgan Stanley destroyed power records


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 23, 2001  SACRAMENTO ) Morgan Stanley, a multibillion
dollar financial firm and adviser to several power generators, destroyed
documents that potentially could show efforts to gouge California consumers )
and a state Senate committee wants to know why.  The company recently also
has come under the scrutiny of an Oregon lawmaker who is concerned the
company's purchase of the rights to move power between California and Oregon
could result in artificially high prices.  For several weeks, Morgan Stanley
had told the committee it would provide the documents, but said last week
they had been destroyed as a matter of routine "years ago," said Sen. Joe
Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee's chairman.  Members of the committee are
trying to determine whether power companies worked together to raise prices
by purposefully holding back electricity to drive up demand.  Morgan
Stanley's involvement would have been several years ago, when it advised
out-of-state energy companies to buy California power plants up for sale.  A
Morgan Stanley attorney told the Orange County Register that the company did
not destroy any documents after Dunn's committee requested the documents May
16.  "At the end of the project, they decided what they were going to keep
and what they weren't going to keep, and those decisions were made years
before the energy crisis and years before the committee existed," said Paul
Patono, a company attorney.  Dunn noted it is not illegal to raise prices as
long as a company doesn't collude to force prices upward.  Private utilities
became able to sell their plants as part of the 1996 plan to deregulate the
electricity market. Although the plants were expected to sell below their
book value, they instead sold for up to three times that price, although the
state then had an oversupply of electricity and old plants.  While the public
was told deregulation would lead to lower electricity prices, energy
officials and experts testifying before the committee have said it's unlikely
investors would buy aging power plants if they believed that to be true.
Dunn is curious if there was any kind of plan or advertising that said the
plants, if bought a certain way, would give of the buyers market power in the
wholesale electricity market.  The committee is still moving forward with
contempt proceedings against Houston-based power marketers Enron Corp. and
Reliant Energy for refusing to hand over documents to committee
investigators.  New York-based Morgan Stanley, now Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
& Co., got into the energy trading in 1984 and now is one of the top 20 U.S.
power marketers.  The company also has come under the scope of Rep. Peter
DeFazio, D-Ore. Morgan Stanley bought the rights to transmit just under a
third of the power flowing between California and Oregon from the Bonneville
Power Administration through February 2002.  DeFazio has written a letter to
the BPA, asking that the agency make sure the Northwest keeps its "reliable,
affordable" energy source.  "The ability of a financial services company,
which has no obligation to serve electricity consumers, to lock up all
available capacity for a year raises serious concerns," DeFazio wrote.  A
company spokeswoman said Morgan Stanley acquired the transmission capacity
from BPA to meet its power delivery obligations in the Northwest, and had no
intention of manipulating the market.








News briefs on the California power crisis


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 24, 2001  IRVINE ) Future Olympic swimmers in Southern
California may no longer have a training facility if the state's power crisis
continues.  Utility bills have jumped significantly over the past couple of
months and aquatic centers across Southern California have felt the pinch.
At Heritage Park in Irvine, home to gold medalist Amanda Beard and silver
medalist Aaron Peirsol, the monthly energy bill has doubled from $7,000 to
between $13,000 and $15,000.  Officials at the Rose Bowl Aquatics Center in
Pasadena have raised membership fees 10 percent to offset electricity costs
that have more than doubled.  The Industry Hills Aquatics Complex in Industry
may close its doors on Sept. 9, in part because of the rate increases.
Gas-powered heaters and electric motors run 24 hours a day at most swimming
centers to keep water temperatures warm. Some swim coaches said a temperature
drop in the pool can hamper an athlete's training regiment and possibly raise
health concerns.  Swimming facilities run on a tight budget, say coaches, and
the soaring energy costs have eaten away any profit margins the training
programs once had.  The Industry Hills facility has even used trash and
methane gas from the landfill it sits on to heat the pool. But the complex
lost about $85,000 last year and operators expect natural gas costs will
double this winter. The property management company, which owns the land, has
given a Sept. 9 deadline to reduce operating costs or close the swimming
center.  ))  CHINO ) The largest of 11 power plants that are supposed to be
built by Sept. 30 under the governor's emergency fast-track program appears
to be running behind schedule.  The concrete foundation hasn't been poured at
the $125-million natural gas facility, which sits near the California
Institution for Men in Chino. The plant, being built by Delta Power Co. of
New Jersey, would supply about 135,000 homes with electricity.
Environmentalists warn that the plant will produce smog five times more than
the legal limit and want state air quality officials, who will conduct a
hearing Tuesday, to deny a final operating permit to Delta Power.  Delta
officials said they hope to meet the Sept. 30 deadline despite the objections
by environmentalists and residents who live near the proposed plant. They
also pledged to install equipment by November that would reduce nitrogen
oxide compounds, which contribute to smog.  If Delta and other energy
companies finish their power plants by the end of September, they receive
incentives such as eliminating environmental analyses and the ability to emit
pollutants for months at levels exceeding state standards.







State sells surplus power at a loss


\
objattph
ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 23, 2001  LOS ANGELES ) State officials sold excess
electricity at a loss of nearly $14 million in the first 16 days of July )
roughly 4.5 percent of the total amount the state spent on power during that
period.  According to the Department of Water Resources, the state purchased
3.5 million megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour. It
sold off 177,000 surplus megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per
megawatt-hour.  Industry officials told the Los Angeles Times it is routine
for utilities and electric companies to at times either sell power at a loss,
work out an exchange or give it away when they find themselves with surplus
power. However, some say this is an indication that the state government does
not belong in the power business.  The sales of surplus power "get to the
issue of, do these people really know what they're doing? Are they really
competent to be managing this to the lowest cost for the ratepayers?" said
Assemblyman John Campbell, R-Irvine. "It reinforces to me that we should get
the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."  Department of
Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details in response to
an inquiry by Campbell.  Assemblyman Roderick Wright, D-Los Angeles, said he
did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.  "Right now the summer is
cool," said Wright, who is also chairman of the Assembly utilities committee.
"If this had been a normal July, we would have used all that power."
Department of Water Resources officials expect the sales to stop if
temperatures heat up later this week.  Department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo
said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the state's
electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a
megawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in
July.  Since January, the state has spent more than $8 billion buying
electricity for the customers of three financially ailing utilities ) Pacific
Gas and Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and
Electric Co.  The state had to take over buying electricity to keep the
state's lights on after federal energy regulators ruled that only
creditworthy entities could buy electricity.







CHINO
Rush for Power Plant in Chino Raises Concerns
Energy: The facility may exceed pollution limits if it begins operations by
Sept. 30. Opponents say that would endanger public health.
By TERENCE MONMANEY
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

CHINO -- Seldom are government bureaucrats criticized for moving too quickly,
but so goes the battle here over a power plant slated for the sun-blasted
grounds of a men's prison.

The proposed plant--big enough to supply 135,000 homes--is one of five in
California that have been licensed to start up despite exceeding pollution
standards as part of Gov. Gray Davis' rush to bring more power online.

The program, covering small to mid-size facilities that run during hours of
peak demand, slashes licensing review from a year to three weeks, eliminates
comprehensive environmental analyses, and authorizes plants to emit
pollutants for months at levels exceeding state and federal air quality laws.
The catch is that the plants must operate by Sept. 30 or those rare and
lucrative incentives could be withdrawn--a possibility confronting developers
of the Chino plant, which a growing number of environmentalists opposes.

So far, with only 69 days left until the deadline, workers haven't poured a
drop of concrete foundation for the $125-million natural gas-burning
facility, developed by Delta Power Co. of New Jersey. The site is on the
outskirts of the California Institution for Men.

The proposed plant, the largest of 11 so-called peakers given expedited
approval, is galvanizing opposition to the governor's emergency fast-track
program. Environmentalists decry the fact that until the plant installs
devices to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds, which contribute to smog, the
level of the pollutant will reach five times the legal limit.

Five groups, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Planning
and Conservation League, have joined in petitioning state air quality
officials to deny the plant a final operating permit. They contend that
excess nitrogen oxides will endanger public health and that the fast-track
process jeopardizes decades of gains against smog.

"We're not necessarily opposed to a power plant on the site," said Gail
Ruderman Feuer, an attorney in the Los Angeles office of the Natural
Resources Defense Council. "We're just opposed to one without environmental
review and without all the pollution controls."

Critics also are wary of the fast-track process because the state has a
vested interest in making sure the plants are built quickly. The Davis
administration has promised to spend billions buying electricity from plants
that aren't built yet.

"It's a massive subterfuge," said Sandra Spelliscy, an attorney with the
Planning and Conservation League in Sacramento.

Jay Roland, manager of the Chino facility for Pegasus Power Partners, a
subsidiary of Delta, said the extra nitrogen oxides released from the plant
for a month or so are "not going to cause damage to anybody."

Roland said he is so frustrated by the "interveners," he sometimes wishes the
whole state would go dark, to underscore the power shortage that the plant is
intended to address.

Though opponents have made a tough job even tougher, he said he hoped to make
the end-of-summer deadline. Missing it could mean applying to the state all
over again under the old rules, he said. "Then I sit here nine months with
$120 million in equipment that's not generating any revenue."

State officials said it was necessary to approve the extra-polluting plants
because of the need to avoid blackouts and because there is a backlog of
emissions-control equipment. Besides, they said, state-of-the-art gas-burning
plants emit fewer pollutants without controls than do many older plants with
them.

Kevin Kennedy, a California Energy Commission official who reviewed the Chino
project, acknowledged that public involvement in the process has suffered
somewhat. "It's been difficult to get the word out . . . to make sure people
in the communities have enough information to know what's going on."

Site Seems Ideal for Power Plant

In many respects, the 11-acre Chino site looks right for a power plant. It
rests on flat surplus land at the northern boundary of the state's largest
prison property, where grasslands cover hundreds of acres.

Half a mile away is a booming warehouse district and a Southern California
Edison substation, which would relay the new power to the transmission grid.

Moreover, Pegasus runs a small power plant on the prison property across a
narrow utility road from the site. Supplying steam and a few megawatts to the
penal institution, the company sells the bulk of its 27 megawatt output to
Edison.

Delta's president, Dean Vanech, bristles at charges that his company doesn't
care about the environment.

He said equipment to reduce nitrogen oxide compounds won't be available until
around November, at which time engineers will work "as quickly as humanly
possible" to install it. Other air pollutants, such as carbon monoxide and
microscopic dust particles, will be controlled from the beginning.

Also, though energy officials reviewed the proposal in a matter of weeks,
they closely scrutinized the company's nine-part application, which took two
months and $1 million to assemble, plant officials say.

The company moved the plant's site after biologists discovered two protected
bird species nesting nearby--burrowing owls and red-tailed hawks. That
required engineers to redesign gas, water and transmission lines and tinker
with the plant structure, Roland said.

Owlets in a nest by a proposed transmission tower still pose an obstacle. "We
have to wait for the babies to leave," construction manager Robert Surette
said.

Key decisions over the plant's future lie with the South Coast Air Quality
Management District, the air pollution agency, which said in May it would
give the Chino plant a construction permit.

But after environmental groups petitioned in late June, the agency asked
Pegasus for more data describing the possible impact of elevated levels of
nitrogen oxides on people in the plant's vicinity.

"We're still in the evaluation phase, and we're not going to prejudge this
project," said district executive director Barry Wallerstein.

He said the plant emissions were probably negligible compared with those from
the parade of diesel trucks in the nearby warehouse district. Those "could be
a larger health hazard to the community than this particular power plant," he
said.

Public Hearing to Be Held Today

The air quality agency has scheduled a public hearing today at its Diamond
Bar office to weigh issuing the plant a waiver needed to exceed state air
quality standards. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has indicated it
will not prosecute the Pegasus plant for temporarily emitting more nitrogen
oxides than the federal Clean Air Act permits.

Vanech of Delta said the company would want to build the plant even if it had
not received expedited approval: "The reason we're doing the project is that
we have a favorable long-term view of the California energy market.'

Delta operates 13 power plants nationwide, five of them in California on
state-controlled property.

The Chino plant promises to benefit this diverse, mostly blue-collar city of
66,000. Although the developer is leasing the property from the state, Delta
agreed to pay the city $500,000 up front, plus $75,000 annually and millions
more over the years in water and natural gas fees.

Vanech said the half-million-dollar "host fee" was compensation to City Hall
for its swift handling of the project's mountainous paperwork and for the
wear and tear that construction crews will cause on city roads.

In the neighborhood closest to the plant, where large new houses rest on
half-acre lots fronted by bridle paths, residents seemed divided.

Jim Tippings, 59, who is retired, said he didn't have a problem with the
plant running a month or so without full nitrogen oxide controls: "I don't
think a month is going to hurt us." Rising utility bills are what really
hurt, he said.

Up the street, 35-year-old Kent Hobbenslefken was not aware that a power
plant was going up a mile away. A former hazardous waste manager who sells
health insurance, he was skeptical of the need to run the generators without
full pollution controls, just to meet a bureaucratic deadline.

"What's a couple of months delay?" he said. "We're already in the crisis.
What's it going to do for John Q. Public? Are our rates going to go down? I
don't think so."

Surplus Power Sold at a Loss
Electricity: Cool summer and effective conservation efforts result in excess
supplies. Industry officials say it's a routine move.
By NANCY VOGEL
TIMES STAFF WRITER

July 24 2001

SACRAMENTO -- Caught with an excess of electricity as a result of cool
weather and heavy conservation, the state government sold power at a loss
approaching $14 million in the first 16 days of July.

The loss amounts to roughly 3.5% of the total amount the state spent on power
during that period.

To keep power flowing to 27 million Californians, the state purchased 3.5
million megawatt-hours at an average price of $118 per megawatt-hour,
according to the state Department of Water Resources. It sold off 177,000
surplus megawatt-hours at an average price of $36.95 per megawatt-hour.
Department of Water Resources Director Thomas Hannigan disclosed the details
in response to an inquiry by Assemblyman John Campbell (R-Irvine).

The sales of surplus power "get to the issue of, do these people really know
what they're doing? Are they really competent to be managing this to the
lowest cost for the ratepayers?" Campbell said. "It reinforces to me that we
should get the state out of doing this as soon as practically possible."

Industry officials, however, say it is routine for utilities and electricity
companies to at times find themselves with more electricity than their
customers need. They either sell the power at a loss, work out an exchange of
power or give it away.

"It's not all that uncommon for utilities to be buying one day and selling
the next," said one Pacific Northwest trader who asked not to be identified
because his company does not permit him to talk to reporters. He said a rule
of thumb in the industry is to match supply to demand within 1% to 2%,
although "5% on a load like California isn't that much."

Assemblyman Roderick Wright (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the Assembly
utilities committee, said he did not see a problem with DWR's power sales.

"Right now the summer is cool," he said. "If this had been a normal July, we
would have used all that power."

"The worm could have turned the other way."

Department of Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said the state's crew
of 15 power purchasers found themselves selling a "very minimal" amount of
electricity in May. In June, more power was sold, but less than was sold in
July, he said. The department has not released those figures.

Department officials expect the sales to stop if temperatures heat up later
this week.

The water department was thrust into the role of buying 30% to 50% of the
state's overall electricity in January after the state's major utilities
became so financially crippled by high wholesale electricity prices that
energy companies refused to sell to them.

The department has so far spent roughly $8 billion of taxpayer money
purchasing power that is sent to the customers of Pacific Gas & Electric,
Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric.

Hidalgo said the sales show that the water department has stabilized the
state's electricity market. The average price the department has paid for a
megawatt-hour is falling, from $271 in May to $119 in June to $89 so far in
July.

"If we were out scrambling for power right now," Hidalgo said, "the market
would reflect that and adjust to it, and we would most likely be paying much
more in overall purchases."

Campbell said he assumes the department sold its most expensive, marginal
megawatts of power. But Hidalgo said that is not necessarily so. The
department does not track what it paid for the power it sells, he said.

The department's statement to Campbell shows sales to 25 different companies,
including the federal Bonneville Power Administration, the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, and several private energy companies that
bought power plants from California's utilities under the state's 1996
deregulation scheme. Those firms include Dynegy Corp., Reliant Energy, Mirant
Corp. and Duke Energy.

Pacific Gas Gets 4-Month Extension on Filing Plan
Bloomberg News

July 24 2001

PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric, California's largest utility, won a
four-month extension to file a Chapter 11 recovery plan free from
interference from creditors and other groups.

The utility's sole right to file a plan was extended from Aug. 6 to Dec. 6.
Creditors, shareholders and others with a stake in the case could have
presented their own plans had the extension not been granted.

Companies reorganizing under Chapter 11 have the sole right to advance a
recovery plan in the first 120 days after filing for bankruptcy. Courts
routinely extend this period in large and complex cases. A committee
representing unsecured creditors in court papers said it "firmly believes
that all parties in interest should move quickly and provide assurance that
any filed plan will pay creditors in full and remedy PG&E's various issues
and problems."

PG&E Corp. shares fell 75 cents to close at to $14.25 on the New York Stock
Exchange.

State sells surplus electricity at a loss
BUY HIGH, SELL LOW: $14 million deficit

California has lost $14 million during the past three weeks selling surplus
electricity back to power generators as mild temperatures and energy
conservation slackened demand statewide.
The state, which has spent more than $8 billion purchasing power on behalf of
financially troubled utilities, became an electricity seller this month,
racking up losses and triggering criticism from Republican lawmakers and
consumer groups.
State Department of Water Resources Director Thomas M. Hannigan said in a
letter that since July 1, the state had sold 177,571 megawatt hours at a rate
of $36.95 each. California paid just over $118 a megawatt hour for the
electricity, Hannigan said in the letter to Assemblyman John Campbell, R-
Irvine.
Some of the exports to 25 buyers went to out-of-state power providers such as
Atlanta-based Mirant and Texas-based Reliant Energy, which a state Senate
committee has found in contempt for not complying with subpoenas for
documents as part of its investigation into alleged price manipulation.
Excess electricity also went to public power agencies such as the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power and even abroad to Powerex, the trading arm of
BC Hydro. The giant Canadian power firm has started issuing rebates to its
customers, citing "strong exports" to California and elsewhere earlier this
year.
"To me this reinforces the idea that the state should get out of the power
buying business as soon as practically possible," Campbell said.
TAXPAYERS GET STUCK
When Pacific Gas & Electric Co. or Southern California Edison makes a similar
mistake, he said, shareholders pay for it. But when the Department of Water
Resources is to blame, taxpayers are left holding the bag.
A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis defended the losses, calling them minuscule
in the bigger context of the state's power-purchasing strategy.
"This is all an inexact science," said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio. "This
has been a handful of days over seven months, and the amount is minuscule. If
the choice is keeping the lights on or having rolling blackouts, it's a small
risk to take."
Because power can't be stored, all power trading operations are occasionally
forced to sell excess electricity, Maviglio said. He said that people would
have laughed in January had the administration predicted that the state would
have more than enough power this summer.
Mild weather and a strong conservation effort by Californians have led to
days when the state hasn't needed all the power it has on hand.
SHARP DROP IN DEMAND
In recent days, the peak load on California's grid has been around 33,000
megawatts -- far below the 40,000-plus megawatt demand that can come on a hot
summer day.
"When we bought power at these prices, who would have thought that it was
going to be the coolest July in 20 years?" said Assemblyman Rod Wright, D-Los
Angeles. "The problem becomes when you second-guess things."
The state Department of Water Resources has negotiated about $43 billion
worth of electricity contracts spanning 15 to 20 years. The contracts were
made public after media organizations, including The Chronicle, and GOP
lawmakers sued the Davis administration.
Consumer groups yesterday criticized the losses, calling them an inevitable
byproduct of the state's entry into the power-buying business.
"It's one of the costs of secrecy. You've got an agency that is totally
unaccountable to the public," said Doug Heller, a consumer advocate with the
Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "They haven't done a great job
of serving the public's needs for energy procurement."
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, said Campbell and other critics
were not being fair to the Davis administration.
"You can't say at one time get the energy situation under control, but then
question every line item a month out," she said.

San Diego tries to undo the damage
THE PLAN: Regional public power
David Lazarus, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:dlazarus@sfchronicle.com>

San Diego -- This city, which was first to bear the brunt of the state's
energy crisis a year ago as electricity bills tripled, is now aiming to be
first with a long- term solution: regional public power.
A bill is making its way through the Legislature -- and being fought at every
turn by the power industry -- to make San Diego County one of the largest
municipal utility districts in the nation.
If the measure fails, San Diego officials intend to refashion the local water
authority as an alternative utility hub that would construct efficient new
plants and steal business away from costlier, decades-old facilities owned by
out-of-state generators.
Some consumer advocates believe that San Diego's efforts could serve as a
model for large-scale public power systems in Northern California.
"If we can pull this off, we can bring down prices and show the way to energy
independence," said Rep. Bob Filner, D-San Diego. "If we don't change the
rules, we're going to be back where we were."
It won't be easy, though. Even if San Diego can overcome vigorous opposition
from power companies, its public-power scheme still could run afoul of Gov.
Gray Davis, who is counting on statewide revenue to finance next month's
municipal bond offering, the largest in U.S. history. Going its own way as a
municipal utility district would mean San Diego could avoid purchasing
electricity from the state Department of Water Resources, thus reducing the
flow of cash into California's coffers.
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for the governor, said Davis would not take a
position on San Diego's public-power bill until it cleared the Legislature.
"But the governor would obviously look extremely carefully at anything that
would affect revenue to pay off the bonds," he said.
Twelve months after California's energy crisis first erupted in San Diego,
leading to statewide blackouts and financial catastrophe for utilities,
residents of this city, to a large extent, have tried to put last summer's
difficulties behind them.
San Diego Gas & Electric Co., owned by Sempra Energy, had been the first of
California's three investor-owned utilities to pay off outstanding debts and
thus qualify for a lifting of the rate freeze that accompanied deregulation
of the state's power market.
Unfortunately for San Diegans, wholesale electricity prices suddenly
skyrocketed, and San Diego Gas & Electric was free to pass along its rising
costs directly to consumers.
Customers of Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and Southern California Edison were
still protected by the rate freeze and thus saw no changes in their power
bills -- although the two utilities, in turn, were forced to absorb about $14
billion in unrecovered expenses.
San Diego power rates subsequently were limited by state regulators to
restore stability to the local market -- but not before many residential and
business customers saw their monthly bills go through the roof.
"I'm still paying almost double what I was paying before," said George
Aguilar, owner of a downtown jewelry store. "We should talk to lawyers and
sue the people in the government responsible for this. It was pure
negligence."
WELL-INFORMED POLITICIANS
In fact, San Diego's political leaders are now among the best informed in the
nation about energy issues and the volatility of electricity markets.
When power bills spiked last year, outraged consumers demanded that their
representatives take steps to remedy the situation. Democrats and Republicans
alike took a crash course in the frequently arcane minutiae of the energy
business.
"We didn't create this problem. We didn't make any mistakes," said San Diego
Supervisor Dianne Jacob, who has been among the most aggressive local
politicians in responding to the energy mess and is a leading proponent of
the county's public-power plan.
"But one way or another, we're going to have to pay for it," she said. "This
was a very bad experiment."
Her solution is to establish a vast municipal utility that essentially would
take over the entire service area of San Diego Gas & Electric, which provides
power to 1.2 million customers.
PLANS FOR NEW POWER PLANTS
The county-run utility would build its own power plants and renewable- energy
resources and would transmit electricity to customers over existing San Diego
Gas & Electric lines. Funding for the municipal utility's activities is not
yet clear.
"There's no question in my mind that we can generate power for less than what
the generators are putting on the market," Jacob said.
REGIONAL APPROACH PRAISED
Medea Benjamin, a San Francisco consumer advocate, said the regional approach
sought by San Diego -- which requires a rewriting of state law -- would
benefit consumers by making construction of new plants more economically
feasible.
Municipal utility districts statewide are now limited to individual cities.
The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is one of the few large enough
to generate its own juice and sell off excess capacity.
San Francisco voters will be asked in November whether to replace the
existing San Francisco Public Utilities Commission with an independent power
and water authority.
"It would be wonderful if San Diego's disastrous experience with deregulation
results in them taking a leadership role in creation of regional public
power," Benjamin said.
Not everyone, however, backs the plan. San Diego Gas & Electric's parent,
Sempra, has actively lobbied against the public-power bill in Sacramento,
fearing that it would allow seizure of the utility's distribution system by a
county energy authority.
"It's unclear what the bill is trying to accomplish," said Art Larson, a
Sempra spokesman. "California's energy crisis isn't a local-utility problem.
It's a demand-and-supply problem."
PUBLIC OWNERSHIP CRITICIZED
Another considerable opponent of the plan is Jessie Knight, head of the San
Diego Regional Chamber of Commerce and a former member of the state Public
Utilities Commission.
He believes that public officials are no match for savvy power-industry
executives in a competitive marketplace and that the county cannot guarantee
lower rates by building its own plants.
"This thing looks like the biggest shell game in the world," Knight said.
Moreover, he said, he could not see how San Diego would win legislative
backing for regional public power when state authorities, including the
governor, were counting on revenue from all customers to back California's
multibillion-dollar bond offering.
Assemblyman Mark Wyland, R-Escondido (San Diego County), author of the
public-power bill, said it was too soon for anyone to speculate about San
Diego's breaking away from the rest of the state's power grid.
"We have to be realistic about the future of this," he said. "Right now,
SDG&E is the utility in San Diego County, and there is no intent to transform
that overnight."
Meanwhile, in case Wyland's bill is defeated, a separate legislative effort
is taking shape to expand the San Diego water authority's jurisdiction to
include electricity.

13 plans submitted to alleviate power transmission bottleneck

Washington -- More than a dozen private investors have turned in proposals to
ease a Central Valley bottleneck in California's electricity transmission
grid that can contribute to blackouts in Northern California, Energy
Secretary Spencer Abraham said yesterday.
The 13 investment plans were in response to the Bush administration's
national energy plan, which called for the expansion of Path 15, an 84-mile
stretch of interconnected transmission lines located between Los Banos
(Merced County) and Coalinga (Fresno County). The lines form the main link
for power flows between the northern and southern parts of the state.
"When we announced our plan in May to upgrade Path 15, it was dismissed as an
old idea on which little had ever been done," Abraham said in a statement.
"Today, I am pleased to announce that those days of neglect and inaction are
over."
The administration's plan calls for $230 million in new investment from local
utilities and other private entities. Abraham called it "the first concrete
step to relieve congestion on the state's power grid."
The Bush administration, he said, "is taking a leadership role in addressing
a long-neglected problem in Caifornia's electricity transmission system."
Pacific Gas and Electric Co. owns Path 15. During the late 1980s, the utility
held public hearings in the Central Valley to discuss a possible expansion,
but dropped the plans after concluding that existing transmission lines could
handle future demand.
When California's electricity shortages began to mount last year, Path 15
proved to be a major bottleneck. By preventing an increased flow of power
from the southern to the northern parts of the state, it contributed to
blackouts in Northern California. Earlier this year, the state PUC ordered an
upgrade to the transmission system.
The federal Western Area Power Administration, which manages hydropower
projects in the Central Valley, is conducting studies for the Path 15
expansion and will be holding environmental impact hearings in Coalinga on
Aug.
27 and in Los Banos on Aug. 28. More information is available on the agency's
Web site at www.WAPA.gov <http://www.WAPA.gov>.
The agency will review the proposals and make a recommendation to Abraham.
The proposals were made by, among others, PG&E Corp., Calpine Corp. and
Mirant Corp, the Western Area Power Administration said.
The expansion plans calls for a third transmission line and other upgrades
that would permit an additional 1,500 megawatts of transmission capacity,
enough to power 1.5 million homes. Construction time is estimated at three to
four years and would cost $300 million.
The companies are expected to recapture their investment by adding a
surcharge on power transmitted over the new lines, Abraham said.
The expansion is likely to follow the same route identified in the hearings a
decade ago, running in a 2,000-foot-wide corridor through the foothills west
of Interstate 5, mainly over privately owned ranchland.
In a related development, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., hailed an agreement
between the House and Senate to spend $1.3 million for the new environmental
impact report and feasibility studies to expand Path 15. The money will go to
the Western Area Power Administration.

(07-24) 07:37 PDT (AP) --
Developments in California's energy crisis:
TUESDAY:
* No power alerts Tuesday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
MONDAY:
* U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham unveils a plan to help alleviate a
transmission bottleneck that has kept power from flowing freely throughout
the state during times of peak usage. The plan calls for expanding the
state's power grid along so-called Path 15 by attracting private investment
for the $300 million project.
* A Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation has given the
full Senate a report asking for Houston-based Enron Corp. to be cited for
contempt. The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of
the Wholesale Energy Market says Enron failed to comply with a subpoena for
financial and trading documents. The Senate recessed Sunday until Aug. 20 and
could take up the matter when it returns.
* Secretary of State Bill Jones asks the state Assembly to allot $250,000 for
a legislative review into whether Gov. Gray Davis' advisers complied with
conflicts of interest laws. Jones, a Republican who plans to challenge Davis
in the next election, says the advisers failed to disclose that they held
stock in energy companies. The Senate rejected a proposal Saturday to earmark
that money for a bipartisan investigation. Steve Maviglio, Davis' spokesman,

THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's
electricity crisis.
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost
nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E,
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state
lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and
natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are
refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power
for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The
state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas
& Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and
PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs.
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's
multibillion-dollar power buys.








Figures show state lost big on extra power
Posted at 9:53 p.m. PDT Monday, July 23, 2001
BY JOHN WOOLFOLK

Mercury News


State figures show California may have lost about $14 million this month
selling surplus electricity for less than it cost.
The Mercury News disclosed last week that some power was being sold at a
loss. But the new figures provide the first indication of just how much
excess power the state bought in its desperate effort to avoid blackouts --
and how cheaply some of that power was sold when it turned out not to be
needed.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


We do not seem to be answering the questions and the format makes it pretty
difficult to understand where we are answering each question.  Is this a
style we use with FERC?  If so, fine.  But if not, here's my attempt, I have
changed quite a few answers too.
Question1: In providing an answer to our questions regarding risk assessment
or management, would you please provide an explanation to the following?  We
understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to do
business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness
evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does an
instant credit check before confirming the transaction.
However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What sort
of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizing
EOL to purchase from Enron?
Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter
party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron
utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.
All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any
transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being
conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to
all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on
the telephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In
addition, Enron,s risk management process is required to be approved by the
Enron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as
a publicly held company.  Enron,s risk policies are provided in Enron,s
publicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a
quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk
management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron
trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies.
This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the
Chairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of
transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In
addition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before they
can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group approves
a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedded
within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed through an
electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits are
not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty,s bid or offer via
EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there is no human
intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit checks
utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price
volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on
all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnline does
provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or
breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unless CRM is
sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such that
credit limit is still available.
EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters
into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on
EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General
Terms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for
each commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement
is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilateral
credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on
EnronOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to
EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between
Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements
which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online, should the
counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract (for credit or
other reasons), the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between
the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing
the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.
Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect
data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However,
does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL
collect, use or manage data regarding cookies?
It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's
mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no
capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is.
EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled.
Question 3: Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades
showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing
such data?  If yes, when?
There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction data
from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline
(http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides customers
with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they
acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online charts
for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices.
Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download the
results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also allows for
administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties to
monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with
their own systems.
Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron
will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market
activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For
example, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas
Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian
Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will
commence on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes
available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of
that day's transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in
this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.
Question 4:  In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron
Networks flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?
EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups
depending on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that
handles U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling
Australian Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back
office utilizing a &bridge8:  a process that is capable of communicating
transaction information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The
potential for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the
customer with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office
systems at Enron use transaction information as an input into various
functions, such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk
management and credit.  These back office systems are used to track
transactions from all sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other
trading systems, etc.  Information is maintained on these systems according
to accounting and regulatory rules, regardless of the source of the
transaction.
The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through
EnronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this
notifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty,
the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notified
by the system at the same time.
The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as
information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a
transaction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system
that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.
Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does,
however, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to
our settlement and credit systems.
Question 5: Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by
EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?
EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The
transactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases)
managing the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the
commodity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years
post a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is
policy across all databases.
In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free,
real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13
commodities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes
e-commerce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that
previously took place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a
proprietary, or &one-to-many8 trading platform. On a &one-to-many8 platform,
one entity, such as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a &broker8
type platform).
EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by the
second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both the
sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer
previously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six
months, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices
could have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the +bid and
offer prices8 all the time to make more informed decisions.
The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight
as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (&CFTC8) has
enforcement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for
potential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has
regulatory authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for
resale.
The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over
financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant to
the Commodity Exchange Act (&CEA8), Enron can only trade derivatives with
counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Such
transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract
Participants (&ECPs8)(generally, corporations, partnerships and other
entities that meet net worth or asset tests).
EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is a
principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a &trading facility8
as defined under the CFMA.  As a proprietary platform, EnronOnline uses
Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enron
and its customers.

In addition, Chip Cox in the Portland IT department has attempted to gain him access to the necessary applications, to no avail. It is imperative that Casey Anderson receive access to Enpower in the very near future, as he is still unable to perform necessary functions of his job after having been here three weeks.

Please let me know when I can expect these e-requests to be filled, as I have already received e-mails saying they have been granted.

Steve,
I wasn't aware I was asking for anything additional.  Will asked us to test this application and it did not work (neither the routing feature nor the confirmation).
We discussed possible solutions and tweaking of his prototype.  In addition to possible ideas to get his application going, I reminded him that this is to replace an existing workspace (excel) that has many more features (such as the insert keys, font colors, shading, etc).  If the goal was to replace our excel workspace, this would be a good start.  Since "buildroute" has been, and will be, a fundamental part of East Scheduling we agreed that the new version should save in the same manner it does now, nothing more.

We understand that EOL requires that a counter party, before accessing EOL to do business with Enron North America, must undergo a credit worthiness evaluation.   When a counter party executes or clicks on a price, EOL does an instant credit check before confirming the transaction.
However, Enron may not only buy from a counter party, it may sell.  What sort of creditworthiness standards must Enron provide to a counter party utilizing EOL to purchase from Enron?
Are there industry standard creditworthiness agreements regarding counter party credit risk that Enron uses?  If yes, may we have copies?  If Enron utilizes its own agreements, please provide us with a copy.
All counterparties are assessed by our credit department prior to any transaction being entered into by Enron whether the transaction is being conducted over the phone or through EnronOnline.  Enron, as the principal to all purchases and sales on EnronOnline and when completing transactions on the telephone or in writing, requires counterparties to be creditworthy.  In addition, Enron's risk management process is required to be approved by the Enron Board of Directors, according to Securities Exchange Act regulations as a publicly held company.  Enron's risk policies are provided in Enron's publicly available [[10-Q??]]_______ audited financial statements filed on a quarterly and annual basis with the SEC.  Enron maintains a separate risk management group that has oversight over all transactions done by all Enron trading units and that ensures compliance with the risk management policies.  This group has a separate reporting line directly to the office of the Chairman of Enron Corp. and has the authority to instruct the suspension of transactions in order to ensure that trading limits are not exceeded.  In addition, every counterparty of Enron has to clear a credit check before they can transact through EnronOnline.  The Credit Risk Management group approves a counterparty for a specific credit limit and tenor limit which are embedded within the EnronOnline database.    Every transaction is passed through an electronic credit check to assure that the credit limits and tenor limits are not violated prior to Enron accepting the counterparty's bid or offer via EnronOnline, such credit checks are done automatically and there is no human intervention.  As with all Enron transactions, the credit limit checks utilize a potential exposure calculation to take into account future price volatility.  The Credit Risk Management group monitors transaction flow on all Enron transactions including EnronOnline continually.   EnronOnline does provide CRM with electronic alerts when customers approach credit limits or breach credit limits.  No further transactions are executed unless CRM is sufficiently satisfied that the credit position has been mitigated such that credit limit is still available.
EnronOnline uses the same credit policy as other transactions Enron enters into, whether we are buying or selling.  The transactions entered into on EnronOnline are all governed by either a Master Agreement or the General Terms and Conditions (which are a shorter form of contract and differ for each commodity, these are all available on the web-site).  A Master Agreement is negotiated with the Counterparty offline and includes negotiated bilateral credit terms and these terms govern any transactions entered into on EnronOnline.  The General Terms and Conditions which will apply to EnronOnline transactions if there is no Master Agreement in place between Enron and the counterparty include industry standard credit requirements which the counterparty chooses to accept or not online, should the counterparty not want to accept to language in the contract (for credit or other reasons), the Helpdesk for EnronOnline will facilitate contact between the Enron Credit group or Enron Legal group with the counterparty allowing the Counterparty to negotiate terms which may be more appropriate to them.
Question 2:    I understood Dave Forster to state that EOL does not collect data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  However, does EOL require customers to have cookies enabled?   If yes, does EOL collect, use or manage data regarding cookies?
It is correct that Enron does not collect data regarding where a customer's mouse is moving on the system.  It is also correct to note that we have no capability of knowing where the customer's mouse is.
EnronOnline does not require customers to have cookies enabled.
Question 3:	Also, why doesn't EOL publish a "ticker" of completed trades showing prices and quantities?  Does EOL have any plans to start publishing such data?  If yes, when?
There are now several options for viewing historical pricing/transaction data from EnronOnline.  Reuters recently began showing quotes from EnronOnline (http://about.reuters.com/enrononlinequotes/), which also provides customers with the ability to reference historical prices from the date at which they acquire access.  In addition, EnronOnline provides a number of online charts for products, which graphically depict historical transaction prices.  Customers can also run reports to see their own transactions and download the results into an Excel spreadsheet on EnronOnline  The system also allows for administrative users, thereby allowing the back offices of counterparties to monitor the trading activity and deal with it appropriately in line with their own systems.
Enron does not publish transactions completed via EnronOnline however Enron will provide information on such transactions in order to ensure market activity is being correctly reflected in the approriate market indices. For example, Enron does provide EnronOnline transaction data to the Natural Gas Exchange in Calgary in order to ensure that indices produced by Canadian Enerdata accuately reflect the activity in the market place (this will commence on July 1, 2001).  At the end of each day, EnronOnline makes available to all customers through EnronOnline the weighted average price of that day's transactions.  The data associated with US Natural Gas is sent in this format to Gas Daily for inclusion in their automated exchange index.
Question 4: 	In addition, how does the data collection from EOL/Enron Networks flow to the risk management groups?  How is the information used?
EnronOnline transactions are sent to different risk management groups depending on the type of commodity transacted.  For example, the group that handles U.S. gas settlements is not the same group as the one handling Australian Power.  The transactions are transmitted to the appropriate back office utilizing a "bridge":  a process that is capable of communicating transaction information into the variety of systems that Enron operates. The potential for manual input error is thereby removed providing Enron and the customer with more efficient recording of the transaction. The back office systems at Enron use transaction information as an input into various functions, such as invoicing, preparation of financial statements, risk management and credit.  These back office systems are used to track transactions from all sources, including EnronOnline, the telephone, other trading systems, etc.  Information is maintained on these systems according to accounting and regulatory rules, regardless of the source of the transaction.
The Enron commercial employee, who is offering to buy or to sell through EnronOnline, does so through a price management software application, this notifies him immediately that a transaction is completed.  The counterparty, the Enron commercial employee and the risk management groups are all notified by the system at the same time.
The data from an EnronOnline transaction is used in exactly the same way as information is used from any transaction completed by Enron. When a transaction is completed, EnronOnline serves purely as a deal capture system that captures the data necessary to feed to our risk management system.  Enron Online does not feed settlement systems or credit systems.  It does, however, automate our deal capture system, which improves the data feeds to our settlement and credit systems.
Question 5:	Also, we assume that data regarding each trade is maintained by EOL.  If yes, in what form and for how long?
EnronOnline transactions are captured in the EnronOnline database.  The transactions are 'bridged' (duplicated) onto the various systems (databases) managing the underlying commodity (the risk system associated with the commodity).  We currently intend to store the data for a period of six years post a transaction completing (for example, deliveries finishing) and this is policy across all databases.
In general, EnronOnline is an electronic trading platform that offers free, real-time pricing information for approximately 1,800 products for 13 commodities, including electricity and natural gas.  EnronOnline utilizes e-commerce and Internet technology to conduct trading business that previously took place on the telephone and by fax.   EnronOnline is a proprietary, or "one-to-many" trading platform. On a "one-to-many" platform, one entity, such as Enron, is the principal to every trade (unlike a "broker" type platform).
EnronOnline allows buyers and sellers to act on prices that can change by the second.  Buyers or sellers can also see real-time price spreads of both the sell price and the buy price.  For example, on the telephone, a buyer previously would call to ask about gas prices for each of the next six months, but by the time the trader finished reciting the prices, some prices could have changed.  EnronOnline allows counterparties to see the 'bid and offer prices" all the time to make more informed decisions.
The energy products offered on EnronOnline are subject to federal oversight as follows:   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") has enforcement authority over physical transactions on EnronOnline to police for potential manipulation.  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has regulatory authority over physical natural gas and electricity sales for resale.
The CFTC has anti-fraud and anti-manipulation enforcement jurisdiction over financially settled derivatives (swaps and options).  Moreover, pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act ("CEA"), Enron can only trade derivatives with counterparties that qualify as sophisticated according to such rules.  Such transactions are permitted as long as both parties are Eligible Contract Participants ("ECPs")(generally, corporations, partnerships and other entities that meet net worth or asset tests).
EnronOnline is a proprietary, bilateral trading platform on which Enron is a principal to every trade.  As such, EnronOnline is not a "trading facility" as defined under the CFMA.  As a proprietary platform, EnronOnline uses Internet technology to provide another method of communication between Enron and its customers.

I understand that EOG transferred the funds yesterday, 8-13-01, for the
material for the EOG Pronghorn interconnect.  This memo is so that we are
all on the same page.

Re:  Building - I called Abbott Building Company yesterday and told them
that Enron is releasing the building to EOG.  I talked with Mike Abbott
about when they could deliver the building and he said, "We can deliver it
in the morning if you want."  So, I gave him the phone numbers for Dirk
Ellyson to get directions and further instructions.

Re:  Equipment for inside the building - I talked with Don Pitts yesterday,
as well as, Mel Mayes and Ernie De Los Santos.  I told Don we could deliver
the material to his office or to the site and he said they really weren't
ready for it quite yet.  Mel Mayes, who will be doing the wiring and
electrical work for EOGResources, agreed that he didn't want to have to work
around all the equipment laying in the building.  So, Ernie, of the CDC
group in Roswell, has agreed to deliver the equipment to the site when EOG
is ready for it, which should be sometime next week.

Jeff:
Just a heads up, I am meeting with Gary Pfeiffer, CFO in a couple of weeks to brief him on discussions we have been having with a team of DuPont managers about a deal that looks a bit like the Lilly deal, DuPont's outsourcing of its Corporate campus, including a number of lab buildings in Wilmington.

As you remember, we met with Pfeiffer and a few others here on 50 to discuss their risk mgmt strategies around gas....those discussions went nowhere, but we are now back and actively engaged with personnel in his group on this outsource opportunity.

Doubt he would call, but  I wanted you in the loop.

Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the Chief Judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that "you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink."  Below is a Cliff Notes version of the Judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 PM today.  Attached is the complete work.

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- "While the amount of such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum.  At the same time, while there are vast sums due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California.  Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller?  The Chief Judge thinks not."  Another notable quote:  "it is the opinion of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated."

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which was summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected.

Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recommendations do not go beyond that date.  "Spot market" sales are "sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery."

Evidentiary Hearing- "The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-type, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot markets in an after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event, sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period."

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period October 2, 2000 through May 28, 2001.

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (associated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price.  "In the event that the marginal unit is located in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate and Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  The daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in Financial Times Energy's "Gas Daily" publication for the aforementioned delivery points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and holidays)."

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the calculated market clearing price.

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation.

Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June 19th Order.

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergency requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated.

Offsets-  "Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all charges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period."

Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


For those of you who might be interested, William Simon, a  Republican
candidate for governor in California, spoke to the Sacramento Press  Club at
a lunch I attended today. Simon is the son of the late William E.  Simon,
the former Treasury Secretary.

During his presentation, he made a few comments abou the  energy situation
inCA:

A former U.S. attorney and Rudy Guiliani protege, it bothers  him that Gov.
Davis has made a point of prejudging generators and marketers  before
investigations are complete (Simon supports full investigations into
generator/marketer practices). He also called Bill Lockyer's "Spike" quote
inappropriate, and said it violates the canon of ethics to threaten
prosecution.

He believes it is a mistake to buy the transmission lines and  that the focus
should be on increasing supply. The rhetoric coming from  the governor and
AG "do nothing but chill investment," and said he doesn't blame  Mirant for
its hesitation to build new plants.

If the current energy situation were in his lap, he would  approachit by
getting everybody to the tableto try to find an  overall solution. It's
being done piecemeal now, he said, and that's not  effective.

He sees three elements toaddressing the  problem:
1. Limit state involvement -- he does not support a  public power authority;
2. Get supply online;
3."Restructure,"which he related to taking a  sagging company and figuring
out a concerted approachto fixing its  problems rather thanputting out fire
after fire.

He believes the generators should relieve some of the  debt.

He was asked ifan Edison bankruptcywould be a bad  thing.He said
it"can't be good," but prefers tothink  ofEdison's status as a
consideration to the overall approach but not  necessarily as the ultimate
goal. He indicated that bankruptcy is not  favorable but should not
necessarily be avoided at any  cost.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the Chief Judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that "you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink."  Below is a Cliff Notes version of the Judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 PM today.  Attached is the complete work.

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- "While the amount of such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum.  At the same time, while there are vast sums due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California.  Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller?  The Chief Judge thinks not."  Another notable quote:  "it is the opinion of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated."

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which was summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected.

Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recommendations do not go beyond that date.  "Spot market" sales are "sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery."

Evidentiary Hearing- "The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-type, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot markets in an after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event, sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period."

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period October 2, 2000 through May 28, 2001.

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (associated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price.  "In the event that the marginal unit is located in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate and Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  The daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in Financial Times Energy's "Gas Daily" publication for the aforementioned delivery points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and holidays)."

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the calculated market clearing price.

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation.

Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June 19th Order.

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergency requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated.

Offsets-  "Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all charges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period."

Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

My time at Enron is quickly coming to an end as this is my last week. I have enjoyed working with each of you and getting to know you over the years!

I hope to keep in contact with many of you as I transition to a new phase in life...parenthood (advice welcomed)! For those of you who did not know, we are expecting our baby to arrive on October 17th. I plan to have a couple of months to prepare for this new adventure. Although I am sure that Baby Monk will take after his/her mother and love to travel, we decided that the commute from Dallas to Houston might be too much for him/her in the early years. It is with regret that I leave this great company. My current plan is to enjoy some time off and to begin looking for a position based in Dallas in the first quarter of 2002 (suggestions and referrals appreciated).

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Earlier today, the Senate Energy Committee held the first of two days of hearings on Chairman Bingaman's "white paper" on electricity and the electricity provisions of other pending bills.  The hearings will continue tomorrow with all of the five FERC commissioners as witnesses plus private sector witnesses.

Today's hearing went well from our perpective, with support for Super RTOs and general support for expanding the grid both physically and from an access view point voiced by Senators and witnesses.  Sen. Craig Thomas even said four RTOs were too many -- there should be one national RTO to run a national grid.  Today's witnesses represented the Dept. of Energy, EPSA, EEI, NRECA, APPA, IBEW union, Alliance to Save Energy, ELCON, NERC, NARUC, NASUCA and the State of New Mexico.  We will provide a more detailed analysis after completing a review of the lengthy written testimony, but a summary of the DOE testimony and the first panel of private sector witnesses follows.

1.	DOE said they are working on electricity legislative language.  Should be done soon.  Chairman Bingaman said they needed to get it done in time for the Committee to consider it when the Committee takes up electricity as early as the second week in September.  Deputy Sec. Blake implied that their proposal was or would soon be shared with other Administration agencies for review.

2.	In response to questions, Blake said that legislative action on jurisdiction questions (fed v. state) would be "useful" but he stressed that they view any new legislation as clarifying that FERC has authority they feel already exists.  He said that while states have an important role to play, Congress must recongize the interstate character of the market and the need for open access to the interstate grid.  (In response to a question, Blake later said that FERC had largely addressed the access issue or would do so.)

3.	On reliability, he was given a chance to say that DOE supports th NERC "consensus" language, but instead repeated that the Administration favors "enforceable reliability standards" but wants to work with the Committee on the exact language.  I took this as confirmation of what we have heard informally from DOE in terms of key players there not being enamored of the NERC "consensus" approach, at least as it exists in its old, long form.

4.	Sens. Craig and Cantwell pushed Blake on why the Administration has not fully supported BPA's request for a debt limit increase to finance expansion of the BPA grid.  Blake said they support the BPA expansion projects, but that OMB feels BPA has enough borrowing authority through 2003.  This did not sit well with Craig and Cantwell.  I spoke with Sen. Craig in the hall, following up on a conversation I had with him the other evening about BPA, and he stressed that he is committed to getting BPA the debt limit it needs.  As you know, commercial has asked us to help BPA given matters pending between Enron and BPA.

5.	On the first private sector panel, even John Rowe, the Co-CEO of Exelon and past EEI chairman (testifying for his company and EEI), said several times that there should be strong RTOs that each cover a wide idea.  He said his board voted yesterday to sell its transmission assets IF a strong, independent operator could be found.  Rowe also said that RTOs should be "encouraged" (implying not mandatory?).  The APPA witness was strong on RTOs, saying that all entities will be part of RTOs even without legislation.  NRECA said that co-ops would oppose federal jurisdiction over them and that they favor voluntary RTOs.  EPSA made the usual case for competition, open access, RTOs, etc.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Sue Mara and I joined representatives of ABAG, New West, New Energy, Green
Mountain Energy and Commonwealth in a series of meetings with Commissioners
and advisors on the two orders set for Thursday, June 28 on PX credits and
direct access.

Republican Commissioners Bilas and Duque are very unhappy and cynical about
their chances of reversing the order suspending direct access.  They do feel
that the discussion about the PX credits and the limitation of recovery of
the credits to billing credits can be bifurcated and postponed to another
decision at a later date.  Procedural issues have arisen related to giving
public notice of any amendments, but all the offices gave some indication
that the delay in considering this issue was a 90% + possibility.

On direct access itself, Brown, the swing vote, repeatedly asked us to help
him by getting the legislature to pass a direct access bill.   He will vote
for the suspension unless the legislature acts or the administration
(Davis/Angelides) changes its mind.  The same message came from the other
offices.  Notwithstanding the ongoing global settlement discussions, I
recommend that we work with all the ESPs and the direct access coalition to
try to get a separate D/A bill passed immediately.  All of the other ESPs
are trying to reach Burton, Bowen, Angelides (the Treasurer) and Davis, in
that order, to try to get something to break loose.

What is the status of discussions in Sacramento?  We made a strong pitch for
the Commission to grant a delay in the vote on Thursday, and one is
possible, especially if we have lots of direct access supporters asking for
more time at the Commission and in Sacramento.  They all understand that the
bonds will not be issued in the next three weeks.  Our window of time in
which to act is likely to be the end of July, if the Treasurer and the Gov
try to rush the issuance of the bonds.

Can we convene a conference call to coordinate any remaining options for a
quick rifle shot bill on direct access?

Let's talk tomorrow.

Mike Day

Here's the scoop as I know it as of 3;15 today.

2002 Commercial Plan mtg for McCarty, Thursday, August 16th
As of 8/14 @ 2:40, Danny advised that the meeting will proceed BUT, suggested that they break at 10:00 and attend the Enron All -Employee meeting and reconvene at 11:00 - 1:00. Note the lunch will be delivered at 11:30.
Tracy & John, can you arrange the Agenda accordingly and reminder that Eric Gadd will be leaving at 12:00 so his area should be covered before then.  Can we achieve the business goals with the break?  Is this ambitious?
If you want to extend the meeting time, I have extended the conference room (49C2) till 1:30.  The conference room is booked at 2:00 by Steve Harris/Drew Fossum but, I could ask them to adjust their meeting if more time is needed. Please advise.

Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan, Wednesday, August 22nd
CANCELED as per Tracy on 8/13

NNG/TW Actuals alias CBR meeting, Friday, September 14th at 1:30
A request from Deb/Dave's office to reschedule as Dave had conflict and can not attend. I followed up with Cindy on July 26th & 27th and Cindy suggested that Danny talk to Stan.  I reminded Danny to discuss with Stan at the July 30th staff meeting.  No discussion or resolution.
Note that a CBR update was completed on July 11th and as per Tracy, the information would be fairly current to update Stan.  A NB Strategy meeting was also completed on July 19th in Omaha.
8/14, as per Tracy, Stan referred back to Danny.  Danny suggested canceling and thought we had already done so.  I advised him that the Quarter Forecast Review w/ Stan was canceled but, not this particular meeting. CANCEL??

3rd CE Review w/ Stan, Tuesday, September 18th
Confirmed on Danny's calendar

I am really only available Monday am (I am on a well-deserved vacation next

up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.
What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA,
particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES
still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov
Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state
commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both
Sue and Jeff on this.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Here is the latest......
Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker last night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison bailout plan tomorrow.
Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses. Since it is not expected to be any hearing on any bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August 20th - we look  for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 15th deadline.

Paul and Jeff,
Becky, Donna and I (gas girls) met with Phillip Allen (ENA West) to discuss
FERC gas issues today, and Phillip had some issues that were more state than
federal, and I told him I would bring them to your attention.
He is interested in seeing incentive rates or more hedging on the part of the
CA LDC's so that all their needs are not being served by the spot market.  In
the current market, hedges (longer term contracting and financial) are being
done primarily by the producers and marketers, which results in a thin and
probably off-kilter market (the LDCs buying for the customers are not
participating).  I know we have to square this with the EES positions, but I
am not up to speed on what is going on in CA on this issue.
Phillip also made that point that while the LDCs are focusing on their core
load, no one is doing system planning on the macro basis, taking into account
the ability of the physical systems to meet the needs of all customers, core
and non-core and making sure the system will be adequate.
Finally, he is very interested in seeing the CA LDC rates unbundled.
Any updates we can provide to Phillip (and the gas girls) would be
appreciated, as well as what our plans are to address these issues.
From our side, El Paso is having a conference in July and we will be taking
up a number of allocation and transportation issues at that time.
Thanks.

Hello all,

Considering the circumstances if we don't move up, I think we should
just
move
up to the first division. As a lover of european soccer, I enjoy the
promotion/relegation system. It is a great way for leagues to equalize
competition. So we should just take it in the gut and toughin' up and
move
to
the 1st. It'll be fun and competitive. Maybe it'll give us more
motivation
to
stay focused as a team. I'm all for it. Afterall, we deserve it. We
earned
this
move. I don't want to switch and loose the Green Room name just to
stay in
2nd
Div.

But this does mean that it wouldn't hurt to have a few more good
players
join
us. So if you know of anyone really good, have him join.

Jon--The check's in the mail.

To the first!

Jay

Edison makes deal to pay generators of renewable power
Getting turned on over a turn-off
By Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 14, 2001)
Political action doesn't get much easier than this: Pull a plug. Flip a
switch.
If you dislike utilities, like the environment or know anyone who does you
might already have received an e-mail call to "Roll Your Own Blackout" for
three hours next week on the day of the summer solstice.
Flocks of anonymous e-mails have been swooping across the Internet for weeks
promoting the hand-rolled, voluntary blackout aimed at fostering
conservation.
It is a phenomenon that points out just how deeply energy issues have wormed
into the national consciousness, as well as how much the Internet has become
the world's water cooler and its bulletin board.
The messages urge people everywhere to turn out their lights and unplug what
they can from 7 to 10 p.m. Thursday, creating a dip in energy use that would
roll across time zones -- part protest and part party.
"Talk to your kids. Watch the stars come out. Cuddle. Pretend the TV's
broken. Think what can happen when tens of thousands join this peaceful
protest against price-gouging and environmental irresponsibility," exhorts a
Web page devoted to the idea.
Marilyn Nyborg of Grass Valley says she's thinking about flipping a circuit
breaker to cut off all power to her house Thursday night, but at the very
least her lights and television will be off.
"It's beautiful outside now. It's nice to sit on the porch. As it gets darker
I don't mind using a flashlight to read and spend some time with my partner
and our new kitties," she said.
Nyborg, 62, a high-tech recruiter who calls herself a "quiet activist," said
she'll be taking part to demonstrate that people can come together to
conserve.
"I take great offense at (President) Bush's comment that it's our right as
Americans to waste fuel. I don't think it is. We're also stewards of the
planet," she said.
David Aragon, a Berkeley engineer who says he coined the phrase "Roll Your
Own Blackout" online for a similar protest, said the idea had its roots in
politics but is nonpartisan.
He said he just learned this week that Los Angeles artist Monica Rex was the
one who expanded his notion, scheduled it for the first day of summer and
sent it out into the world.
Rex said she e-mailed a few paragraphs to about 50 friends in mid-April and
posted them on a handful of Web sites to make people aware that they have the
power over how energy is used.
She thought so little of it at the time that she didn't keep a copy.
"I didn't know it would get anywhere, actually," she said. But it took off.
By mid-May, multiple copies were landing in e-mail boxes of nearly everyone
with environmental or energy interests. An organic farming public relations
firm publicized it further, saying "millions" of people had been alerted.
Newspapers from Seattle to Denver began writing about the anonymous
upswelling. Web pages sprang up dedicated to it.
"Everyone I know has seen it. This has swept the globe," said Jeff Softley, a
West Hollywood bartender and longtime environmentalist who has tried for more
than a decade to promote the idea of an "Energy Fast" on Earth Day.
Softley, who knows a little about stirring up community action, was so struck
by how quickly the message moved that he speculated a big environmental group
was probably behind it, trying to appear grass-roots.
"I just think it caught people's imagination," said Rex. "I am just amazed at
how things move around the Internet." She theorizes that her name was
stripped off early in the forwarding process, making it appear anonymous when
she had no particular interest in either hiding from the idea or in promoting
it.
It really doesn't take much to bring a single idea to millions of people,
said David Goff, a University of Southern Mississippi professor who co-edited
the book "Understanding the Web."
"When you get it in the hands of like-minded people, it doesn't take long for
that multiplier effect to operate, and it will go very far very fast," he
said.
E-mail- and Web-driven protests have triggered fuel boycotts in Great Britain
and Internet boycotts in France, Goff said, and "we're in the early stages of
this."
The whimsical blackout message -- circulated in several versions -- calls on
people turn off what they can, then "light a candle to the sun god, kiss and
tell, make love, tell ghost stories, do something instead of watching
television, have fun in the dark."
Many versions say the voluntary blackout -- "a simple protest and a symbolic
act" -- is being held to protest Bush's disdain for conservation, energy
efficiency and alternative fuels.
Some variants direct people to books on alternative energy and energy
efficiency. Some say the candle should burn for the sun goddess. Some add a
gentle caution, to unplug only what can be "safely" dispensed with.
Michael Straus of Point Reyes said he plans to take part by having a
candlelight dinner with his parents. Straus, whose "Beyond Organic" PR firm
helped tout the idea, said he put the message out over a public interest and
academic news wire after it kept landing in his mailbox.
The message has zinged from state to state and reportedly reached Europe and
Asia. It has hit e-mail lists devoted to everything from feminism to
used-book sellers. A Texas newspaper credited it to a river protection group
called American Rivers, something the flattered but bemused organization
denied.
Millions of people would have to be involved for their efforts to show up on
the computers of the California Independent System Operator in Folsom, which
constantly monitors electricity use to match demand with supply.
If 10 million households turned off a single 100 watt light bulb at once, 100
megawatts would drop off the state's electric grid -- probably not noticeable
amid 30,000 or so megawatts of early evening demand, said Jim Detmers, an ISO
vice president.
But 200 to 300 megawatts of reduced demand might be detectable under the
right conditions, if sudden changes in wind or temperatures or cloud cover
don't obscure the effect, he said.
Computer engineer Aragon said he has no idea how many people will turn off
and tune out June 21.
"That's almost like speculating on the spot price of electricity," he said.
"I wouldn't touch it."

New pacts could ease blackouts: Edison crafts five-year deals to help relieve
the fiscal burden on its alternative energy suppliers.
By Jim Sanders
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 14, 2001)
In a move that could help ease blackouts this summer, Southern California
Edison has negotiated five-year deals designed to relieve the financial
burden on its alternative energy suppliers.
Gov. Gray Davis hailed the pacts, which state officials helped negotiate, as
an important step toward stabilizing the energy market and ending litigation
over about $1.3 billion owed by Edison.
The move also could help taxpayers, cutting up to $100 million off the
state's energy tab this year by reducing the amount of power needed from the
expensive spot market, officials said.
The agreements apply specifically to Edison's suppliers, however, and do not
resolve similar disputes involving Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
The pacts also add a new twist to an ongoing dispute over Davis' bid to save
Edison from bankruptcy by buying its transmission lines for $2.76 billion and
providing other financial incentives.
Davis warned at a press conference Wednesday that rates promised in the pacts
are tied to legislative approval of the rescue plan.
"I believe, given the changed circumstances, that legislators will take a
different look at the (plan)," he said. "I'm not saying it's a certainty, but
I'm saying there's now renewed interest."
Senate President John Burton ridiculed the governor's assertion and made it
clear he won't be pressured.
"There are an awful lot of questions here, and I think it ill behooves the
governor, who has not always moved with alacrity, to say that the Legislature
is dragging its hands on this issue," Burton said.
Legislators currently are crafting one or more alternatives to the governor's
rescue plan, which they say has little support in the Assembly or Senate.
Southern California Edison, a massive private utility, declined comment
Wednesday on the QF -- "qualified facilities" -- agreements or the governor's
rescue plan.
California taxpayers have spent billions of dollars since January buying
power on behalf of Edison and another financially strapped private utility,
PG&E.
One major problem for Edison has been the $1.3 billion debt owed to firms
that generate alternative energy from wind, geothermal, solar, biomass and
gas-fired cogeneration facilities.
As debts rose each week, some QFs were forced to quit producing electricity,
thus exacerbating the energy crisis and forcing California to buy more power
on the spot market.
Statewide, most of the alternative energy providers, though still financially
strapped, have resumed production.
The new Edison pacts would add 100 to 300 megawatts of new electricity by
enticing suppliers to exceed existing contracts.
They would provide a mechanism for repaying Edison's debts to the alternative
energy firms. They also promise separate rates for electricity from renewable
sources and gas-fired facilities.
Key parts of the deal include:
Rates for electricity produced by gas-fired plants would vary based on the
cost of natural gas at the California-Arizona border.
Edison would pay 5.37 cents per kilowatt-hour, plus a capacity charge, for
energy produced by wind, solar and other renewable energy sources.
The firm would pay an estimated 4 to 9 cents per kilowatt-hour, depending on
natural gas costs, for electricity produced by gas-fired plants.
The pacts give Edison and the owners of gas-fired cogeneration facilities the
ability to renegotiate if market conditions change dramatically.
"The initial reaction from a number of (firms) has been favorable," said
Steven Kelly of Independent Energy Producers, an association of wholesalers.
"We're hopeful this can be implemented in PG&E territory, too," said Joe
Ronan, an official of the Calpine energy firm and chairman of Independent
Energy Producers.

Lockyer to seek grand jury probe of power players
By Dan Smith
Bee Deputy Capitol Bureau Chief
(Published June 14, 2001)
Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday that he will ask the Sacramento
County grand jury to look into potential criminal actions by power generators
and natural gas companies that have led to skyrocketing wholesale power
prices.
Lockyer said he has reached no conclusions about possible criminal acts by "a
dozen or so" companies his office is investigating, but is hopeful grand jury
testimony will assist in the probe.
"I just want to make sure that we thoroughly investigate every possibility,"
Lockyer said. "Some people conclude that we don't have evidence. That's not
what I'm saying either. I'm saying we're in the middle of evaluating the
evidence."
Lockyer will take the investigation to the grand jury after July 1, when 19
jurors convene for the new fiscal year. He would not predict how long the
process would last.
He said many of the 80 lawyers in his office assigned to the energy crisis
are looking at possible civil violations relating to market manipulation and
other allegations against power players.
Possible criminal violations involve the state's racketeering, unfair
business practices, fraud and antitrust statutes, Lockyer said.
Power companies have consistently denied allegations that they have violated
any civil or criminal statutes.
Besides Lockyer's probe, several legislative committees are investigating
power interests' actions in California's energy crisis.

Energy Digest: PUC: Edison must pay some QF debts
(Published June 14, 2001)
Southern California Edison should pay at least 15 percent of its back debts
to any alternative power producer, called a "qualifying facility," that needs
the money to get back into operation this summer, utility regulators agreed
Wednesday.
The 5-0 decision by the state Public Utilities Commission also endorsed
agreements reached Tuesday between Edison and some key qualifying facilities
that call for incentive payments for increased production and a price of $54
a megawatt-hour for five years for some producers.
Ensuring that every power plant is up and running at maximum levels this
summer will be critical to keeping prices low and blackouts rare,
commissioners said. However, several added that they supported the revised
contracts reluctantly because of long-term costs.
"California consumers have overpaid billions of dollars to QFs" already, said
Commissioner Carl Wood. He warned that as more new plants are built, "we may
not need this power, and yet we will be obligated to purchase it at prices
that are vastly higher than other power that will be available."

New members rock FERC
WASHINGTON -- The arrival of two new members is showing signs of shaking up
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, a once-obscure agency that may be
the best hope for controlling wholesale electricity prices in power-starved
California.
Patrick Wood III, former chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission, and
Nora Mead Brownell, a former member of the Pennsylvania Public Utility
Commission, will participate in their first meeting Monday when the panel
meets in an unusual session on California rates.
Among those most heartened to see the new members was William Massey, a
Democrat and frequent dissenter on the five-member panel who strongly favors
price controls to head off what he has described as a looming economic
catastrophe for the state this summer.
"I never thought I would be so thrilled to see two Republicans coming over
the horizon," Massey said.
Massey's enthusiasm is shared by many California Democrats who believe Wood
and Brownell will tilt the balance toward stronger action in their crusade
for lower wholesale rates.

New price restrictions for electricity said to be coming
By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
WASHINGTON ) Under growing political pressure, federal regulators are
preparing new but still limited price restrictions for electricity in
California and other Western states, according to government officials.
Congressional and private industry sources said the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission is almost certain, at a meeting next week, to expand a price
mitigation directive to cover all transactions in California and expand it to
other states, including the Pacific Northwest.
The limited price caps, announced in April, now apply only to California and
only to periods when a supply emergency is in effect because power reserves
have fallen below 7.5 percent. California Gov. Gray Davis has called them
inadequate and full of loopholes for power generators to skirt controls.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told a Senate hearing "it now appears" that
the April order will be broadened. She said it was "another step forward" but
far short of the cost-based price caps she and other congressional Democrats
have sought.
Several other sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said they
expected the FERC to broaden the April order.
The commission chairman, Curtis Hebert, said price mitigation issues will be
discussed at its Monday meeting.
The five-member commission of three Republicans and two Democrats has come
under attack from Democrats in Congress and from Davis. They contend the
agency has been far too timid in curtailing price gouging in the wholesale
Western power markets.
The commission regulates wholesale electricity markets and interstate natural
gas pipelines. Under a 1934 law, it is required to ensure prices are just and
reasonable.
Hebert, a Republican named as chairman by President Bush in January, defended
the agency at an energy forum Wednesday.
"Our price mitigation plan is working," said Hebert, citing recent declines
in electricity and natural gas prices in California and elsewhere in the
West. Acknowledging the criticism, he said of the FERC: "We're not the most
popular people in town right now."
This week, electricity prices on the spot market in California fell to below
$100 a megawatt-hour for the first time this year. Natural gas prices also
eased. Earlier year price have frequently surpassed $300 a megawatt hour, ten
times what they were in pre-crisis 1999.
A megawatt is enough electricity to serve about 600 homes.
California officials have said it is too early to tell how the FERC's April
order has affected prices.
The reason for the price drops is unclear, Feinstein said. She noted that
California's attorney general this week announced plans for a grand jury to
consider criminal charges against some power generators and marketers.
Also Wednesday, several economists told a Senate hearing that temporary price
controls, if structured properly, should not impede electricity investments
and supplies as Republican lawmakers and the administration repeatedly have
argued.
"It is incorrect that regulation necessarily interferes with supplies,"
Cornell economist Alfred Kahn, a prominent deregulation advocate, told the
Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
It was the Senate's first hearing on California's energy crisis since
Democrats recently took power.
Kahn said that if price caps were temporary, exempted new power plants, and
provided sufficient profits, "there will be no shortage of people interested
and willing to build new power plants."
"The greatest danger is continued chaos," said Paul Joskow, an economist at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He, too, urged some price controls
based on costs of production.
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., said the economists were painting " a rosy
picture." He read letters from several Wall Street analysts who insisted that
price controls would be a "recipe for disaster" and make investors reluctant
to enter the California power market.
Senate Democrats have promised to move forward with legislation to require
the FERC to act unless the commission takes additional steps to address
allegations of price gouging in California.
"If we ignore these problems, we put our economy at risk," said Sen. Joseph
Lieberman, D-Conn.

Governor plans to release details on state's power purchases
By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) California signed long-term electricity contracts at prices
higher than those now available on the daily spot market, Gov. Gray Davis
acknowledged Wednesday as a judge ordered him to release the pacts' details.
But Davis said the long-term contracts between the state and power generators
helped break the price spiral that had driven electricity prices to record
heights.
Critics said other factors played a larger role in what they warned is a
temporary price drop, and said Davis foolishly locked in long-term rates at
the market's peak.
"The price, the spot market on electricity is coming down because we've
locked in long-term contracts," Davis said. "This is Economics 101. ... We
were paying a lot more in January and February than we are now on the spot
market because we have dramatically shrunk the spot market, providing
reliable power for California at affordable rates."
By next month, the state will have to buy less than half the power it needs
on the daily market, making the generators compete for a smaller share of the
market and forcing prices down, he said.
Davis said that will stabilize a wildly fluctuating market for the long term,
although the cost may exceed market costs in years to come.
The contracts, along with new plants, more conservation, criminal and
regulatory investigations into price gouging and possible price caps have
combined to cut costs, Davis said.
Saying "there will be a day of accounting" for price gougers, Davis also said
a "pincer effort from Sacramento and Washington" forced energy producers to
lower prices.
Davis appeared Wednesday as a San Diego superior court judge ordered the
state to release the contract details by noon Friday.
Several news organizations and Republican Assemblyman Tony Strickland,
R-Thousand Oaks, sued Davis, saying the contracts used state money and should
be open to the public.
For months, Davis had refused to do so, saying that would hurt the state's
negotiating position. Earlier this week, however, he asked San Diego Superior
Court Judge Linda B. Quinn to lift the confidentiality clauses in the 38
contracts, because the secrecy was no longer that important.
The contracts, worth almost $43 billion, could keep long-term rates
relatively high for years if the recent decline in prices remains in place.
Contract records obtained by the Los Angeles Times showed the state is
committed to buying power at prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour during peak
demand periods and more than $95 for power at times when demand is low.
By comparison, the state recently bought peak power for less than $100 an
hour and less than $20 an hour at night when demand is less.
Wholesale prices have dropped recently, but they could rise this summer when
temperatures and air conditioning use climb.
Energy analysts agreed with Davis that a convergence of factors led to lower
prices, not just the long-term contracts.
Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California Energy
Institute, called the prices in the state's contracts "disturbingly high"
compared to those available a few years ago, but the state didn't have much
choice.
In essence, Borenstein said, the contracts mean California now pays its high
power bill "on an installment plan" in which generators agree to string out
their profits over years instead of recouping them now.
But Peter Navarro, an economist at the University of California, Irvine, said
the Davis administration negotiated "from a position of severe weakness. They
(generators) had us over a barrel and they stuck it to us."
Davis, Navarro said, "adopted a long-term strategy to fight a short-term
crisis."
The administration will look particularly foolish if the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission acts next week to rein in higher power prices after
months of refusing to intervene, Navarro said.
"This is a huge mistake that's been made by the state and what's being shown
here is the depth of it," said Assemblyman David Cogdill, R-Modesto, who
supported Strickland's suit.
"In effect, we locked in an energy crisis for the next 10 years," said Harvey
Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. He called for
Attorney General Bill Lockyer to toss out any contracts he determines
overcharge the state.
Davis energy adviser S. David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power, said the contracts altered the marketplace and
freed the state from its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market.
"The war ain't over," Freeman said, "but we have landed on enemy territory
and we are rolling them back."
Draft of blackout plan offers forecasts instead of warnings
By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) In May, Gov. Gray Davis announced a plan to give Californians
detailed warnings of rolling blackouts to help businesses and residents plan
for outages.
But a draft of the plan, obtained by The Associated Press, has changed the
proposed one-hour "blackout warning" to a "probability forecast," which one
utility official called a "vague warning that's wrong more often than it's
right."
The one-hour notice is expected to be wrong two-thirds of the time, because
the Independent System Operator will continue to look for power to keep the
lights on, said several people who participated in meetings to plan the
blackout notifications.
Under Davis' plan, the ISO, manager of the state's power grid, will also
issue a 48-hour rolling blackout forecast and the 24-hour location
notification.
Peter Navarro, an economist with University of California, Irvine who works
on energy issues, called the one-hour blackout notice "a very blunt
instrument."
"It's going to be like the typical California forecast ) sunny, hot and dry
with a chance of rolling blackouts," Navarro said. "How do you prepare for
that?"
The Governor's Office of Emergency Services coordinated the plan to implement
Davis' order by consulting private and municipal utilities, the ISO and the
Public Utilities Commission. The plan will be presented to Davis by Friday.
Even after the issuing the 60-minute blackout notice, the state will keep
looking for last-minute power, said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. "The
public knows the ISO doesn't have a crystal ball, but it can provide
information to help them make critical decisions."
A utility official, who participated in the calls and who spoke on the
condition of anonymity, said the one-hour blackout probability forecast
"doesn't come anywhere close to what's been promised to the public.
"Instead of a real one-hour notice of an outage that people can rely on and
make plans for, they're just going to get another vague warning that's going
to be wrong far more often than it's right," the executive said.
The utilities will make the biggest differences in handling blackouts, said
Steve Conroy, a spokesman for Southern California Edison, which participated
in one of the conference calls.
"There is more advance notice from the utilities to our customers," Conroy
said.
Edison and San Diego Gas and Electric Co. have joined Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. in assigning customers a "block number" so they will know what
neighborhood are next to be hit by a blackout.
"The newest element that's required is to make geographic information
available to the public. It was already available to public safety offices,"
said John Nelson, spokesman for PG&E.
Blackout forecasts, Conroy said, are "very much like a weather forecast" and
subject to change. McCorkle said forecasts will also encourage power
conservation and further lessen the chance of blackouts.
Eric Lamoureux, an emergency services spokesman, said the plan isn't intended
to predict a blackout but give a sense of when they're likely.
Utility customers don't need a guarantee, just a warning that blackouts could
occur, said Michael Shames, executive director of Utility Consumers' Action
Network.
"The objective here is to allow customers to prepare for the eventuality of
blackouts," he said. "The people will not rebel if the lights stay on. What
we do need is more than 30 minutes notice."
Jennifer Ng, the owner of Moonlight Cleaners in Elk Grove, said she'd welcome
two days' notice for blackout. It took her more than a week to catch up on
work that a couple hours of blackouts halted at the dry cleaners, she said.
"It affects businesses more than people think," Ng said. "If I had more
warning, I would be able to stay late the night before or bring in more
people."
To really give a true blackout warning, Shames said, the ISO must "draw the
line" and stop shopping for electricity to keep the lights on.
Plus, Shames added, repeated false alarms could lose their effectiveness.
"That's why they shouldn't be issued cavalierly."
Shames and Navarro have called for a price ceiling for last-minute power buys
and a willingness to suffer blackouts in prices don't come down. The
Legislature is now considering a bill to allow state power buyers to stop
shopping for power.
California governor to release details of state's power purchases
By Alexa Haussler
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Gov. Gray Davis is close to releasing details of 38 long-term
contracts between the state and power generators, a move that would end a
lengthy battle over whether the agreements should remain confidential.
Davis for months had refused to release information on the contracts, but his
aides said Tuesday the disclosure was expected this week.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that confidential government records
show state officials agreed to contracts at prices higher than those now
being paid in the daily spot market.
The contracts, which total nearly $43 billion, could burden consumers with
relatively high utility rates if the recent trend toward lower electricity
and natural gas prices continues.
Records obtained by the Times show the state is committed to buying power at
prices up to $154 a megawatt-hour during peak demand periods and more than
$95 for power at times when demand is low. In comparison, the state recently
purchased peak power for less than $100 an hour and less than $20 an hour at
night when demand dropped.
The recent purchases reflect a drop in wholesale prices, which could rise
again this summer when temperatures climb and air conditioning use surges.
"The theme here is the governor embarked on a long-term strategy for a
short-term crisis," Peter Navarro, an economist at University of California
Irvine, told the Times. "They pretty much got this exactly wrong."
State officials defended the long-term contracts, crediting the agreements
with altering the marketplace. The contracts also have freed the state from
its nearly total reliance on the volatile spot market.
"This was all a well thought-through plan of action," said Davis energy
adviser S. David Freeman, former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water
and Power. "The war ain't over. But we have landed on enemy territory and we
are rolling them back."
Republican lawmakers and several news organizations, including The Associated
Press, sued Davis in March, saying his refusal to release the contracts'
details violated the California Public Records Act.
Still, Davis refused, saying that revealing the details would put the state
at a competitive disadvantage in other contract talks.
Oklahoma-based Williams Energy, one of the generators with a state contract,
opposes the release of the contract details.
"Information contained in those is proprietary information that allows us to
be competitive and to bid competitively," said spokeswoman Paula
Hall-Collins.
Raymond Hart, Department of Water Resources deputy director, wrote power
generators Monday saying the department would ask a judge Wednesday to throw
out a confidentiality provision in the contracts.
Meanwhile, the Times also reported Wednesday that executives and board
directors from power companies gained millions of dollars through stock sales
last year.
State officials accuse them of profiteering from the energy crisis, but some
executives netted upwards of $123 million in option transactions in 2000,
according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stock
prices for energy companies enjoyed robust growth last year.
Report: Energy executives selling stock for millions
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
LOS ANGELES ) Executives and board directors from power companies that state
officials accuse of profiteering from the energy crisis have gained millions
of dollars through stock sales, according to a newspaper report.
The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that these executives exercised
options and sold stock for double, triple and even 10 times the level of
prior years. The newspaper based its findings on trading data supplied by
First Call/Thomson Financial and federal regulatory findings.
Kenneth L. Lay, chairman of Enron, netted $123 million in option transactions
in 2000, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The amount was triple his 1999 level and nearly 10 times what he made in
1998.
Lay also has made stock sales since November that have been worth nearly $23
million.
Lay and other power company executives have shown a knack for timing their
stock sales near the top of the market. Many of the companies' shares have
fallen since the bulk of the stock sales, the Times reported.
Critics claim corporate profits for the power companies have been driven up
by the energy crisis in California and the West. The crisis created a bull
market for publicly traded power companies, making the shares held by the
executives particularly lucrative.
State officials were outraged, but not surprised by the transactions.
"It is part of a pattern of smart trading by these guys," said state Sen.
Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, who chairs the Senate Energy, Utilities and
Communications Committee. "The mentality is to get everything that you can
and then ride out the bust.
"I think they are figuring that by this time next year the party will be over
and they will be left sitting in a room with plastic cups half-filled with
stale beer," Bowen added.
The stock sales seemed logical to Loretta Lynch, president of the California
Public Utilities Commission.
"It stands to reason that if the companies are making exorbitant profits,
then the individuals who run the companies are also making exorbitant
profits," she said.
The power executives who sold stock dealt shares of the following companies:
Virginia-based AES Corp.; Duke Energy Corp. of North Carolina, the
Houston-based energy firms of Enron Corp. and El Paso Corp. and San
Jose-based Calpine Corp.
Jeffrey K. Skilling, CEO of Enron, filed regulatory documents in May
announcing his intention to sell 140,000 shares of Enron stock for $7.98
million. Skilling in 2000 netted more than $62 million in similar
transactions.
Harvey Padewer, president of Duke Energy's Energy Services division, sold
Duke stock for $12.26 million in February, netting $2.99 million.
State and federal agencies are investigating several large energy companies
to determine if they conspired to boost prices either by limiting the
construction of power plants or by manipulating the supply of natural gas
needed to run power plants.
No one is claiming the stock trades were illegal, but critics have linked the
transactions to the profits gained in California.
"The generators have no shame," said Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov.
Gray Davis. "It speaks to how there has been a massive transfer of wealth
from California and the West to Texas and the Southeast."
Lay and Enron officials declined to comment on stock trading by executives
and a spokesman for AES also declined to comment on the matter.
A spokesman for Duke Energy said many of the sellers at Duke continue to hold
large amounts of the company's stock and sold the their stock to capitalize
on a healthy market.
"Many of these people have a lot of stock, and this 7/16is 3/8 an opportunity
to diversify their personal portfolios at an opportune time when Duke's stock
is up," said Terry Francisco, a spokesman for Duke Energy.

HUNTINGTON BEACH ) An energy company says a restriction prohibiting it from
selling power generated at its California plants out-of-state violates
interstate commerce laws.
AES Corp. filed a petition Monday with the California Energy Commission
claiming the restriction should be withdrawn because it hinders the company's
efforts to negotiate a contract with the state Department of Water Resources,
which brokers power deals for the state.
AES spokesman Aaron Thomas said Tuesday that the two sides are close to an
agreement and filing the petition was a backup if negotiations fail.
The Arlington, Va.-based company recently won approval from the state's
Energy Commission to restart two idle generators in Huntington Beach, but
were told it could only sell the 450 megawatts produced at the Orange County
plant to California utilities.
The 40-year-old units, which will reopen in August, will generate 10 percent
of the 5,000 megawatts needed by the state to avoid rolling blackouts this
summer.
Customers of SDG&E may not get back $300 million
Money might be part of state deal to buy electric grid
By Jeff McDonald
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 14, 2001
Talks to allow state ownership of the poles and wires that push electricity
across San Diego County have dragged on in numbing detail for months.
But with the deal between Gov. Gray Davis and Sempra Energy "extremely
close," local politicians and a consumer advocate fear its price will include
hundreds of millions of dollars that had been headed for ratepayers' pockets.
San Diego city and county officials took the unusual step yesterday of
criticizing regulators and the parent company of SDG&E for excluding them
from secret negotiations.
State must bare secret energy deals
FERC appears set to expand its price curbs
Davis announces deal to boost summer power supply
Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis
Mayor Dick Murphy, meanwhile, dispatched a letter to the president of the
California Public Utilities Commission pleading to be invited to the table.
"I need your assurance that the city will be permitted to actively
participate in the formation of any proposed settlement," the San Diego mayor
wrote. "The ratepayers of San Diego city and county deserve no less."
At stake: more than $300 million paid to SDG&E by its 1.2 million customers
over recent months.
Utility company executives claim the cash should go to shareholders, while
local elected officials, consumer advocates and even state regulators say the
money belongs to customers.
The disputed windfall accumulated over several months, as SDG&E used
long-term contracts to buy power at one price then sell the electricity to
consumers at a much higher rate.
Customers were billed the larger of the two costs, a practice SDG&E parent
Sempra Energy said was appropriate even though SDG&E has insisted for months
that under deregulation it merely distributes power.
"Shareholders deserve to make money on contracts that they took the risk
for," said company spokesman Ed Van Herik, who was unable to specify how much
electricity is bought and sold under the agreements.
SDG&E may still be benefiting from the long-term deals it reached with
Louisville Gas and Electricand Pacificorp.
The agreements ran between 1997 and the end of this year, according to San
Diego City Attorney Casey Gwinn. Because of the litigation, he was allowed to
review the contracts but is not permitted to disclose their value.
"There is a fundamental fairness principle that is at issue here," Gwinn
said.
Earlier this year, state regulators ruled that the value of the contracts
should help pay down a so-called balancing account -- some $750 million SDG&E
says it spent on power but hasn't been allowed to collect from customers.
Utility company lawyers appealed that ruling and the case remains locked in
litigation.
But in an apparent policy reversal, the PUC last week joined Sempra in asking
the appeals court to delay considering the claim while the governor's office
deals for the network of SDG&E power poles and transmission lines. Gwinn's
office was served notice of that filing Tuesday.
The value of the long-term contracts has become a critical issue in those
executive-level discussions, which San Diego area politicians say is unfair.
"It's a slap in the face," county Supervisor Dianne Jacob said. "They charged
us more and now they're making a big profit."
Michael Shames of the Utility Consumers' Action Network said a closed-door
deal between Davis and Sempra could undermine the PUC ruling that the SDG&E
contracts are ratepayer assets.
"The PUC will never hear it, the city of San Diego and UCAN will never get a
chance to argue it" in court, he said.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said the governor is carefully weighing the
plight of San Diego consumers as he pushes ahead with negotiations to buy the
SDG&E electric grid.
"We're extremely close to an agreement with the utility, and first and
foremost in the governor's mind are the interests of San Diego ratepayers,"
he said. "The deal is going to be a balanced business transaction."
Acquiring the poles and wires that move power across the state is a key piece
of the governor's plan to resolve the electricity crisis in California. Davis
struck a deal with Southern California Edison, but Pacific Gas and Electric
declared bankruptcy in April, so those assets are in dispute.
Even though transmission lines make money for the three investor-owned
utilities, critics worry that buying the electric grid may not be wise
because the system is old and in need of more than $1 billion in upgrades.
PUC attorney Gary Cohen said he sympathizes with the San Diego County elected
officials who first brought the complaint over the SDG&E contracts to his
office. But ending the power struggle in California is more important.
"If there's a deal, those contracts are just one part of it," Cohen said. "I
understand their frustration. The contracts are up on appeal and they won.
But in fairness, everybody needs to wait and see what the whole resolution
will be."
Discussions include not only talk of a price for SDG&E transmission lines --
likely around $1 billion, according to Shames -- but also whether the utility
adequately hedged its power purchases against rising costs and the
reasonableness of other buying practices.
"There's a bunch of issues on the table," Cohen said. "It's difficult and
conceivably impossible to settle cases where you have a whole bunch of
parties if everybody is insisting they're part of the negotiations."
State Sen. Dede Alpert, whose September legislation established the
"balancing account" now in dispute, said she doesn't care who receives public
accolades for steering the value of the SDG&E contracts to ratepayers.
"I certainly expect this needs to be something that benefits the people of
San Diego," the Coronado Democrat said. "But whether the credit goes to the
city of San Diego, the PUC or the governor I don't think matters."
Vallejo City Council votes to switch work hours to save power
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 13, 2001
VALLEJO ) In an effort to save an estimated $11,000 in electricity costs,
City Council members unanimously voted to switch city hall workers to a
four-day workweek.
The 7-0 vote came Tuesday as a result of the city's increased energy bills.
Since the Association of Bay Area Governments suspended its electricity
purchasing program, which allowed participants to buy power cheaper than
other cities, Vallejo has seen an increase from 9.5 cents a kilowatt hour to
20 cents per kilowatt hour.
The switch to 10-hour days begins July 9 and will continue through Nov. 9.
City Hall will be open 7:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday. The
current hours are 8:30 a.m. to 5:15 p.m. Monday through Friday.
Police and fire departments will be unaffected by the change.
City officials also recently negotiated with O'Hara Energy Corp. to install
special meters to monitor and control energy use at City Hall. That program
is expected to save $50,000.
Davis announces deal to boost summer power supply
By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 14, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis, claiming momentum toward solving the
electricity crisis, announced an agreement yesterday to keep unpaid small
generators on line this summer.
Davis said a pincers movement from Washington, D.C., and Sacramento is
telling energy price-gougers that "the days of figuratively raping and
pillaging California are over and there will be an accounting."
Attorney General Bill Lockyer announced that a criminal grand jury will begin
meeting in Sacramento early next month to investigate whether the state's
electricity and natural gas markets were manipulated and whether illegal
profits were made.
Davis also said he was optimistic about getting legislative approval of some
variation of his long-stalled plan to keep Southern California Edison out of
bankruptcy.
"I'm not saying it's a certainty," Davis said. "But I am saying there is now
a renewed interest in ratifying something like the memorandum of
understanding that we have worked out with Edison."
Davis said the Legislature can change the proposal, but the amendments must
be acceptable to him and to Edison. The Senate is planning to begin hearings
on the Edison plan in a few weeks.
The governor said pressure on electricity suppliers is coming from
investigations, long-term contracts that have lowered spot market prices and
increased energy conservation by Californians.
Davis said pressure in Washington is coming from congressional hearings and
the possibility that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will order
regional price limits or refunds for overcharges in California.
The governor also said three new power plants could begin operating in the
next 30 days, an apparent reference to Calpine's 500-megawatt plant near Yuba
City and its 559-megawatt plant at Pittsburg and a 320-megawatt Mission
Energy-Texaco plant in Kern County.
The small non-utility generators that operate as "qualifying facilities"
under a federal program are capable of providing about a quarter of the power
needed by the state.
In March, blackouts during two days were said to have resulted, in part, from
small generators who were not operating because they had not been paid. Davis
announced an agreement yesterday between Edison and its QF contractors.
The Davis administration thinks the agreement could produce an additional 100
to 300 megawatts of power (a megawatt is enough for 750 to 1,000 homes) this
summer because some generators had previously contracted to sell less power
than they are capable of producing.
Richard Katz, a former assemblyman from Van Nuys asked by Davis to negotiate
the agreement, said the QF contractors will receive an average of about 11
cents per kilowatt-hour during the five-year contracts.
Katz said generators who use renewable energy sources -- such as solar, wind,
geothermal, and biomass -- will be paid an average of about 7.37 cents per
kilowatt-hour.
He said that co-generators, who use natural gas and sell the excess heat to
businesses, will receive an average of 15 cents to 16 cents per
kilowatt-hour.
The generators will receive 10 percent of the money they are owed when the
contracts are signed, and the full debt eventually will be paid with
interest.
Katz said the new rates for the small contractors are tied to legislative
approval of the Edison rescue plan. But Senate President Pro Tempore John
Burton, D-San Francisco, disagreed, saying action by the Public Utilities
Commission yesterday implemented the agreement between Edison and the small
contractors.
FERC appears set to expand its price curbs
By Joe Cantlupe
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 14, 2001
WASHINGTON -- Facing mounting political pressure, the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission seems poised next week to greatly expand existing
energy price restrictions that now kick in only during emergencies.
Hints of the move surfaced yesterday as a Senate committee started
investigating FERC's response to the California power crisis.
The current order limits prices only when the state's power reserves dip
below 7.5 percent, the level at which a Stage 1 alert is called.
Critics, including Gov. Gray Davis, say that order is full of loopholes
because any price can be charged when no emergency has been declared, which
is most of the time.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., told the Governmental Affairs Committee
yesterday that "it now appears that on Monday, FERC may extend this order to
the entire Western energy market and may ensure that the order stays in place
at all times."
"This sounds good on the face of it, and it may well be," added Feinstein.
"However, this situation is ripe for manipulation, as I believe they have
been doing," she said of power generators in the state.
She said that FERC is essentially considering a "flexible price cap" that,
like the existing order, sets the price on the cost of producing electricity
at the most-costly, least-efficient power plant.
FERC officials declined to discuss the agency's possible action next week, or
Feinstein's remarks.
FERC's previous "price mitigation" order went into effect May 29 and some
federal regulators say it caused wholesale electricity prices to plummet in
California. Megawatts that once cost an average of more than $300 -- and
sometimes several thousand dollars -- recently dropped to below $100 during
peak usage. A megawatt powers about 750 homes.
But some observers say that many factors are responsible for the sudden price
drop, including cooler weather, conservation and state long-term electricity
contracts.
At a meeting of the California Public Utilities Commission in San Francisco
yesterday, Chairwoman Loretta Lynch said she is "very encouraged" that FERC
is reconsidering its earlier decision, but said the result would be
"absolutely inadequate" because FERC would cap prices at a relatively high
rate, according to The Associated Press.
Yesterday's Washington hearing by the Governmental Affairs Committee was the
Democratic-controlled Senate's first foray into California's emotionally
charged power crisis and seemed a harbinger of intensified partisan wrangling
to come.
Feinstein and Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., used the hearing to make pleas
for immediate action on price caps and to complain about FERC.
"Today, we see no semblance of really meaningful regulation," Feinstein said.
Committee Chairman Joseph Lieberman agreed.
"The fact of the matter is that the California market is not even
functional," said Lieberman, D-Conn. "I think it's fair to say if the federal
government doesn't step in and provide temporary price relief, the natural
trend toward deregulation will come to a halt."
California officials have sought price caps to rein in what they term
outrageous electricity costs charged by out-of-state companies.
But the Bush administration has vehemently opposed caps, saying they would
discourage investment in new power plants.
In recent weeks, however, some key congressional Republicans have softened
their position, saying they would not oppose limited controls.
FERC itself -- heavily criticized by Davis and others as a do-nothing agency
-- appears to be showing a new face, with two new members appointed by Bush
promising more aggressive monitoring of the power industry.
Feinstein and Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Los Angeles, have sponsored bills that
would enact tougher price caps. The legislation is expected to be debated
later this month.
Sen. Fred Thompson, R-Tenn., the ranking Republican on the committee, opposed
Boxer and Feinstein's calls for price caps and said that California officials
were partly to blame for the state's problems for acting "too late."
State must bare secret energy deals
Judge orders release of pacts with suppliers
By Karen Kucher and Craig D. Rose
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITERS
June 14, 2001
The state's secret energy deals won't be secret much longer.
Even as some details about California's long-term power contracts began to
emerge, a Superior Court judge yesterday ordered the almost-full release of
the state's agreements with power suppliers by noon tomorrow to attorneys
representing news organizations and a dozen state lawmakers.
Judge Linda B. Quinn also set a hearing for June 27 to decide whether to
order the state to release information about its costly spot-market
electricity purchases, something the state only wants to do six months after
the transactions are completed.
The news organizations and legislators filed suit under the Public Records
Act, seeking the contracts that bind the state to more than $40 billion in
power purchases over the next decade.
Revelations that California has contracted to pay as much as $154 per
megawatt-hour to Constellation Energy Group Inc. quickly brought complaints
that the state had overpaid for electricity. The price of the commodity is
now plunging.
The Los Angeles Times and at least one other newspaper, which obtained some
of the long-term state contracts, reported that power costs ranged to as low
as $58, and down to about $22 when the state supplies fuel to generating
plants.
By comparison, spot prices yesterday for power were from $55 to $65 per
megawatt-hour, far below levels earlier this year when prices averaged more
than $250 for several months and reached a high of nearly $3,900.
Until last June, prices rarely exceeded $50 per megawatt-hour. Deregulation
advocates said prices would decline as the market was opened up.
Gov. Gray Davis' strategy in dealing with budget-busting costs over the past
year has been to sign long-term deals to avoid buying in daily markets.
Yesterday, he said comparing contracted electricity costs to spot prices is
unfair.
"The price of spot market electricity is coming down because we have locked
in long-term contracts," Davis said. "We knew this going in. The purpose of
getting long-term contracts is to wean ourselves away from a spot market."
The governor referred to the often-cited criticism that California's soaring
power prices were caused partly by an excessive dependence on buying power in
daily markets, as opposed to under longer contracts.
Severin Borenstein, an expert in electrical deregulation from the University
of California Energy Institute, agreed that comparing current spot prices
with contract prices was unfair.
Speaking at a news conference yesterday hosted by the governor's press
secretary, Borenstein said the deals should be analyzed in the context of
conditions that existed as they were negotiated.
Spot prices during the first three months of this year, for example, averaged
about $285 per megawatt hour.
But a prominent critic of deregulation said that neither buying strategy
presented an acceptable option for consumers.
"They gouge you with spot prices or they gouge with term contracts," said
Harvey Rosenfield, president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer
Rights in Santa Monica, which is expected to lead a ballot initiative next
year over deregulation.
"We have to get out of this deregulation disaster."
Parts censored
For months, Davis refused to make public details about the contracts, saying
that revealing information about the deals would put the state at a
disadvantage in contract negotiations.
The state became a major electricity buyer after the near-bankrupt utility
companies were unable to make purchases on their own.
This week, however, Davis agreed to release the contracts, with certain
portions censored. The governor's change of heart came as the newspaper
reports emerged and critics alleged that the state was overpaying.
A spokesman for Enron Corp. said yesterday that the state had many
opportunities to secure power at lower prices than it appears to have paid
under the contracts. Enron, however, declined to sell any power to the state
under contract.
Outside of court yesterday, Deputy Attorney General Tim Muscat said that the
state has secured enough contracts in the past month to feel comfortable
releasing long-term contract details.
The state has signed 61 contracts or agreements in principle that cover much
of the state's unmet electricity needs, he said.
"We have finally reached critical mass and now we think we can disclose the
contracts and still protect the public's interest in getting the best deal
and going forward with negotiating agreements," Muscat said.
But he added that the state wants to keep private some technical contract
information that could harm the state's contract partners.
Media opposed
"You are going to be looking at a contract that has 98 to 99 percent of the
content in it," Muscat told reporters gathered outside Quinn's San Diego
courtroom. "The only thing that could be removed are some technical issues."
Alonzo Wickers, an attorney representing the coalition of media
organizations, said he will oppose allowing the state to omit portions of the
contracts and will seek full information about spot market buys.
Wicker said that having complete access to the documents "is essential to the
public's full understanding of the contracts."
Wickers is representing the Copley Press, which publishes The San Diego
Union-Tribune; the Los Angeles Times; the San Jose Mercury News; the San
Francisco Chronicle; Dow Jones; the McClatchy newspapers; The Orange County
Register; Bloomberg, and The Associated Press.
Muscat had unsuccessfully sought 14 days to provide the documents to
plaintiffs. He said the state's business partners needed to have the
opportunity to raise objections to releasing the information. The contracts
contain confidentiality clauses.
Among those seeking a delay in the judge's ruling yesterday was an attorney
representing Morgan Stanley, a marketer in power transactions, who said he
had just learned of the litigation this week.
"Once the contracts are publicly disclosed, the eggs cannot be unscrambled,"
said attorney Eric Landau, who said his client's competitive position could
be hurt by the release of information.

NEWS ANALYSIS
Senate Democrats to Use Power to Illuminate Bush Energy Plan
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Political Writer
WASHINGTON--It was a sign of things to come when Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) bounded into the chairman's seat Wednesday to convene a
hearing on electricity price controls in the Senate Governmental Affairs
Committee.
With their sudden ascension into the Senate majority, Democrats have
regained control of one of Congress' most effective weapons: the power to
summon witnesses to investigative hearings, backed by the authority to
subpoena documents. And that could signal a major shift in the debate on a
broad range of issues--energy policy foremost among them.
Though the Democrats lack a coordinated strategy, several committees
plan hearings through the summer and fall that will shine a sustained
spotlight on Bush administration energy policy decisions, and the role of
energy companies in rising gasoline and electricity prices. Through these
hearings, the Democrats hope to reshape the climate of public opinion around
the energy debate, pressure both federal regulatory agencies and private
companies to change their behavior--and score some political points by
painting President Bush's policies as a boon to the energy industry.
"What this allows us to do is continue some of the unpleasant
conversations that Bush is trying to avoid and that Bush could avoid in the
more controlled atmosphere when Republicans held the Senate," said one
Democratic strategist.
That prospect presents obvious problems for Bush, who already is
battling the perception in opinion polls that he favors producers over
consumers in the energy debate. But these inquiries also carry dangers for
Democrats, who spent six years charging that congressional Republicans
misused their investigative authority through repeated hearings into alleged
ethical misdeeds by the Clinton administration.
"The public doesn't want to see a party that's out for blood. If they go
down that path, the public will turn off just like it turned off on the
Republicans," said John Podesta, President Clinton's White House chief of
staff. "But what these investigations and oversight hearings can do is really
help tell a story about whose side this White House is on . . . and what the
impact is on real people's lives."
Senate Republicans wasted no time denouncing the hearings as a waste of
time. "Let me tell you what the name of the game is now: It's pure politics,"
said Sen. Frank H. Murkowski (R-Alaska), who chaired the Energy and Natural
Resources panel until the Democratic takeover.
Asked about Wednesday's proceedings, he replied: "Is that going to
produce any more energy?"
Conscious of both the opportunities and risks, Democrats are moving
cautiously to exercise their new clout. Lieberman has not issued any
subpoenas in his investigation into California's power crisis, and his first
hearing Wednesday was a sedate affair that broke no new ground.
Still, the authority to investigate has always been one of Congress'
most potent tools, particularly when Capitol Hill and the White House are
held by different parties.
Over the last century, congressional hearings have largely divided into
three categories. One tradition centers on allegations of ethical wrongdoing
in the executive branch--such as the probes that unearthed the Teapot Dome
oil scandal during Warren G. Harding's presidency, vetted the Watergate
burglary that led to President Nixon's downfall or examined the Whitewater
land deal and campaign fund-raising during Clinton's presidency.
Hearings also have been used to look for misbehavior in the private
sector, usually as an attempt to lay the groundwork for reform legislation,
such as the Depression-era hearings on the stock market crash that led to the
creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
And, finally, legislators have used the hearing forum as a competitor to
the president's bully pulpit--as a means to draw attention to ideas the White
House opposes. Probably the most successful example of that occurred in the
1960s, when nationally televised hearings by Sen. William Fulbright (D-Ark.)
on Vietnam crystallized opposition to the war.
During Clinton's presidency, Republicans emphasized ethics
investigations. So far, in the energy debate, Democrats are focusing on the
second and third categories.
"Hearings of the sort Lieberman is conducting aren't designed to disrupt
[like the hearings during the Clinton administration]; they are designed to
force new issues in the debate," said Johns Hopkins University political
scientist Benjamin Ginsberg, who has written extensively on the process. "As
long as the energy debate was conducted only inside the Republican Party, it
was a debate between proponents of free markets and proponents of freer
markets."
At Wednesday's hearing, Lieberman summoned half a dozen economists to
make the case for the price caps on electricity rates that California Gov.
Gray Davis supports and Bush adamantly opposes. Next Wednesday, Lieberman
will convene a second hearing that will give Davis a national forum to make
his case for price controls--th

The IPPNY/SSK communications effort for NY is finally a go!  Since I will be
on a train from Philly to NYC tomorrow during the Leadership call the
following is a quick summary of what's going on in NY.

IPPNY/EPSA
Gavin Donohue, Mark Stultz and myself met Tuesday for lunch and discussed
each organizations' communications efforts and the need for coordination
given the overlap in membership, the dual focus on NYC, and the costs
involved.

The EPSA effort is a "reassurance" campaign for states who have already begun
deregulation but who might be nervous to proceed after witnessing the CA
debacle.
EPSA is working with the Chamber of Commerce and is focused on four markets
(Boston, NYC, Baltimore and DC).
EPSA contracted with a PR firm out of Austin, TX and they have already
developed 3 broadcast advertising spots (Mark is on the steering committee
and should have access to the spots)
EPSA shared the spots with SSK and IPPNY yesterday (which SSK didn't like
very much)
The ads would run on PBS and cable - the media buys have not been purchased
yet.
Apparently EPSA developed the ads and are running them past focus groups as
we speak
Interestingly enough, the spot which they developed for the eastern states
used the word deregulation over and over (a word that is not popular here).
AND when tested among the opinion elites - they didn't know who PJM was!!
Lastly, the accompanying print ad isn't that impressive.
Mark will have access  to the ads and - as a steering committee member - will
have the opportunity to weigh in on the ad and decide whether to move to the
second phase of funding.
The good news is that EPSA has agreed to not interfere with what IPPNY is
doing in NY and will work with us as our efforts evolve.

IPPNY/SSK
During our meeting on Tuesday, we finalized the initial press release, and
agreed on the inserts for the press kit.  Apparently, Hillary Clinton and
other members of the NY delegation are holding an energy roundtable on
Monday.  IPPNY's press release will go out over the wires Monday around 11:00
am and will hopefully get dual coverage from reporters who are covering
Hillary's event.  I'll forward to you the final release but it generally says
that IPPNY is unveiling its Energy Solutions Program - a five point action
plan to address the long and short term energy needs of NY (designed to avoid
a CA-style energy crisis).  The plan includes energy conservation (which was
on the top of new yorkers minds in the statewide poll), accelerated siting
process, creation of an efficient, multi-state energy marketplace, upgrading
the state's power transmission system and encouraging utilities to enter into
contracts that protect consumers from volatile energy prices.

Gavin will be back in NYC on July 10th for media training and SSK is in the
process of lining him up for meetings with press outlets and other
organizations.

We're also planning to schedule him at various events around the state which
deal with energy issues.

We hope to host some sort of energy roundtable of our own at the IPPNY fall
meeting in October.

As for advertising, we don't have the funds or the commitment today but after
we launch this effort we're going to pull the participating companies
together to have a discussion about advertising and to guage whether they
want to support it with additional funds.

I'll get you final copies of the release and press kit as soon as they are
put together.

To date, Enron is in for 50K in NY but it's been an expensive three months of
research, and prep time and materials so managing the budget is going to be
an issue throughout the summer.

I will be in PJM all day Thursday to cover PJM's initial meeting for the
development of their communications office and get a rundown of their plans
for "messaging"

Swerzbin submitted comments on Monday;  feedback will be given to him today - some met some not;  Mike's comments on our feedback due on Monday;  should be in a position to execute next week.
Heizenrader is good on numbers and still talking language.  Final issues relate to language about breaking laws or regulations and all of the accusations that are out there about Enron and it's employees breaking laws and regulations.  Michele Cash has talked to Sanders and Haedicke about this stuff.  Tim H., Michele, Amy Fitzpatrick (HR Generalist in PDX) and I met today.  We think that we have arrived at language that will work for everyone.  Ball is in Michele's court to turn another draft around to us.
Belden - I am good on the numbers.  I have have concerns about indemnity against California and West Power related lawsuits.  I also want to formalize the arrangement that I have with Haedicke with respect to Enron covering my legal fees associated with the west power investigations.  Michele is going to take a cut at some language.  She also needs to convince me that I am covered by the Directors and Officers indemnifications which are part of Enron's bylaws and Delaware law.
Richter - he's been lame about giving me his comments.  I've been lame about riding him on it.  I will do that today.
Wolfe - Greg currently is considering offers from Calpine, AEP, and Enron.  AEP is offering significantly more money.  Greg needs to decide where he wants to work and who he wants to work with.  There is a very real chance that we lose him.  However, we've shown his a great bid, so we will just have to get by if he leaves for a lot of money.  When I say a lot, he is talking about guaranteed 600k per year, roughly.
Motley - has declined our offer.  The total numbers looked good, but he doesn't like Enron options.  If we took his Option value and put it into cash or restricted stock he would be done.  I mentioned it to John and he didn't want to do that.  On the one hand, if that will get him done I think that it's a great outcome.  On the other, we showed him some good numbers and I respect the fact that John wants to keep things consistent.  Tough call.  He did mention that if Enron's Treasury department would let him gamma trade his options withodd lots and no margin requirement that he would take the options.  He has a legitimate point that he has no way of assuring that he can achieve the value of the options.  It's also very hard to argue with an options trader on this point.

FERC chairman to resign
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Curtis Hebert, a target of congressional Democrats and California's governor over his handling of the Western power crisis, is resigning at the end of the month as chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
White House spokeswoman Ann Womack said Monday that Hebert submitted his resignation in a letter to President Bush delivered to the White House on Friday. The resignation takes effect Aug. 31.
The resignation had been expected amid indications for months from the White House that the president wanted Patrick Wood III, a state regulator from Texas, to head the federal agency that oversees wholesale electricity markets and interstate natural gas transportation.
``The president appreciates Curtis Hebert's service as chairman of the FERC. He has worked hard to balance the need for just and reasonable rates with the need to encourage adequate new supplies of energy,'' Womack said.
Bush is expected to appoint Wood, an old associate from when Bush was Texas governor, as the commission's new chairman. Bush nominated Wood, who had been chairman of the Texas Public Utility Commission since 1995, to the FERC earlier this year. The Senate confirmed him May 25.
Hebert, a Republican from Mississippi and close friend of Senate Republican leader Trent Lott, was named FERC chairman by Bush in January. At the time, Hebert was the only Republican on the five-member commission because of two vacancies.
Although Hebert was said to have considered the appointment as a permanent one, word quickly emerged from the administration that the president wanted Wood, with whom he had worked in Texas, to head the agency that has been at the center of the California electricity controversy.
Hebert, a strong free-market advocate, has defended electricity deregulation and vigorously opposed FERC's imposing price controls in California even as his critics said the Western electricity markets were out of control and not working.
He frequently clashed with one of the commission's Democratic members, William Massey, over FERC's role in assuring that just and reasonable prices are charged by Western power marketers. Massey wanted some additional price restrictions.
California Gov. Gray Davis and the state's two senators -- Democrats Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer -- have blamed Hebert for FERC's failure to move aggressively in curtailing power prices in the West and its refusal to demand tens of billions of dollars in refunds of high prices charged California for power.
Hebert argued that price controls will add to the power supply problem in California by stifling power plant construction. He also insisted that FERC has been aggressive in seeking refunds when evidence of price gouging has been found.
In June, after Wood and another Bush nominee, Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, joined the commission, FERC issued price caps on electricity in California and other Western states.
Since then, electricity prices have eased in the California market. While the lower prices have been largely attributed to a combination of mild weather and a push for conservation, the FERC-imposed price restrictions also are widely believed to have played a role.

I called him at home last night.  His absence from the office this week was somewhat unplanned.  He is at home with his kids as his mother inlaw is taking a break for the week (remember, he has four kids, including a two-month old baby and his son Erik who has had a variety of health problems).  He is planning on coming in at the end of the week to interview some internal people for a job on the services desk.  I agree that it looks like he is out of here, but he gave me no indication.  I think that we should sit tight for a few days.  I will know when he's coming in to do the services interviews.  Perhaps Amy should have a conversation with him at that time.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


On June 27, 2001 we met with David Parquet, a Vice President with Enron
North America, in the offices of Enron Corp located at 101 California St.,
San Francisco. in order to learn whether there might be confidential Enron
Corp or Enron Wholesale Services documents responsive to the "Dunn"
subpoenas (or threatened AG subpoenas) within that office.  Based on this
interview we conclude there likely are such documents. This is the summary
of our discussion:
*	David told us he  works for Enron North America through its
Wholesale Services business. Personnel from four or five Enron entities work
out of the San Francisco office. These entities are:  Enron North America
(Parquet and his team, which deal with construction and siting of energy
facilities), Mike McDonald (another Enron VP and his team, which deals more
with Wholesale Services); Enron Corp (through Regulatory Affairs personnel
which include Sue Mara, Jeff Dasovich and Mary Shane); EES,  and Enron
Broadband Services (one person).
*	David  is responsible for power plant development in the west for
Enron North America.  This includes the siting, development, permitting,
etc. for projects in Las Vegas, Washington State and all over California.
David also was on the board of  ISO.
*	Mike McDonald deals with long term wholesale contracts. David
thought he and his team would  have documents relating to forward positions
and contracts. David described several deals he thought  they had done in
conjunction with Enron Wholesale personnel located in Portland. There are
three to four analysts in the office who would also have similar
information.
*	David thought several persons in the  San Francisco office had
access to pricing curves. He thought it likely that pricing information in
Houston was often accessed by some San Francisco personnel and probably
preserved on hard drives.  He also identified "hot sheets" which list
current deals and "how much money is made"; general corporate mailings; ISO
books and David's notes on ISO board meetings.  Included in these documents
may be information on sales to DWR by either Enron Wholesale or EES which
may potentially include pricing information.
*	As far as David knows, all personnel in the San Francisco office use
e-mail from Lotus Notes servers which may be administered through a server
in Houston.  However, there is a separate San Francisco server. All e-mail
is routed through this server and it may store e-mail and data received from
Houston.
*	David and others in the office know about the investigation by
Dunn's committee. I told him we had been told by the AG's office that they
were about to serve Enron Corp with a subpoena for documents, but so far we
had not learned they had done so. He asked for guidance about what he and
others in his office should do with respect to existing documents and
e-mails on their hard drives.  I asked him to preserve what he had on his
hard drive for now and told him one of us would get back to him within the
couple days to discuss this further.

Attached is the document that will serve as the basis for our discussion
tomorrow.

The document summarizes key business principles, our understanding of the
business principle agreement for each point, and our interpretation of the
current version of the contract for each point.

There are several other points that I did not include in this document as
we feel they are contractual negotiation points versus deal principle
points.

Our goal is to gain clarity on these high level points tomorrow, to get
these back to Brian for contract redlining and turnaround by Saturday, and
then to reconvene for a detailed contract review session on Monday.

Also, as we would like to focus on these key principles, we are planning to
have myself, Kenny, and Mark present for the meeting.  Brian will be on
call in case we need him.

Thanks and we look forward to our visit tomorrow at 1 p.m.

TJ,

Let me let you in on a little secret my man -- you ain't gettin' no break
from the Luke man when 2 pops out, nor are you getting a break from Luke
and/or Daniel Jr. when no 3 is born. There are no breaks to be had in the
parenting arena for about 20 years.

Point 2 -- It pains me so to make this statement, but Stamas might actually
be able to beat me in basketball now since I have no cartilage in my left
knee. The Dr. says that my running days are over (which was obviously a
serious blow to my lifestyle), but more importantly, he said that my
organized hoop days are history too. This is not to say that I can't
contribute the next time that we conduct a demonstration of our skills while
hung over at the Charlotte "Y", but it ain't looking good for me ever
swatting Stamas' ugly jumper into that pretty boy face of his ever again.
Then again, I'm crippled, not dead. Certainly elevation is not required to
stuff him so ... maybe I will.

Go Sooners!

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem.   Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low, John Bryson, CEO of SoCal, with the support of the Governor, are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates - Richard Alarcon (D-San Fernando Valley), Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles).  Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position.  However, at minimum, Bryson, Governor Davis and/or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout.
Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access.  The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Senator Burton spoke with the Speaker  Wednesday  night and urged him not to convene an Assembly session during the scheduled recess, since the Senate is not going to interrupt their vacation. Burton's request, in conjunction with the Speaker's trouble in getting enough of his members to return on their own dime (he didn't want the Assembly to pay for people to fly back from European vacations for 48 hours - and few members were willing to pay for it themselves), means there will probably not be a hearing on Hertzberg's Edison bailout plan tomorrow.
Since Hertzberg plan is different from the bill the Senate passed, Burton wants Hertzberg to include the Senate in discussions on a solution that can get passed in both houses. Since  there is not expected to be any hearing on any bills/Edison bailout before both houses return from the summer recess on August 20th - we look  for negotiations to occur on extending the MOU's Aug 15th deadline.


State of the Negotiations-- Issues to Be Covered

Below are the current provisions Keeley and Hertzberg are wanting to pass into legislation (when they return from recess).  Currently, they are not sure if all of these amendments would be wrapped up into one bill or if they would just amend bill SB78XX while introducing a new bill SB_XX.  Working under the assumption that they would amend bill 78XX and introduce a new one, the following issues are a reflection of their current positions.  If they decide to introduce one new bill than the issues below would be included into one piece of legislation.  Please remember, these issues are only their current thoughts and are such to change.  There are important differences in the proposals with significant implications for a SoCal voluntary filing--these include whether to include a bond bailout; conservation easement; a rate-payer benefit account; neither bill offers a transmission line purchase or any kind of trust to assist SoCal.

SoCal Debt
SB _XX
No provision for debt.
SB 78XX (amended)
Approximately $2.9B through corporate bond financing supported by a Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) over a period of time sufficient to pay the bonds (10-15 years).  Final debt amount to be established by the PUC and the State Auditor.

Core vs. Non-Core
SB _XX
For purposes of paying the SoCal debt, creates a Core program for consumers with a peak demand of less than ?Kw and Non-Core customers of ?Kw or more.  They would share in the cost of SoCal debt retirement: (1) all consumers share pro rata for the first two years, (2) Non-Core pay 100% after two years.
SB 78XX(amended)
No Provisions.

Transmission System Purchase
SB _XX and SB 78XX
No purchase of transmission assets.

Conservation Easements
SB _XX
No conservation easements.
SB 78XX(amended)
Specific conservation easements and other land arrangements described in bill for about 24,000 acres per the Governor's MOU.

Direct Access
SB _XX
Removes regulatory constraints on a Direct Access program effective January 1, 2002 and permits customers to buy power if there is a net short after SoCal native generation, bilateral contracts, and DWR contracts.  Residential and small commercial customers may use direct access from renewable energy sources.
SB 78XX(amended)
No provisions for Direct Access.

Ratepayer Benefit Account
SB _XX
Deposits in the account any refunds or net cash resulting from (a) any refunds ordered by FERC or from litigation, and (b) any positive DWR Power Fund revenues; all to be refunded to ratepayers through either bill credits or rate reductions in proportion to the March, 2001 PUC rate increase.
SB 78XX(amended)
Does not create a Ratepayer Benefit Account.

Electric Supplier Claims Settlement Trust
SB _XX and SB 78XX
Does not create a Trust or trustee to negotiate reductions.

Renewable Energy
SB _XX
Creates a Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) to achieve a target of 10% of all new generating capacity additions through 2010 and overall 20% of statewide total generating capacity by 2010.  Munis have been exempted from the RPS.
SB 78XX(amended)
No provisions for renewable energy.

Two more say Duke withheld power: The company says it was responding to the
state grid operator.
By Kevin Yamamura
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 6, 2001)
Two more former workers from a Duke Energy power plant came forward Thursday
to bolster recent claims by colleagues that the power generator withheld
production to drive up prices.
But Duke attributed witness accounts of fluctuating generation to
instructions from the state's transmission-grid operator.
Richard J. Connors, an auxiliary operator, and E. Robert Edwards, an
electrician, said generation units at Duke's Chula Vista plant sat idle
during emergency periods for no apparent reason.
Three of their former co-workers -- two mechanics and a control room operator
-- told lawmakers two weeks ago that Duke had disposed of new parts and
varied its production.
While that testimony drew significant attention, it was countered Monday by a
report released by the state's Independent System Operator that showed the
ISO had in fact ordered Duke's up-and-down output Jan. 16-18.
On Thursday, the Charlotte, N.C.-based company leaned on the ISO report in
its defense.
"The ISO could have dispatched those units at will," said Duke spokesman Tom
Williams, referring to unused equipment.
But Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who has filed a lawsuit against generators,
contended that the ISO had based its orders on Duke's dubious bidding
history.
"These ISO orders came only after Duke had continuously manipulated the
market with price-gouging schemes forcing the ISO to regulate production,"
Bustamante said.
Connors and Edwards each worked more than 20 years at the South Bay plant in
Chula Vista.
For most of that time, the plant was owned by San Diego Gas & Electric. Two
years ago, Duke purchased South Bay and retained Connors and Edwards under
state-mandated agreements that ended in April.
Edwards said that during power blackouts in January, he saw a 225-megawatt
unit off-line. Other units, he said, were operating far below capacity.
"Our No. 1 priority in life was to make money," Edwards said.
Williams rebutted the claims as observations from those "who did not have the
complete picture."
"It's dead on, dead true that there are times when that plant is not running
at full capacity and there is a Stage 3," Williams said. "There may be
blackouts in San Francisco. But the reason why it's not running is because
the power can't move up Path 15 (a north-south bottleneck)."
Bustamante, however, maintained that Duke has continued to manipulate the
market, calling Connors and Edwards the "tip of the iceberg" in the
price-gouging investigation.
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the Senate committee
investigating price manipulation, said Connors and Edwards may testify before
lawmakers after further evaluation.
Dunn added that his committee has talked to potential whistleblowers from
other power generators who said they have seen production decreases and
suspicious activities. It is undetermined whether they will testify, he said.

Lockyer seeks SEC investigation of PG&E's financial transfers
By Ed Fletcher
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 6, 2001)
State Attorney General Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the federal Securities
and Exchange Commission to scrutinize financial transfers made to PG&E Corp.
from its subsidiary that has filed for bankruptcy protection.
"SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and the
people of the state of California," Lockyer said in a prepared statement.
Charges that PG&E Corp. hastened the bankruptcy filing of Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. have been made before, responded Greg Pruett, a vice president
of PG&E Corp.
"That is an issue that has been investigated multiple times by the Public
Utilities Commission earlier this year, by an Assembly oversight committee,
and in each of these audits there has been no conclusion that the transfers
were inappropriate or that they were injurious to PG&E Co.," Pruett said.
In its filing with the SEC, the attorney general's office said that "without
meaningful review by the SEC, it cannot be determined what impact the
transfer of assets ... may have on the financial condition of the bankrupt
utility."
An SEC spokesman said the commission has yet to examine the petition.
Among other concerns raised by Lockyer's office is the transfer of more than
$4 billion from 1997 to 1999 to PG&E Corp. from PG&E Co.
The majority of the $4 billion came from the sales of PG&E power plants, as
was required by deregulation.
"The bulk of the money went to pay debt that was incurred to actually build
those plants," Pruett said.
The rest of the transfers were to pay stockholder dividends, he said.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after having run up
$6.6 billion in debt.

California State Seeks SEC Probe of PG&E Transfers

California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer on Thursday asked the Securities and
Exchange Commission to investigate PG&E Corp. for potential abuses of its
responsibilities as a utility holding company.
At issue is a series of transactions over the last several years in which
PG&E Corp. transferred funds from its utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,
which now is operating under Bankruptcy Court protection. The money--more
than $4 billion since 1997--flowed to the parent company and to unregulated
sister companies of the utilities.
The transfers have been scrutinized by the California Public Utilities
Commission and the state Legislature with no finding of wrongdoing, said PG&E
Corp. spokesman Greg S. Pruett.
The SEC currently exempts PG&E from almost all requirements of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act because the San Francisco utility operates
primarily within California . That law regulates transactions between holding
companies and their utility subsidiaries.
Lockyer wants the SEC to withdraw PG&E's exemption, citing $13 billion in
PG&E assets outside of California .
"All the primary evils addressed by PUHCA are relevant to PG&E Corp.,"
Lockyer's petition to the SEC stated.
In Bankruptcy Court on Thursday, PG&E said it is close to reaching an
agreement with Calpine Corp. to pay more than $267 million it owes the San
Jose-based power generator and to preserve contracts for 453 megawatts of
relatively cheap electricity .
In all, PG&E buys about 2,600 megawatts of electricity from nearly 25
alternative generators, which are seeking repayment and release from their
contracts through Bankruptcy Court.

WASHINGTON -- The federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of
dollars in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday
that the talks are in trouble, and analysts said hope for a deal seems to be
fading.
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as
today if he sees no progress.
"The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks," said
Tamara Young-Allen, a spokeswoman for FERC. "He will do this only if he feels
the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit."
Originally, a preliminary report from the judge was not part of the plan.
Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the
weekend to try to get a deal by Monday's midnight deadline. If that failed,
the judge said he would take seven days to craft a proposed settlement for
FERC's governing board.
Kit Konolige, a power industry analyst with Morgan Stanley in New York, said
Wagner's announcement on Thursday amounted to a judicial distress signal.
"The judge wouldn't say something like this if the parties were close to a
settlement," said Konolige. "I suppose he may be trying to jump-start things,
but I think most people believed the sides were so far apart going into the
talks that it seemed like a long way to go to reach a settlement."
Although Wagner has imposed a gag order on participants, several people with
knowledge of the negotiations said Thursday that major power generators and
California officials have not budged from dug-in positions since the talks
began last week.
They also said the judge is extremely frustrated with the state and with
several large power suppliers.
California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the
generators have offered less than $1 billion. And some major power sellers
are insisting they do not owe anything.
Many experts say California has little hope of obtaining the $9 billion since
only $5.4 billion of that is attributable to sellers under FERC's
jurisdiction. On the other hand, it seems clear from statements by FERC
commissioners that the board is prepared to extract significant refunds from
generators.
Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure between $1 billion and
$9 billion. It could take the form of a mix of cash payments and discounts on
long-term contracts for power.
FERC's governing board ordered Wagner to hold the talks to see if a
compromise could be struck on three big issues: refunds, guarantees that
generators will be paid, and ways to shift more of the state's power
purchases to long-term contracts.
The board also made clear that it would impose its own settlement if the
state and power sellers were unable to come to an agreement.
Wagner said Thursday that if he issues a preliminary report today, he will
give all the parties a chance to respond publicly on Monday. Such a report
might embarrass some of the key players, since Wagner is known for his
plain-spoken conclusions. The judge would then prepare a settlement
recommendation for the FERC board by July 16.
However, he also said he is willing to work through the weekend to reach a
settlement if it appears within striking distance.
The talks are in a large hearing room on the second floor of the FERC
building near Washington's Union Station. Access is strictly controlled and
special badges have been issued to the more than 140 lawyers participating.
Some people with knowledge of the negotiations said Wagner's threat to issue
a report may be a bid to see if one of the parties will make a move.
"It was like a shot across the bow," said one source.

Davis energy team denied pay
State controller says work for Edison is a conflict of interest

N198197.DTL
Sacramento -- State Controller Kathleen Connell is refusing to pay two former
Clinton- Gore campaign operatives hired by Gov. Gray Davis, even though one
of the consultants dropped his Southern California Edison contract amid
conflict-of- interest allegations.
Mark Fabiani and Chris Lehane were collectively known as the "Masters of
Disaster" for their work in the Clinton White House during various federal
investigations. They also worked for Vice President Al Gore during the 2000
presidential campaign.
Because of their work for Davis, Connell says the contract Fabiani and Lehane
signed with Edison is a conflict of interest under state ethics rules. Davis
is negotiating with Edison on a bailout for the utility.
Late last week, at the bottom of a press release, Davis announced that
Fabiani was no longer a communications consultant because his work had been
"successfully implemented." Lehane, on the other hand, has dropped his
contract with Edison and signed a new agreement with Davis.
Lehane's new contract includes reimbursement for travel and meal expenses,
which he didn't have before, and requires him to work a maximum of 66 hours a
month at $150 an hour. His total payments are capped at $76,000 for work from
June 26 to Nov. 20, 2001.
In his release, Davis said Lehane would be paid the same amount as former
communications director Phil Trounstine, about $9,900 a month. But Connell,
like Davis a Democrat, said Trounstine undoubtedly worked more than 66 hours
in a month for his $9,990.
"We don't intend to be paying it," Connell said of the contract for both men.
"They represented Southern California Edison. You have to have a singular
relationship with the state of California and not show a conflict."
Previously, the Davis administration said there was no conflict because
Edison and Davis wanted the same things out of their negotiations. Earlier
this week, Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio said attorneys had different
opinions over whether the two consultants had violated ethics rules.
Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean said the governor had signed an executive
order allowing him to enter into consulting contracts with anyone he believed
could help him solve the state's energy crisis. She said Lehane had been
working full-time on public policy, even though his contract caps his salary.
The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly
monitors legislation, sued last month alleging that Fabiani and Lehane were
violating the state Political Reform Act because of the Edison contract.
In a recently filed disclosure statement, Fabiani also listed more than $10,
000 worth of consulting work for Cisco Systems, another company that
frequently brings issues before state authorities, including Davis.
The state Fair Political Practices Commission also is looking into a
complaint filed by GOP Secretary of State Bill Jones that Fabiani and Lehane
violated state ethics rules.

Ex-staff speaks out against Duke
Two more charge prices manipulated
Robert Salladay, Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

N122949.DTL
Sacramento -- Two more former employees at Duke Energy's Chula Vista power
plant came forward yesterday with allegations that the company manipulated
the energy market to drive up prices, although they offered no hard proof and
little new information.
Their accusations bring to five the number of Duke plant workers who say they
observed suspicious behavior, including the disappearance of parts needed for
repairs, the idling of generators for no apparent reason, and continual
stopping and starting that critics of Duke suspect was designed to withhold
power and artificially increase prices.
E. Robert Edwards, a 50-year-old electrician, related one conversation with a
Duke foreman sometime in January that prompted suspicion.
"I asked the foreman why Unit 4 wasn't running," Edwards said yesterday at a
press conference. "We had a 225-megawatt generator sitting there, and he just
shrugged his shoulders and said, 'I really can't tell you. I'm not privy to
that information.' "
State lawmakers have been focusing on whether Duke manipulated prices during
three days in January, when the company at one point offered a single
megawatt of power for a record-shattering $3,880. Duke says it was following
orders from the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power
grid,
when it repeatedly turned its generators on and off during those three days.
An ISO memo recently released by Duke confirms the company's contention it
was under orders. But January logs from the ISO and the generators don't
offer an explanation for every allegation of price manipulation, since Duke
has refused to release a detailed list of the prices it offered and paid
during that period.
The two workers who came forward yesterday, Edwards and 46-year-old Richard
J. Connors, both worked more than 20 years in the business. They left the
South Bay Plant in Chula Vista in April, two years after Duke purchased it
from San Diego Gas & Electric as part of deregulation.
SOME SHIFTS UNPOPULAR
"It is true units were taken offline, mostly on the weekends for whatever
reason," said Connors, a former auxiliary operator. "It got to the point as
an operator that you were dreading working swing shifts on Sunday or
graveyard Monday morning because you knew you were going to be running around
putting units back online."
Edwards said he had seen a company warehouse eventually emptied of parts that
are used to repair broken generators, although he didn't know where the parts
went. Forcing a longer wait for repair parts was designed to dry up the power
supply and push prices higher, lawmakers and other investigators suspect.
Edwards, however, admitted the warehouse was being cleaned out even when
SDG&E ran the plant. Duke contends the workers weren't familiar with Duke's
inventory system and couldn't possibly know why parts were being moved.
Duke and other energy companies are facing scrutiny by two legislative
committees, a 19-member Sacramento County grand jury, state Attorney General
Bill Lockyer, the California Public Utilities Commission and federal
regulators.
BUSTAMANTE ALSO SUING
Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante, who introduced Edwards and Connors yesterday, also
is suing a variety of generators in state court for alleged price
manipulation and bad business practices. He said Edwards and Connors
"reiterated what we've know all along -- Duke has been gouging California
consumers through its use and abuse of the South Bay Plant."
Duke offers a variety of defenses for its actions during the three days in
January and throughout the energy crisis. Tom Williams, a spokesman for Duke,
said Edwards and Connors had offered nothing new yesterday.
Beyond the ISO's 37 separate orders to stop and start generators during the
three days in January, Williams said state air regulations required the
company to shut the plant at certain times because it was running out of
emissions credits that limit the amount of air pollution it can put out.
Duke, which controls about 5 percent of the state energy market, also
contends the state's power transmission lines can't always handle an increase
in load.
"Yes, it's true there are times when that plant is not running at full
capacity, and there is a Stage Three (alert), and there may be blackouts in
San Francisco," Williams said. "The reason why it's not running is the power
cannot move up Path 15," the transmission line bottleneck near Los Banos.

Vallejo to produce its own energy
Conservation, generators expected to make city self-sufficient

Vallejo leaders, looking to escape mounting gas and electric bills, are
planning to build enough new power generators that the city government will
be self-sufficient when it comes to energy.
City officials said they believe that Vallejo is the first city in the nation
to take such an approach.
"This is going to be a showplace," said Scott Sossen, the chief executive
officer of Edge Capital Group, a funding agency based in Orange County. Edge
will be supervising the work along with O'Hara Energy Corp. of Nevada.
The plan comes at a time when the city expects to see its energy costs double
next year if it continues buying its power from PG&E.
"It couldn't be more timely," said Mayor Tony Intintoli.
Vallejo leaders are in the process of contracting with private business to
build new wind, solar and microturbine generators. Construction of a one-
megawatt solar generator could start within 30 to 60 days.
Conservation is also part of the plan, and energy-efficiency improvements are
already under way at Vallejo City Hall and the fire and police stations.
City officials hope to add enough sources of power generation to make all
city offices -- which consume about 10 megawatts a year -- self-sufficient by
the end of the year.
The Vallejo City Council gave tentative approval to the project late last
month and will continue its discussions on the plan next week.
Vallejo taxpayers won't have to pay any money in advance, because Edge will
finance the project's first $50 million in capital costs.
In return, a portion of the city's projected financial savings will be shared
with the Edge and O'Hara.
"This is a fairly sizable project," said Kevin Chambers, the chief executive
officer at O'Hara. "Energy-efficient capital is difficult to find because it
is such a new field."
O'Hara is installing high-tech energy management systems at all city-owned
property to reduce energy consumption. Final sites for the construction of
new wind, solar and microturbine generators have not been chosen.
In recent years, the energy bill for Vallejo city government has averaged
between $2 million and $3 million per year. That includes the police and fire
departments, City Hall and water-pumping stations.
Vallejo is part of a group of 50 local governments in Northern California
that pooled their resources to buy electricity and natural gas, keeping
prices down. But the group's current contract expires Dec. 30.
As a result, the city expects its energy bill to double next year, from 9.2
cents per kilowatt hour to 20 cents per kilowatt hour.
"It's been very positive what we've been doing, and it hasn't cost us
anything," said City Manager David Martinez. "We're going to be very
optimistic that this is going to be a good thing for the city."
City officials hope to eventually extend the plan to Vallejo's 4,500
businesses and 37,000 households.

SEC asked to see if PG&E Corp. violated law with subsidiary
Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News
BY JENNIFER BJORHUS

Mercury News


California Attorney General Bill Lockyer asked the federal Securities and
Exchange Commission on Thursday to step in to investigate whether PG&E Corp.
violated federal law in taking billions of dollars from its bankrupt
subsidiary.
``SEC scrutiny is essential to protect the public interest, ratepayers and
the people of the state of California,'' Lockyer said in a statement.
More than $4 billion flowed from the Pacific Gas & Electric utility to parent
PG&E Corp. from 1997 to 1999, according to Lockyer's petition, representing
nearly 70 percent of the cash that flowed to the parent company during that
period. PG&E Corp. spent $2.7 billion to buy back its stock, $1.5 billion to
pay dividends to shareholders and invested $800 million in its other
subsidiaries, according to the petition filed Thursday in Washington.
Those figures are similar to figures from a state-ordered independent audit
of PG&E Corp.'s finances released in late January.
By moving assets from the utility to other businesses, the company
potentially harmed the utility and violated the federal Public Utility
Holding Company Act in several ways, according to the petition.
The SEC is the nation's top cop for publicly held companies. But the
commission has not reviewed PG&E Corp.'s asset movements, saying the company
is exempt from scrutiny under the Public Utility Holding Company Act because
it's mainly a California operation and such intrastate operations are exempt.
The attorney general's office argues that PG&E Corp., with more than $13
billion of its assets outside the state, can no longer claim it is primarily
an intrastate company. The SEC should step in, it argues.
The petition surprised PG&E Corp. officials, who said they had no idea the
attorney general's office had an issue with the company's exemption from the
federal law, said company spokesman Greg Pruett.
Pruett said PG&E Corp.'s actions were appropriate because the federal utility
law only applies if a company has one or more of the following activities in
several states: electric transmission and distribution, gas distribution or
utility-owned generation.
``We have none of those things except in California,'' Pruett said, adding
that the National Energy Group, a PG&E Corp. affiliate, ``has natural gas
transmission but no distribution.''
``The power plants that NEG owns or operates are not part of a utility and
thus aren't regulated by PUCHA, and it has an energy-trading arm that is also
not regulated by PUCHA,'' he said.
The petition further asks the SEC to order PG&E Corp. to cooperate fully with
the California Public Utilities Commission. The state commission is
investigating whether PG&E Corp.'s corporate structure and its relationship
with its bankrupt utility violate state utility regulations.
The petition states it expects a response from the SEC within 60 days.
But SEC spokesman John Heine said there's no statutory deadline for a
response. He said he had not seen the petition and could not comment.

Judge may speed up electricity refund talks
Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News
BY RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR

Los Angeles Times


WASHINGTON -- A federal mediator seeking a settlement for billions of dollars
in alleged electricity overcharges in California signaled Thursday that the
talks are in trouble.
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., chief judge of the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, said he may issue a report on the closed-door talks as early as
today if progress is not made.
``The judge will perhaps issue a preliminary assessment of the talks,'' said
Tamara Young-Allen, a FERC spokeswoman. ``He will do this only if he feels
the talks aren't moving along as he sees fit.''
Wagner had previously said all sides would labor in private through the
weekend to try to get a deal by the deadline of Monday at midnight. If that
failed, the judge said, he would take seven days to craft a proposed
settlement for FERC's governing board.
California is demanding $9 billion in refunds. According to sources, the
generators have offered less than $1 billion.
Wagner is said to be probing for a compromise figure that could take the form
of a mix of cash payments and discounts on long-term contracts for power.














Davis keeps state addicted to fossil fuels
Published Friday, July 6, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News
BY JOE COSTELLO
BEFORE this year's energy ``crisis,'' Gray Davis wanted to be known as the
education governor. However, Davis and his advisers' energy teachings have
revealed alarming failures, setting back state energy policy not one or two
years, but one or two decades.
While George W. Bush proposed an energy policy tied to fossil fuels,
disproportionate building of centralized generation plants, too little energy
efficiency, lowering environmental standards and increased global warming
emissions, Davis enacted it.
First, Davis has tied the state for the next decade or longer to contracts
with facilities that are exclusively fossil fuel generation. Second, he has
encouraged an unprecedented surge in the building of new centralized fossil
fuel plants. Finally, he has pushed the lowering of environmental standards
to increase production from the dirtiest fossil fuel facilities.
The state's new energy purchasing department has spent zero on renewable
generation. David Freeman, the governor's energy czar, giving lip service to
alternatives, has negotiated close to $50 billion in long-term contracts with
fossil fuel generators.
By comparison, the governor has authorized investment of only $13 million in
expanding solar generation. Photovoltaic cells produce electricity directly
from the sun's energy, offering a clean, efficient solution to the state's
future peak energy demand. While the governor talks a lot about energy
efficiency, the state's funding of demand programs is about 1 percent of the
funding for supply. Most egregious, the vast majority of state energy
efficiency money is funneled back to the utilities.
While environmentalists deride the Bush administration proposals, in
California organizations such as the Natural Resources Defense Council
actively support Davis' fossil fuel energy policy.
The Davis energy policy has stuck California with the same old electric
system for at least the next decade. Money has literally been burned instead
of invested in innovation and creation of a cleaner and more efficient
system. The best hedge against price spikes is a diversity of fuel sources,
unfortunately California's electric system is now tied to an even greater
degree to fossil fuels.
After binding the state economy to the past, the Davis end game is logical.
Davis and his energy advisers want to spend tens of billions of dollars for
the utilities' restoration -- the very companies that for so long stifled
industry innovation and remain most responsible for California's energy
fiasco.
There is still an opportunity to make the best out of a bad situation.
Instead of bailing out the utilities, they should be dismantled and sold off.
A combination of a dozen or so local government and publicly owned companies
should be created with a goal of innovating the industry. An auction could be
held that would sell customer blocks and with it the state's long-term
contracts. Choice should be reinstated with the lifting of the suspension on
direct access to alternative suppliers.
Instead of moving the state to the next level of energy development, the
education governor's remedial energy teachings will force California to
repeat its energy lessons.

Business
Economics fuels power solution in California Price relief gains political
support
Robert Gibbons, BridgeNews

Political pressure coming from the U.S. Congress and politicians from Western
states seems to have influenced the approach to the power crisis, despite
opposition to price caps in the Bush administration.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission in June expanded price mitigation
measures on wholesale electricity sales in California during periods when
blackouts are possible.
The measures encourage generators to sell power into the state to prevent
emergency alerts from being declared, which trigger price caps. The move came
with support growing in Congress, especially among representatives of Western
states on both sides of the aisle, for legislation that would have capped
wholesale prices in the region.
The macroeconomic force may have been the difference between the $7 billion
cost of power for California in 1999 and its rise to approximately $27
billion in 2000. The cost is estimated to reach between $50 billion and $70
billion in 2001.
With that kind of money at stake, suddenly the concern becomes less a
question of who is responsible for the problem, but rather, how it can be
solved quickly to prevent harsh political consequences.
California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer has conducted an investigation into the
actions of power generators and offered multimillion dollar rewards to
whistleblowers to provide evidence of price manipulation by independent power
generators. The state is seeking refunds of $8.9 billion, the amount it
estimates independent power generators overcharged California 's troubled
utilities.
The U.S. General Accounting Office has released a report criticizing the FERC
for not finding evidence of power generators using plant outages to drive up
prices in California .
"FERC's [February] study was not thorough enough to support its overall
conclusion that audited companies were not physically withholding electricity
supply to influence prices," the GAO found.
Of the major independent power generators and marketers, like Reliant Energy,
Dynegy, Duke Energy and Enron, only Williams and its CEO Keith Bailey came
out in April in favor of some sort of short- term price relief for California
.
"The political dynamic out there is much more Draconian than what we're
proposing," Bailey told analysts in April, defending Williams' position
supporting some limited, short-term price mitigation.
What he was worried about was California Gov. Gray Davis using eminent domain
powers to take over power plants and the state setting up a public power
authority to build state-owned plants.









Financial
California Changes Stance on Refunds; Two Sides Far Apart In Energy Talks

California officials have abruptly shifted tactics in their attempt to
recover billions of dollars in alleged overcharges for electricity , saying
they may reduce their demands for huge refunds if generators renegotiate $43
billion in long-term electricity contracts that the state signed this year.
Gov. Gray Davis (D) said part of the $8.9 billion in refunds the state is
seeking could be offset by reductions in energy prices in the long-term
contracts, whose costs have become a growing political embarrassment for
Davis.
"We've made suggestions, we've offered various ways in which people could get
us $8.9 billion," Davis told the San Jose Mercury News in a report yesterday.
"You can renegotiate our existing contracts and save us money. However you
want to do it, it's just got to net out close to $8.9 billion."
The new offer was introduced this week into the closed negotiations over a
California settlement being conducted in Washington by Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr., according to sources close
to the negotiations.
Yesterday, Wagner said he may issue his own preliminary finding today on the
amount of overcharges if California officials and the generators cannot reach
a compromise.
"What I'm trying to do is get people in a settlement mood," Wagner told
reporters. "In the event we're unable to do that, [Friday] at some point I
may offer a preliminary assessment." The settlement conference is set to
conclude on Monday.
Wagner, FERC's chief administrative judge, has been trying to push both sides
toward a compromise that would resolve the huge energy pricing controversy.
Mountainous energy prices have bankrupted California 's largest utility,
drained billions of dollars out of the state treasury and put Davis at
sword's point with generators that help keep the state's lights on.
Last Friday, Wagner rebuked Davis's chief representative, Michael Kahn,
chairman of California Independent Grid Operator -- the state's power grid
manager -- indicating that the state's demand for nearly $9 billion in
refunds from power generators and marketers was too high, sources said.
Wagner's settlement conference, which has involved more than 100 lawyers for
all sides, is closed to the public and media.
Wagner complained last month that Kahn was following a political agenda, and
his lack of independence in the negotiations was such a "joke" that the
parties might as well wear "clown suits," according to a Dow Jones report
confirmed by sources close to the talks.
But he has also criticized the generators and power marketers, led by Reliant
Energy Inc., Williams Energy Services, Duke Energy and Southern Co., for
failing to make serious settlement offers, these sources said. The suppliers
have offered to refund $600 million, provided the state is able to call off
various California lawsuits demanding far larger refunds, sources said.
Wagner's leverage is his ability to propose his own refund figure to FERC's
commissioners. FERC has tentatively called for $124 million in refunds, but
now is taking a harder line on preventing a new escalation of California 's
electricity prices this summer and is likely to be receptive to a higher
refund figure, some energy analysts believe.
Davis's tactical change, offering to make the long-term contracts part of an
overall settlement, comes amid growing criticism of what the state will have
to pay for energy under those deals.
California 's energy calamity stemmed in large part from its failed
deregulation plan, which relied heavily on short-term power purchases at
volatile "spot market" prices. When energy costs shot upward last summer, so
did the state's electricity bills.
In response, Davis's aide, S. David Freeman, and his staff began negotiating
long-term power contacts with suppliers. The $43 billion in deals signed so
far would require the state to pay about $70 per hour for a megawatt of power
for a large part of the electricity it will need over the next 10 years.
That's well under the average of $250 per megawatt-hour that the state was
paying at the beginning of this year, but above current power prices -- and
considerably higher than what electricity may cost in the next decade, energy
analysts say.
A new agreement to lower those contract prices could relieve political
pressure on Davis and focus settlement negotiations away from the state's
controversial demand for the $8.9 billion refund. Davis will argue that
reducing future power charges that his administration negotiated should count
as a "refund" because the deals were reached "under commercial duress,"
according to sources close to Wagner's negotiations.
Industry supporters say Davis's refund figure is impossible to justify.
"There's no benchmark for what a fair and reasonable price should be," said
Michael Zenger, California director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates.
The state's advocates counter that if FERC enforced a "just and reasonable"
standard for power prices based on operating costs and a generous profit, the
overcharges by all sellers could easily reach the $9 billion figure.
"It's not rocket science, but it does require the regulators to regulate,"
said Frank Wolak, a Stanford University economist who heads an oversight
committee for the California grid.
Those polar-opposite views have left both sides in Wagner's conference room
"billions of dollars apart," as the talks approached their final weekend,
sources said.

U.S. Hearing Officer May Impose Pact
To End California Power-Overcharge Case
By Richard B. Schmitt

The Wall Street Journal
Page A10
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
WASHINGTON -- With settlement talks apparently stalled, a federal hearing
officer said he may propose his own solution to settle billions in alleged
electricity overcharges tied to the California power crisis.
Curtis L. Wagner Jr. said he was still "optimistic" California officials and
several power companies could come to terms on $8.9 billion in disputed
electricity charges the state has incurred over the past year.
Absent more-meaningful progress, he said he would offer his own "preliminary
assessment" and recommendation as soon as today.
In that event, Mr. Wagner also said, he would convene a hearing Monday where
the two sides would be given the chance to comment on his plans. Mr. Wagner
has previously indicated he feels California is due some refunds, but far
less than the total the state claims. California is also indebted to the
power companies for billions in previous deliveries; those debts could at
least partially offset any refunds. Mr. Wagner has also said long-term
contracts that would insulate the state from the sort of price shocks it has
experienced over the past year could be part of any resolution.
An administrative-law judge with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,
Mr. Wagner was named by the panel two weeks ago to broker a peace of the
overcharge dispute.
Commission officials have given the parties until Monday to reach an
agreement behind closed doors. After that, absent a settlement, the
commission has ordered Mr. Wagner to report back with his findings and
recommendations within a week.
At that point, the commission has said it will impose a settlement of its own
liking.
The overcharge issue has been a flash point in the California debacle, with
the state's governor, Gray Davis, calling the energy companies "pirates" and
"marauders."
The industry considers itself a scapegoat for a bungled state deregulation
effort.

David's conference call comments were extremely positive.  Highlights of his call include:
Enron is the "Tiger Woods of the energy industry" - Enron remains the premium energy company
Fundamentals are excellent; "Misperceptions" exist and will dissipate over time.
David believes earnings should grow 25% over the next 5 to 10 years .  Increased estimate to $1.85/share for 2001 and $2.25 for 2002.
Telcom is the one exception, where business is developing much more slowly than previously set forth
Enron issues/noise
California - Limited risk for Enron; Enron is part of the solution.
India - Extraordinary contractual protection. Unlikely to lose $ from Dabhol, more likely to gain.
PG sale - Enron will sell; not a negative in the shortrun
Asset sales slow - Weak Euro is a problem; Enron is motivated - CFO newly assigned; not an overhang; pending positive
Insider sales - Much has been pursuant to l/t sales programs to manage limited windows; Jeff has terminated his program
Wholesale - An investment bank?  Enron is much, much more than trading - risk management, structured solutions;  20%+ grower over the long-term; Very effectively extending the model to other commodities
Retail - Extraordinary capabilities;  >$15/share
Telcom - Absence of good counterparties has slowed business development.  Free call option that will be a good business.

Investor questions following David's comments tended to be from troubled/outspoken investors.   David was straightforward and effective in his responses.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


The train wreck known as California utility crisis continues along.  Democrats are turning on one another in the aftermath of the Assembly's failure to pass a SoCal bailout plan.  Meanwhile, talk of direct access is threatening to undercut the PUC's ability to hike rates, Davis' plans to issue bonds for a SoCal bailout, and the California state budget.

RJ

1.	Bryson and Davis Moving To Unseat Burton

There is a serious effort currently underway in California to unseat Senator Burton (D-San Francisco), President Pro Tem.   Even though the chances of this happening are relatively low, John Bryson, CEO of SoCal, with the support of the Governor, are making huge efforts to oust Burton and replace him with one of two potential candidates - Richard Alarcon (D-San Fernando Valley), Majority Whip or Sheila Kuehl (D-Los Angeles).  Alarcon has already stated that he would not accept the position.  However, at minimum, Bryson, Governor Davis and/or other Senators hope that Burton will rethink his position on the MOU and a SoCal bailout.

2.	Direct Access Talk a Serious Problem for SoCal and California Budget

Additionally, behind the scenes, things are looking very grim for California due the implications of Direct Access.  "Direct access," or the right of large companies and municipalities to buy power directly in the wholesale market, is fast emerging as a new and serious issue that could make a rescue of SoCal more difficult. It could also complicate existing state plans for the California electricity market and the proposed municipal bond sale, well placed Sacramento sources tell us.
The biggest opponent of Direct Access comes from the Governor's office as they realize the potential effects of direct access and how it could undermine the revenue stream supporting the bond issuance for SoCal.

For those interested in more on Direct Access keep reading:

Trying to stop municipalities from opting out of the state power plans will be extremely difficult, as it runs against some of the most entrenched and long-standing privileges in California politics. Under California law, it is very difficult to stop many cities doing what they please. Most older and larger cities are "charter cities" rather than "general law cities" subject to the California Municipal code. Under the California Constitution, charter cities can "pretty much do anything or provide any service short of printing money and raising an army," says one source. The League of California cities - a weighty organization representing every one of California's cities - is already swinging into action to support direct access. Most Assembly Democrats started out as City councillors and have some sympathy with local independence. And the resistance within the Assembly is already building against Hertzberg's attempts to stop even large companies getting direct access.

Some city leaders will not wish to fight the Governor and the state legislature on the issue. But if municipalities do not opt out, they may have to explain to their local business and voters why they are paying far more for electricity than a city next door which chooses to set up its own power company. Cities are beginning to realize they might potentially lose major employers. Politicians are also beginning to realize that local companies stand to gain or lose a fortune on the matter, and this could affect campaign contributions.

State power plans at risk

If municipalities do move to set up their own power companies, it could undermine at least three key elements of the State of California's power plans:
First, the rate hike already approved falls mostly on businesses and other large users. But municipal power would unpick this structure, allow large regions of California to ignore the PUC, leaving the rate structure to be determined city by city. Many municipalities may be unable to resist pressure from local businesses to protect them from disproportionate rate hikes. Others might cave into irate voters;
Second, the plans laid out by Governor Davis' and State Treasurer Angelides' for a California State Public Power Authority would also be badly damaged if large regions avoid having anything to do with it. "It is possible that long-term power contracts might also face an additional hurdle if municipalities opt out of higher long-term rates by buying on the open market," one source says. "It could mean the state is left with excess power that it would have to sell at a loss;"
Third, revenues to back the proposed power bonds could be imperilled, if municipalities opt out of the rate structure and revenue stream needed to repay the bond. And if the momentum for direct access develops among the cities and municipalities across the state, it could make it much more difficult to launch the bond in the first place as investors may take fright at potential threats to the viability of repayments.

The issue is at an early stage -- the PUC had a general workshop on the matter at its offices in San Francisco on Friday. So far, the matter has been seen as a micro technical issue rather than as one of the biggest hurdles the state will have to face. State legislative leaders are likely to use every political and legal means available to stop municipal secession, or at least smother the issue until the power bond is successfully away. But stopping the municipalities if they choose to follow this path could prove to be difficult

Ken, as you requested, I am participating in the World Economic Forum's task force on Corporate Citizenship/Corporate Responsibility and attended the first meeting last week in Geneva.  In addition, Mike Terraso and I met with the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.  Here is an update on those meetings and next steps.

WEF

Goals of the task force are:

To assess the business case for and practice and measurement of CSR.
To develop recommendations for consideration by members; and
To promote cooperation among companies, experts and stakeholders.

Companies attending included Van Heusen, 3M, Budimex (a Polish construction company), Deutschebank, ITC (an Indian packaging subsidiary of BAT), Accenture, Arthur D. Little, Suez, Electricite de France, and Siemens.  Representatives from these leading NGOs were guests: CERES, Business for Social Responsibility, the Price of Wales International Business Leaders Forum, the Conference Board and the Global Compact.  WEF staff Richard Samans, director of the Global Issues Centre for the Global Agenda, and Donna Redel,  Managing Director, moderated the meetings.

While a few of the companies have been active in CSR, many had not yet examined these issues internally and were just starting to think about the implications.  We had the types of discussions that companies typically have when they are embarking on something new, the same discussions we had at Enron over a year ago.  I don't think this was negative for a first meeting, and broadening the understanding of and interest in these issues will require a climb up the learning curve for many.  I did urge staff to broaden the group and involve companies such as Shell, BP, Reebok and others that have been leaders in the CSR arena.

Outcomes of the meeting:

1) Our task force will continue to evaluate best practices as well as policies, community investment, accounting and disclosure methodologies recommended by experts and companies.  We will also focus on emerging trends in CSR expectations among investors and lenders.
2) Chairmen/CEOs will be asked to discuss the CSR issue at a macro level and potentially adopt a position at Davos.  Task force members felt it was important that this be elevated to the Chairman/CEO level and to Davos if it is to be given the proper weight as a major issue for multinationals today.  I want our task force to have more discussions first, but I expect that I will ask you to consider participating in this component.

WBCSD

Mike and I met with individuals from all across the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.  We are delighted that you have agreed that Enron will join and think this effort it critical to both our environmental and corporate responsibility strategies.  I know that you reviewed WBCSD's materials, but their focus areas are wide-ranging and include sustainability, climate change, community involvement, emissions trading, corporate social responsibility and reporting.  WBCSD has six sectoral projects, and among those energy, forestry and mining and minerals may all be relevant to us.

Each member company is expected to have one council member, who are the most senior officers of the companies, and may have up to two liaison delegates (LDs), who are a variety of EHS, CSR and policy people.  Our recommendation is that you accept the Council member slot if you are willing.  Your main time commitment would be one meeting annually.  Mike and I would suggest that the two of us take on the LD roles since the topics seem to be equally split in relevance to each of our areas.  We also are allowed to appoint other staff people to work on specific initiatives as appropriate.

Please let me know if you agree with this.  I promised the membership director that I will advise him of your decision this week so he can get the paperwork in motion and announce our joining.

Let me know if you have additional questions.  Thanks.  Kelly.

I received from the TNRCC an NOV letter for the above facility for failure to
submit an emissions inventory for 2000.  This notification from the agency
originally came to Rick Loveless by way of Wayne Brunette.  I called the
TNRCC and spoke to Kevin Cauble concerning the NOV and he pulled the
emissions inventory submitted in 1999 for the facility.  Because VOC's are
the issue, I asked him what the emissions were for VOC's on the 1999
inventory.  Kevin stated that the inventory showed VOC emissions of 19.50
tons/yr actuals and 33.56 tons/yr potentials.  We discussed why EOTT would
submit an inventory as it is not a major source and not required to.  The
only thing we could come up with is that EOTT may have anticipated an
increase in throughput at this site and therefore, wanted to ensure that this
facility was shown as a title V source.  According to the phone records from
the TNRCC for this facility, Craig Willoughby of Entrix had  requested that
the faciltiy be kept on the list of facilities required to do inventories.  I
have a call into EOTT to determine whether increased throughput is proposed
for this facility in the near future.

In speaking with Kevin, he suggested that if a determination is made that if
there is to be an increased throughput that wont exceed the 100 ton/yr limit
on VOC's, or that throughput conditions remain approximately consistent with
previous years, EOTT should provide written notification to the agency that
this facility does not meet the applicability requirements of 101.10
(emissions inventory requirements) and request that this facility be removed
from the TNRCC mailings. Should EOTT confirm the status of operating
throughput to be below the 100 ton/yr VOC emissions limit, I will make make
written notification to the TNRCC requesting removal from the list.

Ivan,  the reason that you're having such a hard time making contact, is
because the Foundation is going through some changes in their management.
They are having a big pow-wow  this week to get things straightened out.  The
new CEO will be a person named Ron Marcoux, and I  will be speaking with him
next week.  In the interim, I have been working out some issues with the New
Mexico/Texas Director and am scheduled  to meet with the Arizona Director in
a couple of weeks.  Its pretty exciting to see the support from others in
Enron.  Based upon initial contacts with the Missoula headquarters and
regional directors, habitat conservation efforts are where the Foundation is
placing a large part of its emphasis.   Ill keep you apprised of the
partnership and how others can get involved after my discussions with the

Senate Majority Leader Eager to Push Energy, Environmental Issues
James Kuhnhenn


07/06/2001
KRTBN Knight-Ridder Tribune Business News: Knight Ridder's Washington Bureau

Reporter (TM)



WASHINGTON--Eager to exploit public dissatisfaction with President Bush's
approach to energy and the environment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle
wants to place those issues next on the Democratic agenda, before other
initiatives popular with Democrats.
Daschle's aides and party strategists say the Senate's top Democrat wants to
keep the White House on the defensive, draw attention to popular Democratic
goals such as promoting conservation and alternate power sources, and
inoculate his party against Republicans' charges that it has ignored the
country's energy needs. Activists on both sides see potential for compromises
that would lead to legislation Bush can sign.



"With summer, and gas prices, and air conditioning -- this is what you go
with," said Democratic pollster Fred Yang. "It's an issue that people
actually live every day. There are very few issues like that in politics."
Democrats think the energy issue has become an albatross for the White House.
Recent polls show that a majority of the public disapproves of the way Bush
is handling energy and environmental issues.
What's more, the House of Representatives voted to block the administration
from drilling for oil and gas off Florida's gulf coast and in the Great
Lakes. Both measures passed with support from 70 Republicans.
"When the Republican-controlled House soundly rejects key components of the
president's energy policy, it signals an opportunity to build a bipartisan
consensus that begins in the center," said Daschle spokeswoman Anita Dunn.
The decision to highlight energy policy came late last week after Daschle met
privately with his chairmen of key committees. Democrats present also called
for action on raising the minimum wage, hate-crimes legislation, a
prescription-drug plan for seniors and other issues popular with their
supporters.
But concentrating on energy policy first gives Democrats an opportunity to
seize what has been a Republican issue and turn it to their advantage, aides
said.
Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney are dogged by their backgrounds as former
Texas oilmen. From the moment Cheney argued for more oil and gas production
to satisfy the energy needs of the United States, Democrats portrayed Bush
and him as beholden to special interests.
"The White House and Republicans are in the 35 percent end of public opinion
on this," a top Democratic leadership aide, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said this week. "It's a loser every day for the Republicans."
With that in mind, Daschle and Sen. Jeff Bingaman, the New Mexico Democrat
who heads the Senate's energy and natural resources committee, plan to have a
comprehensive energy bill ready by the end of July. It will be a full- scale
alternative to the Bush-Cheney program unveiled in May.
The first floor disputes on energy policy could occur as early as next week,
when the Senate debates the spending bill for the Interior Department.
Republicans and White House lobbyists will have their hands full fending off
Democratic amendments to match the House bans on offshore drilling near
Florida beaches and on national monument lands.
The White House helped defuse some of the oil-exploration dispute earlier
this week by scaling back its plans to drill in the Gulf of Mexico. But huge
disagreements remain over drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge, a centerpiece of Bush's energy plan. Some Democrats intend to offer
an amendment to the Interior spending bill that would prohibit drilling in
the refuge.
Democrats also want to highlight energy conservation and lower emissions of
pollutants that contribute to global warming. One proposal, which combines
conservation and anti- pollution goals, would raise gas-mileage requirements
for sport utility vehicles. The National Academy of Sciences is studying fuel
economy standards and is expected to issue recommendations to Congress later
this month.
The energy debate also splits Senate Republicans, giving Daschle extra
manpower to challenge Bush. Democrats can count on New England Republicans
such as Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island and Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins,
both of Maine, to back several Democratic initiatives.
Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who already has opposed Bush on the patients' bill
of rights and campaign finance legislation, also has said he favors more
conservation measures than the White House proposes.
"He'll be very prominent in cobbling a centrist coalition on the issue," said
Marshall Wittman, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute
research center and a political adviser to McCain. "You can already see the
outlines of that proposal -- encouragement of conservation, some exploration,
but everything is environmentally friendly."
The White House already has reacted to the criticism of its energy policies.
Its budget proposal earlier this year cut research spending for renewable
energy, but Bush restored some of the money later. He also has paid more
attention to energy conservation, indicating support for spending on
efficiency measures beyond what he sought in his budget.
But the president is not backing away from his position that the United
States needs to become less dependent on foreign oil. And that, White House
officials say, requires more oil and gas exploration in the United States.
The energy plan Bush sent to Congress last week would authorize drilling in
the Alaskan wilderness refuge and would use money from the drilling leases to
pay for research into alternative energy sources.
In addition to public disapproval of his stands on the environment and
energy, the president is losing the sense of urgency that initially
accompanied his energy proposals. Rolling blackouts in California are on the
wane, gasoline prices are falling and last week John Browne, the chief
executive of BP oil, dismissed Bush's call for new oil refineries.
That gives Democrats a chance to seize the issue and attack the president
without competing pressure from the public for quick solutions.
"It's a target of opportunity," said Burdett Loomis, a political scientist at
the University of Kansas and an expert on the Senate. Like the patients' bill
of rights, on which the public sided with Democrats, energy right now "is
low-hanging fruit," he said.

Donna/Arnold  sorry about not making the conference call today.  The state of
New Mexico showed up at my office this  morning and made a surprise
inspection at one of our C/S south of Roswell.  I felt the need to tag along
with them....

Heres the way it is.  The EPA is required to address all federal concerns
when they are the lead agency is a permitting issue.  Even when it comes to
an issue like approving a turbine installation on previously disturbed
ground, they are required to ensure compliance with the Endangered Species
Act (ESA).  This is not a new issue with the EPA.  Im having the same thing
happen to me by the EPA I had called the EPA in San Francisco about the
status of the air permits for the Red Rock expansion for C/S 3 and 4.  The
permitting engineer told me that prior to issuance of the permits, their air
group would need assurances that the ESA regulations are being adressed.  I
told the engineer that becasue C/S 3 and 4 are on the reservation and that
the Navajo Nation has its own EPA group, that the ESA requirements are taken
care of by the Navajo Nation EPA.  (As you remember, the Navajo Nation
verbally told me that surveys would not be requried on the compressor station
sites for endangered plants and or animals).   I gave the EPA engineer the
Navajo Nation Fish and Wiildlife contact and he said that he would give him a
call and that he would also check this issue out with the legal attorneys
with the EPA.  Bottom line is that we are waiting for a response from EPA as
to whether surveys would be required or not.  I told him that we were
expecting the permits by the end of September and that if necessary, I would
schedule ESA surveys and circumvent this whole issue.  He advised me not to
do this.  I think his decision had something to do with  the EPA usurping
authority of the Navajos and asserting authority on Indian Lands without
Indian consent.  He said he would get back with me on this by Friday as to
whether their attorneys agreed that the jurisdiction of the EPA on Navajo
Lands when the Navajos have an environmental agency which administrates these
types of issues.

Im a little irritated that the EPA didnt notify me about this when it first
became an issue, but didnt pursue this as I didnt want to possibly  delay
issuance of the permits.  Ill send something out via email when I hear from
the EPA.

CalPX's position will be.  I was discussing the motion with PG&E's counsel
(Marty Courson) yesterday, mostly on timing issues (his schedule for
requiring  meet & confer this week, objections end of next week, and
production in five days, etc. is unrealistic), and he was complaining
bitterly that CalPX is "stonewalling", telling him it would one year and
millions of dollars to produce documents.  We need to be careful when we
formulate our position that we don't support (or look like we're supporting)
unreasonable positions by CalPX, who, I'm sure, doesn't want to allow access
to its records by anybody, anytime; at the same time, the Committee has an
interest in not draining the resources of CalPX (i.e., our money) on
overbroad and unreasonable document requests and fishing expeditions.

Scott McNealy at Sun asked us to send in an e-mail to him our issues with JavaSoft.  Mike took a shot at it and a draft is below.  It has not gone to him yet but we should get him something soon.

My comments are that the draft below is very accurate but is too long and detailed for a CEO and the last paragraph, thought factual, will change.

Can you please give me your comments so I can get back with Mike and Jay and finish something and send it to Scott?

Thanks.

We do need a formal plan.  We have been working closely together to identify the issues as they develop and propose solutions. Doug has been providing us with the necessary specific market information.  We have been successful in communicating that information to the new commissioners and Ercot and seeking resolution. The commission is definitely more responsive to market participants that are articulating the issue, providing specific examples and proposing the solution.  Grand-standing is ignored.  Those who show up with complaints but cannot point to specifics are virtually ignored.  Those who show up and complain, but are not participating in the working groups and the daily Ercot phone calls, board meetings, etc. are ignored.

Doug and I met with the Chairman of PUCT and have had subsequent conversations.  Thane and I also visited with him.

Pat Wood made a phone call to Tom Noel and told him to get the Texas market fixed.  (Even though he has bigger things to do in D.C., this is his legacy and he recognizes that if deregulation does not work in Texas, the repercussions could be global.)

Chairman Sibley and Chairman Wolens (of the Texas legislature) are also engaged in market developments.  We have been working with the State Affairs legislative committee and keeping them apprised.  There is an Electric Restructuring Committee hearing scheduled for September 6th or 7th.  The forum is expected to be invited testimony only.  Those currently listed as invitees are PUCT Commissioners and Ercot's Sam Jones and Tom Noel.  The hearing is focused on the pilot and we have an opportunity to provide some probing questions for Wolens to direct to Sam and Tom.  Now that Sibley is not a candidate for Lt. Governor, there is more freedom to open up and ask some difficult questions.

Thane is in Austin on Friday, but is available by phone.  I will be on a plane to Houston at 8:00 a.m. Can we find another time that works for us to meet? Thane is in an Ercot PRS meeting Friday from 9:30 until 3:00.  I am available after Rick's Friday budget meeting...are you available then?  You are right, we do need a formal plan, Thane has started an initial draft.  Thanks, Jean

As anticipated when the constraints of having  the "luck of the draw" taken out of the equation, I have moved into a first  place draw with Headley Jones in our newly formatted hockey pool. I never  once drew first pick in all previous Uncle Buzzy pools (remember him?) , so  this feels particularly sweet. With one game left, all I need is one point  from either Jason Arnott or Beretta Blake to stand alone. My only worry is a  Brodeur shut-out.
I offered Don Headley a split earlier when I was 7  points back, but he chose to poke fun instead. Charles, whose not even in the  pool, cried collusion, to which I explained to him that for this to be the case,  1. Discussions would have had to be held "in camera"  and 2. Others would have to be negatively impacted.  Neither of these criteria were met. I was simply being a good  capitalist.
Regardless, our American friends have yet to pony  in, nor has Galea ll, and I want my clams immediately! McConvey ( in  perhaps the orangiest, sweetest moment of all), please send the $20 owing  to my employer's address below, I do not want you having  access to my home address.
On as totally separate note, I'm beginning to now  look past when my son Yanic arrives and hold true in my very public decree that  having a child will not totally change my life. As such, we should open up  discussions on a second annual road trip, perhaps in late September? I know  Glove is very interested this year, and I'm sure Lav could be pried away from  cooking his companies books for a long week-end. We could always do Tremblant  again, but I'm in Mack's corner (for the first time ever!) in stating that I  could care less if we golf!!! Perhaps we could do Vegas, visit Lav or Glove (  which their respective wives would love) or simply go to my cottage. It doesn't  really matter, as long as we're together for a few laughs!!!!!! Air Canada is  offering $235 flights to Norfolk and Charleston, but that would obviously mean  golf, which increasingly irritates me with all its gimmicky  bullshit!!
So the floor is open for discussion, and knowing us  , I hope you all have enough space in your hard drive for the written  diarrhea that you're about to be assaulted with over the next month, until we  can all agree on something! Are you ready Charles? (" If he's in, I'm OUT!)".  Hey McConvey, are you going live a little outside that Weston comfort zone of  yours and spend a few shillings elsewhere?
Let the witchypooing begin. I'll explain that to  you later Lav.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


At our meeting in San Francisco yesterday a group of you asked we
re-publish our memorandum regarding the subpoena power of California
legislative committee. Here is a slightly edited version.



1. What is the basis of a  Legislative Committee's Subpoena Power?

Authority:   Government Code Section 9401, provides that "a subpoena
requiring the attendance of any witness before the Senate, Assembly, or a
committee may be issued by the President of the Senate, Speaker of the
Assembly, or the chairman of any committee before whom the attendance of the
witness is desired if permission has been secured from the rules committee
of the respective house."

Govt. Code Section 9402 provides that a subpoena is sufficient if it "(a)
states whether the proceeding is before the Senate, Assembly or a committee.
(b) is addressed to the witness [presumably the custodian of records when
documents are sought]. (c) requires the attendance of the witness at a time
and place certain and (d) is signed by the President of the Senate, Speaker
of the Assembly or chairman of the committee before whom attendance of the
witness is desired."

Contempt Power:  If the witness does not appear or refuses to testify or
"neglects or refuses ... to produce upon reasonable notice any material and
proper books, papers or document sin his possession or under his control, he
has committed a contempt."  Govt. Code Section 9405.   If the contempt is
committed while the Legislature is in session, Govt. Code Section 9407
provides that the committee shall report the contempt to the Senate or
Assembly "for such action as may be deemed necessary by the Senate or
Assembly."  If the Legislature is not in session, "the superior court in and
for the county in which any inquiry, investigation hearing or proceeding
[is] held ... may compel the ... production of books, papers, documents and
accounts, as required by the subpoena issued by the committee, on the filing
by the committee of a petition to the court asking that the witness be so
compelled."

Govt. Code Section 9409 provides that "any witness neglecting or refusing to
attend in obedience to subpoena may be arrested...."  It is unclear how this
provision would or could be applied to a subpoena issued to the custodian of
records of a non-resident company.

Motion to Quash Subpoena: California courts have held, under C.C.P. Section
1985, that a motion to quash is the procedurally appropriate method of
testing the validity of a subpoena duces tecum.  See e.g. People ex rel.
Dept. of Public Works v. Younger (1970) 5 Cal.App.3d 575.  My research has
revealed no case in which a subpoena issued by a legislative committee has
been challenged by a motion to quash, but, as noted above, there appear to
be only a very few cases interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et seq.   Therefore,
it appears that a superior court may be able to grant a motion to quash a
subpoena issued by a legislative committee (assuming that we want to take
the risk of state court jurisdiction).

In one early case, the Court of Appeal held that the contempt order and
accompanying affidavit issued by the Court upon the request of a Senate
Committee were fatally defective.  Ex Parte McLain (1950) 99 Cal.App.2d 274.
In McLain, the Senate Interim Committee on Social Welfare served upon Mr.
McLain, the Chairman of the Board of Trustees of a corporation a subpoena
calling for the production of various books, papers and documents.  Mr.
McLain appeared before the committee but refused to answer questions or
produce the documents.  Upon representation of the Committee, the Superior
Court issued an order directing Mr. McLain to produce the documents.  Mr.
McLain again appeared before the Committee and again refused to produce the
documents at which point, an affidavit was filed in Superior Court stating:

"That, based upon evidence in its possession, the said Senate Interim
Committee has determined that each of the books, papers, and documents
specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under
investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee, and the production of
such books, papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said Senate
Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and to
report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate
Resolution No. 162." and "That each of the books, papers and documents
specified in said subpoena duces tecum is material to the matters now under
investigation by the said Senate Interim Committee and that the production
of such books, papers and documents is necessary in order to enable said
Senate Interim Committee properly to perform the duties imposed upon it and
to report to the Senate of the State of California pursuant to said Senate
Resolution No. 162."

The Superior Court found Mr. McLain guilty of contempt and ordered him
committed to the sheriff until he produced the records.  The Court of
Appeals found that the order and affidavit were defective because "a witness
who is otherwise orderly and respectful cannot be adjudged guilty of
contempt unless the order affirmatively sets forth the materiality and
pertinency of the books and papers called for.  In cases of constructive
contempt, as is this, not only the order but also the affidavit upon which
it is based must sufficiently charge the alleged facts constituting the
offense."  McLain at 276.

This holding appears to be somewhat consistent with cases interpreting
C.C.P. 1985, which hold that the subpoena and affidavits must allege
material facts rather than conclusory statements.  See e.g. Grannis v. Board
of Medical Examiners (1971) 19 Cal.App.3d 551.

However, cases interpreting C.C.P. 1985 also require the subpoena to
demonstrate a level of specificity, materiality and relevance to be held
proper.  See e.g. Pacific Auto Ins. Co. v. Superior Court (1969) 273
Cal.App.2d 61.  It is unclear, but arguable that subpoenas issued by
legislative committees will be held to this same standard.


2.  What is the likely impact of a legislative committee subpoena issued
against Enron for out-of-state Enron documents?


There is little case law interpreting Govt. Code 9401 et seq. and the Govt.
Code reporters cross reference to the Code of Civil Procedure Sections on
issuance of subpoenas (C.C.P. 1985, et seq.).  Therefore, it is likely that
the provisions of both the Govt. Code and the C.C.P. will govern the
issuance and enforceability of a subpoena issued by a legislative committee.
Accordingly we use these provisions to analyze this question.


(a)  Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 1985 et
seq.

C.C.P. 1989 is entitled "Residency requirements for attendance of witnesses"
and provides that "A witness, including a witness specified in subdivision
(b) of Section 1987, is not obliged to attend as a witness before any court,
judge, justice or any other officer, unless the witness is a resident within
the state at the time of service."

However, there is a statutory limitation on the residency requirement
imposed by Section 1989.  Section 1987.3 provides "[w]hen a subpoena duces
tecum is served upon a custodian of records or other qualified witness as
provided in Article 4 (commencing with Section 1560) of Chapter 2 of
Division 11 of the Evidence Code, and his personal attendance is not
required by the terms of the subpoena, Section 1989 shall not apply."
(Evade. Code 1650 lays out the terms for compliance with a subpoena for
business records where the business is "neither a party nor the place where
any cause of action is alleged to have arisen.")

On commentator noted the following with respect to C.C.P. 1987.3:

"The rule limiting subpoenas to California "residents" (C.C.P. 1989) does
not apply to a subpoena duces tecum served on custodians of records unless
their personal attendance is required. See C.C.P. 1987.3; Amoco Chem. Co. v.
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London (1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 554, 561 fn.
9.  Thus, a nonresident custodian of business records may be required to
respond to a subpoena duces tecum served upon him or her while present in
California, by producing the records in accordance with Cal. Evid. Code 1560
(delivering copies of the records and accompanying affidavit to the court
clerk)... [However], C.C.P. 1987.3 probably applies only where the
nonresident custodian is employed by a business entity subject to California
jurisdiction. Otherwise, there would be no way for the court to enforce
compliance with a subpoena served on a nonresident.  See Amoco Chem. Co. v.
Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's of London, supra."

Werner, Fairbanks & Epstein, Rutter Group, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure & Trials at 1.57-58

Moreover, in one unpublished case, Allee v. King (1988) 206 Cal.App.3d 1081,
the court held that it lacked power to compel a nonresident defendant to
produce original out-of-state documents at trial.  In so holding, the court
stated that:

"even though King apparently voluntarily attended the trial, his presence
does not confer jurisdiction on the court to oblige him to deliver the
out-of-state documents.   Although section 1989 uses the word "witness" and
does not refer to documents, it has long been presumed under common law that
documents in other states are outside the court's territorial jurisdiction,
so that a court will allow the use of copies or other secondary evidence
instead of originals.  (See, e.g., Heinz v. Heinz (1946) 73 Cal.App.2d 61,
66, 165 P.2d 967, and cases cited therein.)   The recognition that
out-of-state documents are not subject to the court's process is in
conformity with the general rule under common law that, absent a statute
properly conferring broader powers, the extent of a state's subpoena power
and its accompanying subpoena duces tecum power is coterminous with its
borders.  (See 97 C.J.S., Witnesses, S 17, p. 367, S 23, p. 375, S 25, p.
380;  81 Am.Jur.2d, Witnesses, S 8, p. 32, S 14, p. 39.)

However, the Allee court notes that the "state-border" limitation on
subpoena power has not been extended to local branches of national
corporations who are subpoenaed to deliver documents which are out-of-state.
Therefore, even under Allee, if a subpoena was issued to an  Enron entity
within California that possessed responsive documents, that Enron entity may
be obligated to respond.  See Boal v. Price Waterhouse & Co. (1985) 165
Cal.App.3d 806.

Therefore, if a subpoena is issued which requires the attendance of an
out-of-state officer of Enron, Enron has a very good argument that that
witness is not obligated to attend under C.C.P. 1989.  It also seems
probable that, under Amoco and Allele cited above, if a subpoena is served
on an Enron custodian of records who is employed by a non-California Enron
entity, the subpoena may be invalid.  However, if a subpoena seeking the
production of documents is served on the custodian of records (or someone
similarly situated) who is employed by an Enron entity that possesses
responsive documents and is subject to personal jurisdiction in California,
that Enron entity most likely is obligated to produce the documents.  While
it is an open question, Enron can certainly argue that the custodian of
records employed by an Enron entity in California would only be required to
produce the Enron documents in the possession of the Enron California
entity.  (This question is addressed somewhat in the commentary on the
C.C.P. 2020 statutory scheme, see below, but is still open.)


(b)  Subpoenas against out-of-state residents under C.C.P. 2020 et
seq.

An additional threshold question regarding the territorial effect of this
subpoena concerns whether it is should be considered a deposition subpoena.
The question is:  If the legislative subpoena was treated as a "deposition
subpoena," would a court deciding the enforceability of a legislative
subpoena treat Enron as a "party" or as a "non-party"?

The rules governing the reach of discovery in California are obviously
different for the two.  The deposition of a party or party-affiliated
witness may be noticed (without a subpoena) for a place within 75 miles of
the witness' residence.  It is unclear how a court would resolve this issue.
After all, if a court was resolving the issue at all, an Enron entity will
have appeared before it. and would be a "party."  However, it seems
moderately more likely that the court would treat Enron's obligations under
the legislative committee subpoena as similar to its obligations if it was
served with a "non-party" subpoena.

There are three types of "deposition subpoena":  a "testimony only subpoena"
(requires only the attendance and testimony of the witness), a "business
records subpoena" (requires only the production of business records) and a
"records and testimony subpoena" (requires both -- also formerly called
subpoena duces tecum).  The second of these is the most relevant to Enron.

The attendance of an non party out-of-state witness or the production of
documents can be compelled only under the law of the place where the
deposition is to be taken.  C.C.P. 2026 (b)(2).  Specifically, C.C.P.
2026(b)(2) provides "If the deponent is not a party to the action or an
officer, director, managing agent, or employee of a party, a party serving a
deposition notice under this section shall use any process and procedures
required and available under the laws of the state, territory, or insular
possession where the deposition is to be taken to compel the deponent to
attend and to testify, as well as to produce any document or tangible thing
for inspection, copying, and any related activity."

Some states issue subpoenas routinely, some require a showing of materiality
or relevancy, and some require a commission from the court where the action
is pending.    This question will depend on the law of the state when the
custodian of records resides.

Regarding the question of whether the service of a deposition subpoena on an
in-state custodian of records would compel the production of out-of-state
documents.  Weil & Brown, Rutter Group, California Practice Guide: Civil
Procedure Before Trial at 5:540.4 notes:

"It is unclear whether service of a "business records" subpoena on a
nonparty corporation in California compels production of its records located
outside the state. ... C.C.P. 2020(d) requires that the subpoena be directed
to the records "custodian" (or someone authorized to certify the records).
Whether "custodian" requires actual custody of the records is unclear. If it
does, serving an officer or agent in California would not compel production

We have intervened in Georgia Power's rate case.  Bob Frank will be our counsel and any issues regarding external communication about this case should be directed through him.

We plan to address 3 issues: 1) GP's proposal for weather-related revenue sharing proposal (we'd like to see use of weather risk management; 2) support for GP's proposed capacity cost recovery rider, under certain conditions, and 3) reflection of risk reduction these first 2 issues would allow in GP's authorized ROE  (we will not address the underlying ROE).

Donald Lassere, Stella Chan and I will be working with Andy Anderson in URM and the weather desk (through Lisa Yoho)to develop our positions and testimony.

The completion of the identified scrapable East Desk pipes is in site (pun intended :-)...there are only a few outstanding issues remaining.  The pipes in question are:

-  National Fuel and Gas
This site does a bit of checking to verify how you get to them...basically, it appears they make sure you come to them from a source they trust.  Attempts to work around this have so far failed, so Tara has placed a call to them directly to try and get a resolution to this problem.

-  TCO
We have discovered a work-around for the strange Javascript issues of this site, but now have discovered that this alternative way to access the data does not necessarily report as much as the original.  Sabina is looking into this, contacting the pipeline themself for help.

-  CGT
This is a "sister" pipe of TCO, and thus has the same Javascript issues.  We have also found a way around this, but Eddie is not completely certain the data is the same.  I'm going to work with him this afternoon to see if together we can figure it out.  It may be that CGT has the same problem as TCO (not as much data reported in the alternate method).

And that's it!!  TETCO has been finished today, and Iroquois has been set up as a manual entry pipe.  So, from what we can see, finishing the above 3 pipes finishes off the everything identified thus far for the East Desk.

Now, my only question is ...who's bringing the keg in on Friday?!? ;-)

As always, any questions, just ask.

Thanks,
Chris

FYI.

California Struggles in Role
Of a Large Buyer of Power
By REBECCA SMITH
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL


Despite proclamations by Gov. Gray Davis that California finally has gotten
the upper hand over its electricity crisis, there are new signs that the
state is struggling in its role as an enormous power buyer.

For the first five months of this year, the state Department of Water
Resources, in charge of purchasing electricity on behalf of two big,
financially ailing California utilities, bought too little power to meet the
state's needs and, as a result, risks triggering $1 billion in federal
fines. Then, for the past few weeks, the DWR, as the agency is known, has
been buying too much electricity, potentially saddling rate payers with the
cost of juice they won't ever actually use.

Finally, a slew of long-term contracts the state signed with suppliers,
intended to calm a volatile spot power market that sent prices to record
levels in recent months, may actually end up being too expensive. As new
power plants crank up here over the next two years, Californians appear to
be locked into paying rates for as many as 20 years far in excess of what
market prices are likely to be.

State officials defend their power-management work, saying the negotiation
of the long-term contracts and the daily power-purchasing record of the DWR
have helped bring down electricity prices from punishing levels in recent
weeks and have reduced the threat of blackouts. S. David Freeman, the
governor's energy adviser, likens the state's job performance to "a plane
that landed safely" after undergoing harsh turbulence.

If so, it is a pretty bumpy approach. Take the case of purchasing too little
power. Back in December, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission imposed
financial penalties designed to compel California utilities to lock in more
power on the "forward" market and to reduce their dependence on last-minute
purchases that jeopardized electric-system reliability.

But in the 163-day period between the time the penalties were ordered and
June 12, the DWR was judged by regulators to have purchased too little power
77% of the time. That, in turn, triggered penalties of $100 for each
megawatt hour of power purchased by the California Independent System
Operator, above certain thresholds, in its "real time" energy market.

State officials notified FERC late Friday that the penalties had become
astronomical and asked that they be eliminated. In its meeting Monday, FERC
is expected to roll out broader price controls for the Western power market.
But it isn't expected to address the penalty issue.

Now the state faces a new problem of at times purchasing too much power,
partly due to the activation of 38 long-term power contracts signed by the
state since January. On Friday, Gov. Davis released heavily censored copies
of these documents after a judge compelled him to do so as a result of
lawsuits brought by Republican state legislators and a consortium of news
organizations, including The Wall Street Journal. The plaintiffs will go
back to court June 22 to request complete disclosure of the contract terms.

In news conferences Friday and Sunday, state officials depicted the
contracts as a victory for the state, which has been grappling with a huge
supply-and-demand imbalance in its electricity market since last summer. "We
had a mighty tussle to negotiate these contracts," said Mr. Freeman, adding
that they provide energy at prices "anyone would consider just and
reasonable."

Some industry executives believe the contracts tell a different story. Jack
Adrian, a power-industry executive who has been building power plants for 39
years, said his analysis leads him to believe "there's nothing to boast
about here. The suppliers are getting the best of a desperate customer."

Mr. Adrian, chief executive of California-based Delma Power Co. and a former
executive at Edison International, parent of one of California's ailing
utilities, said it is impossible in some instances to determine what prices
the state has committed to pay because key pieces of information have been
deleted. But he said where numbers are available it is clear that "prices
are way too high, several orders of magnitude higher than anything ever
permitted the utilities."

Many of the contracts contain "take or pay" provisions that commit the state
to pay for power for five to 20 years, whether or not it is needed. That may
help to explain why in June a new problem has cropped up -- "overscheduling"
-- where the state, at times, has ordered too much power to be delivered. To
keep from overloading electric lines, the ISO has had to order some
generating units to produce less juice.

In the first 13 days of June, there were excess-supply problems on nine
days. It is unclear if the state was able to resell any of that excess power
and, if so, at what prices. State officials declined to comment.

An examination of the long-term contracts shows about half contain fixed
power prices. The rest have prices that fluctuate depending on fuel costs
and other factors. Mr. Freeman said the state has negotiated prices that
average $69 a megawatt hour for the next 10 years.

For now, though, according to the state's own statistics, it appears
California is paying substantially more than that. In five of the past six
months, spot-market prices have been lower than the average price paid by
the DWR.

Mr. Freeman said forward contracting by the state is the reason spot prices
have fallen. Regardless, it puts the state in an awkward position. Before
FERC it is arguing that spot power prices are neither just nor reasonable
and must be restrained. It also wants multibillion-dollar refunds from
wholesale power suppliers. Yet, within California, state officials are
making the case that the prices in the contracts it has signed are fair even
though they are, in many cases, higher than spot prices.

Analysts say it isn't clear how the state intends to resolve this apparent
contradiction. In effect, they note, California is seeking refunds from
generators on the lower spot-market prices they charged, while trumpeting
contract prices which are, in many cases, higher.

Read all the way to the end or you will miss out.

A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items in front of
him. When the class began, wordlessly he picked up a large empty mayonnaise
jar and proceeded to fill it with rocks, rocks about 2" in diameter. He then
asked the students if the jar was full? They agreed that it was.

So the professor then picked up a box of pebbles and poured them into the
jar. He shook the jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open
areas between the rocks. He then asked the students again if the jar was
full. They agreed it was. The students laughed.

The professor picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of course,
the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor, "I want you
to recognize that this is your life. The rocks are the important things -
your family, your partner, your health, your children - things that if
everything else was lost and only they remained, your life would still be
full.

The pebbles are the other things that matter like your job, your house, your
car. The sand is everything else. The small stuff."

"If you put the sand into the jar first, there is no room for the pebbles or
the rocks. The same goes for your life. If you spend all your time and
energy on the small stuff, you will never have room for the things that are
important to you. Pay attention to the things that are critical to your
happiness. Play with your children. Take time to get medical checkups. Take
your partner out dancing. There will always be time to go to work, clean the
house, give a dinner party and fix the disposal."

"Take care of the rocks first - the things that really matter. Set your
priorities. The rest is just sand."

But then... A particularly adept student took the jar which the other
students and the professor agreed was full, and proceeded to pour in a glass
of beer. Of course the beer filled the remaining spaces within the jar
making the jar truly full.

The student said " You know, no matter how full your life is of big and
small things, there is always room in it for BEER."

A Mexican is strolling down the street in Mexico City and kicks a
bottle
laying in the street.
Suddenly out of the bottle comes a Genie.
The Mexican is stunned and the Genie says, "Hello master, I will grant
you one wish, anything you want."
The Mexican begins thinking, "Well, I really like drinking  tequila."
Finally the Mexican says, "I wish to drink tequila whenever I want, so
make me pee tequila."
The Genie grants him his wish.
When the Mexican gets home he gets a glass out of the cupboard and pees
in
it. He looks at the glass and it's clear. Looks like tequila. Then he
smells the liquid. Smells like tequila. So he takes a taste and  it is
the
best tequila he has ever tasted. The Mexican yells to his  wife,
"Consuela, Consuela, come quickly!" She comes running down the hall and
the Mexican takes another glass out of the cupboard and pees into it. He
tells her to drink, it is tequila. Consuela is reluctant but goes ahead
and takes a sip. It is the best tequila she has ever tasted.  The two
drink and party all night.
The next night the Mexican comes home from work and tells his  wife to
get two glasses out of the cupboard. He proceeds to pee in the two
glasses.  The result is the same, the tequila is excellent and the
couple
drink until the sun comes up.
Finally Friday night comes and the Mexican comes home and  tells his
wife,
"Consuela grab ONE glass from the cupboard and we will drink tequila."
His wife gets the glass from the cupboard and sets it on the table. The
Mexican begins to pee in the glass and when he fills it his wife asks
him, "But Pancho, why do we need only one glass?"
Pancho raises the glass and says, "Because tonight my love,  you drink
from the bottle."

PLEASE FORWARD TO ANYONE APPROPRIATE:

Judge Wagner issued a public Proposed Recommendation (the media was in the
room) to resolve the matters before the Settlement process late Monday
afternoon.

He initially talked about "can bring a horse to water, but can't make him
drink."

He went on to detail that the Suppliers had offered $716.1MM for Settlement
($510MM for Duke, Dynegy, Mirant, Williams, Reliant + $125MM for Powerex +
$49.6MM for 15 marketers + $6.5MM for 6 CMUA members + $25MM for outside
Calif Utilities [includes PGE]).  He said thought refunds in the hundred of
$millions or maybe $1billion were right.

His will propose the following method to the Commission.

1. Retroactively apply the June 19 Order from Oct 2 - June 19.
2. Modify that decision to (a) use actual heat rates from marginal unit in
NP15 and SP15, (b) use two daily gas prices - north CA and south CA, (c)
incorporate NOx costs, (c) add a 10% credit premium.
3. Commission should hold an expedited 60 day hearing on matters relating to
questions of material facts (Mwh sold, gas prices, etc).

He did indicate that his perspective was that the moneys owed could be offset
against CAISO bills.

Importantly, we are unsure if the Judge will recommend to have FERC  (a)
determine that upon the application of this refund Order the rates are
determined to be J&R, (b) ensure that all buyers in these markets get similar
refunds, (c) limit the refund to not include CDWR and CAISO Out-of-Market
transactions.

We are intending to communicate with the Judge's staff tomorrow on these
issues to seek clarity.

Finally, is it appropriate to have Charles River Associates attempt to
calculate the refund liability?  We may want to understand the risk under
different assumptions.

Thanks,

Jim

Tom Briggs and I believe that prior to this meeting we should hold an internal session so that we can fully understand what FERC is capable of doing under its existing jurisdiction that effects our portfolio trading operations.  For example, does FERC have the legal authority to compel certificated marketers (EWGs) to maintain certain credit standards, reports on transactions, require that portfolios be balanced or fully hedged, and other items.  Such a discussion would illuminate our ultimate question of strategy, namely whether we believe that this is an area FERC is allowed to examine or whether or position is that these issues are the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC.   With respect to your specific suggestion below, we are fine with this approach if it follows the discussion suggested here.

I would recommend the following --

1.	Enron take a group of traders / commercial people to FERC next week.
RECOMMENDATION --  Hunter Shively, Bob Superty, Stephanie Miller
2.	Target Audience:  Commissioner Wood's office (him if possible), Kevin Madden, Don Gelinus, other key staff?
3.	Message:  Price in Production Area + Transport DOES NOT EQUAL Market Area Price
Financial Markets are Deriviatives of Physical Markets (You Can't Set Price By Financial Trading)
We are Portfolio traders and therefore can't "identify" supply and demand on each "deal"
AVOID WESTERN GAS CRISIS DISCUSSION

If people agree, let's talk with commercial people today.

Dear Trevor, Michael and Laura,

Good talking with you all this morning.  Based on our discussion, I will work with you to get intelligence on the following emissions markets:

SO2
NOx
Houston-Galveston - Stacey Bolton is the resident expert, but feel free to use me as main point of contact for the group
CO2 (desk in monitoring and gathering intelligence at this point)

Ongoing projects include intelligence on:

industry dynamics and descriptions of coalitions on NOx, SO2 and CO2 emissions issues, specifically multi-emissions legislation
what are their priorities, and any information that may indicate their positions

How and when are the current emissions trading programs going to roll into the new programs?
how will that impact holders of allowances, etc.

bios of new administration officials with decision making authority on emissions issues at EPA, CEQ, WH, others.

tracking of emissions trading lawsuit in New York, and similar cases as they arise

I will de-brief with Laura next week on the lawsuit issues and will begin working on descriptions of the industry dynamics on multi-emissions proposals and bios of new administration officials.

As for follow-up with EPA on treatment of allowances under new national NOx and SO2 programs -- working with Kevin, John, Jeff Keeler, Lisa Yoho and Pat Shortridge (DC lobbyist) -- we should identify the key issues and develop a strategy.   Jeff suggested a conference call to discuss this.  I will check in with him and follow up if necessary.

We will also begin our weekly conference calls, starting Tuesday, August 14 - say 9:30 Houston time (please let me know if you would like it to be earlier in the morning or start on a different date)?

In the meantime, just give me a ring if you need anything,

The following individuals have been identified for the training/knowledge sharing that was discussed at this week's meeting.

Randy Bryan, Mike Bodnar, Legale Black, Richard Hanagriff, Alice Johnson, Dennis Lee and Jim Studebaker

As discussed, the session will cover the following:
1.  Inventory of commonly used Universes and their data structure (4 hours)
2.  Description of the canned reports that currently exist and how they are being used.  (2 hours)
3.  Q&A and assistance in developing reports (2 hours).  This was not discussed but I think this would be a valuable use of time.

The GL directors agreed that along with notifying these individuals that they will receive further Business Objects training, they are to bring a list of needed reports from their respective areas to develop in the days (or weeks) immediately following the class.

Gas Logistics goal is to develop individuals that can create complex reports using Business Objects and reduce its reliance on IT and Don in developing such reports.

Please let us know when you think you will be able to hold the session.  Our expectation on timing is within the next six weeks.  Mike Bodnar will be the "lead" from Gas Logisitics so please rely on him for support.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Allison and I had a good discussion with Boucher's telecom staffer/leg
counsel, Johanna Mikes.  She hadn't heard the Enron/EBS story, so first
provided that.

We then discussed the specifics of the cable issue, and learned from Johanna
the following:

a) the bill will be introduced in Judiciary, not in Energy and Commerce
b) this year's bill will not include any of the 251 sections which were
contained in last year's legislation (and which I told her off-the-record
would be a deal killer for Enron)

She accepted our suggestions that the language as currently written covers
only broadcasters, ie, those who already have some access to the cable
platform.  I suggested they include provisions that cable operators not
discriminate against non-affiliated video programming and other ITV content,
and further that they not discriminate against this type of content delivered
via the internet.  She accepted these suggestions.

Boucher will now draft new language and share it with us.  After we
comment/sign-off, they'll approach Bob Goodlatte for co-sponsorship and
buy-in.  Disney and others will play high profile roles as well.

Boucher very much wants Enron's support on this -- and given the openness
with which our comments were received, as well as the fact that they will
withdraw the damaging 251 clauses and make this a focused cable access bill,
I would suggest you relay our full support and appreciation to Boucher when
you see him next week.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Amanda Smith, Peter Meringolo,  and I met with officers and
administrators at the San Francisco offices of Enron Corp. this morning and
identified documents responsive to  the Dunn committee subpoena. Amanda and
Peter then collected and reviewed potentially responsive documents in the
afternoon. They will continue to do so, with the assistance of two
paralegals, tomorrow. Assuming we do not produce documents relating to the
development and siting of generation facilities ( which comprise the lion's
chair of the documents in San Francisco) we estimate there are about ten
boxes of responsive hard copy documents in the office. However, we have not
yet reviewed any electronic documents.  The following summarizes these
discussions and the status of document identification:

Most of the documents in the SF office correspond to one of the
three major functions of the office.  The predominant operation is the
development of power generation facilities in the Western United States
under the supervision of Dave Parquet. Second, the office markets wholesale
power to municipal utilities and other customers under the direction of Mike
McDonald. Both these operations are done by Enron North American and  both
Parquay and McDonald are vice presidents of Enron North America. McDonald
works closely with EPMI in Portland. The final significant function of the
office consists of legislative and regulatory affairs, which is part of
Enron Corp and managed by Sue Mara.

We reviewed many of the documents within the custody of persons
working under the management of Parquet and Mara. McDonald is on vacation
until June 11 and has not returned phone calls to his home message machine.
Given his close relationship to EPMI in Portland we need to reach him soon
to interview him on the subject. He is said to have potentially sensitive
pricing and financial information relating to wholesale power on his hard
drive.  The following summarizes our review of the documents in the Parquet
and Mara supervised operations.

Mara:  Many documents may be privileged. Non-privileged documents do
not appear especially sensitive- examples are reports of trade association
meetings and PUC and other regulatory proceedings.

Parquet: Parquet was on the board of ISO. He has about two boxes of
responsive ISO information. Most appear non sensitive, but may require
notice to ISO prior to production.. There is also some bid information
regarding an Enron offer to buy a PG and E generating facility later
purchased by Mirant. These documents are also non-sensitive. Parquet has
financial documents, including the allocation of profit and loss to certain
Enron subsidiaries.
However, there are tens (50 to 100) of boxes of documents relating
to power plants Enron has or is  planning to develop in the Western United
States. Generally, these type of documents do not appear called for in the
subpoena. However, embedded within these development plans are documents
that are responsive to other categories of the subpoena and sensitive- such
as pricing curves, information about future contracts, and forecasts of
supply and demand for power.  Parquay says these are competitively sensitive
documents. It would take several days to review these documents.  Further,
many contain third party information subject to  confidentiality agreements
with such third parties. If we produce them we would need to notify these
third parties soon. I suggest we not produce these documents but do so
openly by disclosing to Drivon that we are treating documents relating to
siting of power plants not operated by Enron as non-responsive.

McDonald: This operating unit has few hard copy documents. Most
sensitive information is said to be on McDonald's hard drive, including
financial information that reportedly shows how much money Enron made in
California in the past year or two by selling wholesale power. Someone needs
to reach McDonald so we can ask him about it.

Document retention: The office manager says that a backup tape is
made of the server and the "H" drives on each computer every day. 20 days of
backup tapes are kept before they are overwritten. The backup tape from
every fourth Friday of each month is kept permanently. They believe e-mail
is so preserved on this back up tapes, but say that only people in "
Houston" know for sure. We should find out. We asked the office manager to
retain copies of all backup tapes going forward.

EES: The EES personnel in San Francisco have few responsive
documents. The Dunn subpoena asks for all of Enron's contracts for retail
sale of power, which are also requested by the AG from EES. These  probably
total 20 or so boxes. We will ask the EES offices in San Ramon and Costa
Mesa offices, which house these contracts, to copy them and send them to us
for our review. We will hold them until we make a decision whether to
produce them, either to the AG or Dunn.

PUC production: Enron previously produced about a half box of
documents to the PUC. Most are responsive and should be also produced to
Dunn.

I expect we will have completed at least a cursory review of the
responsive hard copy documents in San Francisco that do not pertain to plant
construction and operation by tomorrow afternoon. We then need to review the
documents on the hard drives of Parquay and McDonald, hopefully by Thursday
afternoon. We will collect examples of  the most sensitive documents we find
tomorrow and send them Tuesday evening to Bob Williams for review .

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


To all,

Well, if you didn't already know...we didn't make it to Texas!  We were
suppose to fly out of Frankfurt, Germany on Tuesday, June 5th but Jason got
sick.

Sunday late afternoon, Jason said his mouth hurt and we had our neighbor
who is a doctor look at his throat.  It was a little red but nothing serious
(at that point).  Nolan and I had had sore throats over the last two weeks
that lasted a few days so I figured Jason would be recovered by the time we
arrived in Houston.  Then, I stayed up until 5am Sunday night/Monday morning
doing laundry and packing.

Monday, Jason and Nolan went to school and all seemed well while I ran
around doing last minute errands.  That evening, Wayne drove us to Wuerzburg
so that we would only be 1 1/2 hours from the airport in Frankfurt rather
than 3 1/2 hours.  The boys both seemed fine and played outside for an hour
or so when we arrived.  We were staying with friends.  During baths, Wayne
noticed a rash on Jason but didn't think anything of it.  But, as we were
putting him in bed, Jason seemed hot.  We took his temp (over 102) and gave
him motrin.  Then, since the main military hospital is in Wuerzburg, we
decided to take him in to get him started on some medicine if needed.
Before he left, we looked in his throat--this time his tonsils were almost
touching they were so big and all spotted.

Needless to say, Wayne returned with Jason just before midnight with the
diagnosis of Scarlet Fever!  With a rash, spotted tonsils, and 103 fever, it
was an easy diagnosis.  It sounds terrible but is basically a bad case of
Strep throat accompanied by a red rash (ie where the "scarlet" comes from).
The doctor advised that Jason should not travel for at least 24 hours and
would not be contagious after 24-48 hours.  The doctor also said that the
incubation period was anywhere from a few days to 2 weeks.  So, Nolan and I
had both had good exposures to it since we had slept with Jason in the last
few nights as well as daily activities.

So,not wanting to spend the entire time in Houston sick or avoiding Bob
(since he is immune suppressed due to the transplant), I tracked down my mom
and had to cancel our trip.  This occurred at about 1am Germany time--only
about 10 hours before we were suppose to fly!!!  Talk about last minute...we
were all disappointed.

Well, we slept in Tuesday morning.  But, when Jason woke up and said,
"Mom, you know what...Today is Texas Day!!" it brought tears to my eyes.  We
had all been so excited about going to Texas.  So, we explained to Jason
that...the plane broke and that we have to get new tickets (I didn't want
him to feel responsible).  Now, he keeps telling everyone that the plane
broke and we are going to get new tickets so we can go to Texas tomorrow!

Jason is doing fine--you wouldn't even guess he is sick by looking at
him. Although he has been taking his medicine, it hasn't been without many
bribes.  I don't know how I am going to get him to take his medicine 4X a
day for 10 days--popsicles, ice cream, etc. eventually get old.

We are waiting to see when/if we can fly to Texas later this summer.
However, I am hoping it is sooner than later.  Yesterday, we had to go to
the bookstore to "get some books for Texas" according to Jason.  I still
haven't unpacked the suitcases--it is too depressing to unpack bathing
suits, shorts, and sandals knowing I was almost there and facing the 50
degree weather here in Germany!!  People are wearing coats and turtle necks!

I hope everyone else is doing well.  We miss you guys!  I think we might
have to go to Colter's BBQ restaraunt this weekend and listen to country
music all weekend in honor of our missed Texas trip!

Love,
Tara

HEADLINE: Customers might have to pay SDG&E debt, advocate says

BYLINE: Craig D. Rose

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO

BODY:

Despite assurances from the governor and San Diego Gas & Electric, the
threat
to local ratepayers of paying most of a $750 million debt to the utility is
not
gone, a local consumer leader said yesterday.

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network,
said an agreement crafted by SDG&E and the governor to deal with the debt
might
avoid raising rates to pay it off but that it will take consumer money from
other pockets.

Gov. Gray Davis and SDG&E officials on Monday said their two-part plan would
eliminate the debt along with transferring ownership of the utility's
transmission system to the state for $1 billion.

Under the complex agreement, said Shames, ''It appears we will be paying 90
percent or more of the $750 million.''

SDG&E officials underscored that the debt, which they estimated might reach
as much as $400 per residential customer, would be removed without raising
rates.

The debt began building when the Legislature last fall capped local power
rates to contain the electricity crisis. But SDG&E still had to purchase power
at market prices higher than the capped rates collected from customers. The
utility's ''undercollection'' grew to about $750 million in a balancing
account
until California began buying power on behalf of the state's utility companies
in February.

Shames said the two-part deal announced by the governor is devoid of
significant concessions by the utility and pays far too much for its
transmission lines. This comes from the man who first suggested the state
purchase of transmission lines from financially troubled utilities as a
component of resolving the crisis caused by electricity deregulation.

''I could not find anything in there of benefit to consumers,'' he said.

In particular, Shames criticized the deal for crediting SDG&E with hundreds
of millions in profits from power sales to the state. The consumer leader said
these profits belong to ratepayers, a view that had been supported by the
California Public Utilities Commission.

Shames said further that SDG&E's payment of $100 million to settle claims
regarding its power purchasing practices allows the utility to avoid scrutiny
of
how it bought power during a six-month period at the height of the electricity
crisis.

It remains unclear, he said, whether the agreement will win its required
approval from the PUC.

''It depends on how independent the commission is,'' Shames said. ''If they
jump when the governor tells them to do something or if they maintain their
constitutionally mandated independence.''

The president of SDG&E yesterday reiterated his view that the agreements
involve concessions on the utility's behalf, including a contribution of $219
million in profits that SDG&E says were due its shareholders, not its
customers.

''We feel like we've done some great things for the customer here,'' said
Edwin Guiles, the utility company president. ''This is win-win situation for
our
customers, the state and for SDG&E.''

The FERC's Action Is Good, Bad,Ugly

BYLINE: PETER NAVARRO, Peter Navarro is an associate professor of economics
and
public, policy at UC Irvine. E-mail: pnavarro@uci.edu

BODY:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new wholesale price caps will
save
the Western states literally tens of billions of dollars in electricity bills.
As wonderful as that sounds, the FERC order still allows wholesale generators
to
extract enough windfall profits to drive the region into recession.

The FERC's approach may also perversely lead to more air pollution and
natural gas shortages.

Let's look at what the FERC did right. First, the order approved Monday
establishes price caps on a 24/7 basis rather than simply during power
emergencies--a long overdue reform.

Second, the order protects the entire West, not just California. This
regional cap will end "megawatt laundering," whereby in-state generators sold
power across California lines and then resold it back into the state to evade
caps.

Third, the order closes the ridiculous broker loophole that made the FERC's
previous price caps Swiss cheese. Before, generators could redirect their
sales
from the market to energy brokers who were exempt from the price caps.

So where did the FERC go wrong? The problem may be traced to the two
competing methods of imposing price caps and the all-important concept of
"economic rent."

Economic rent, in the wholesale electricity market, is the market price of
electricity minus the producer's cost, where cost includes not just labor and
fuel but a "fair profit" on the invested capital as well. In traditional
regulation, this fair profit is calculated very simply as the market cost of
the
money borrowed to build the power plant.

Under this definition, if the producer's cost is a nickel a kilowatt hour
and
he can sell it for 35 cents--as producers in the West have been doing--the
producer can extract 30 cents of economic rent from consumers.

In California, the extraction of such economic rent through market
manipulation has taken place on a grand-theft scale. In 1999, California's
electricity bill was about $7 billion. Last year, it was almost $30 billion
for
roughly the same amount of electricity. This year, California's bill is well
on
its way to $50 billion annually.

To stop this rip-off, Gov. Gray Davis proposed "cost-based" price caps. Such
caps are calculated on a plant-specific basis. Each generator is allowed to
recover its cost of production, including the fair profit, but not a penny
more.

Thus, for example, a newer, highly efficient plant generating power at a
nickel per kilowatt hour would collect a nickel. The oldest, least efficient
plant that generated power for 20 cents would be allowed to collect 20 cents.

By setting different prices for different plants, the economic rents are
driven to zero. Yet each generator still has a fair profit incentive to
produce.
From a public policy perspective, it's the best of all possible worlds. And it
was categorically rejected by the FERC. Instead, the FERC sets a single price
for all generators based on the cost of the "least efficient plant."

The obvious problem with this umbrella pricing rule is that it still allows
generators to extract billions in economic rent from consumers.

In our previous example, and under the FERC's rule, the least efficient
plant
still collects 20 cents a unit to recover costs. However, the most efficient
plant producing power at a nickel-per-kilowatt also collects 20 cents rather
than a nickel and thus extracts a full 15 cents of economic rent.

Thus, under the FERC's rule, wholesale generators still will be able to
capture tens of billions of dollars more from consumers and businesses than
under Davis' cost-based rule.

The FERC's approach is still subject to the same kind of strategic gaming
that has been the hallmark of this crisis. Generators will ensure that during
peak times, when the price cap is being established, the most expensive
possible
plant is in operation--whether it needs to be or not. This will peg the price
at
the highest level.

In addition, the FERC provides generators with a perverse incentive to run
their least efficient units more often. Since these least efficient plants are
also the highest polluting, the result will be dirtier air. Moreover, the
excessive running of these plants may also put a strain on already stretched
natural gas supplies. These least efficient plants use up to 40% more natural
gas to produce a unit of electricity.

The bottom line: The FERC "done good." But it could have done a lot better.
And the way things stand now, there still is a danger that higher electricity
costs could push California and the rest of the West--and eventually the
nation--into a nasty recession.

THE ENERGY CRISIS;
New Price Caps Not a Deterrent, Power Firms Say;
Regulation: Producers are unhappy with the federal action but say it is
unlikely
to discourage them from constructing new plants.

BYLINE: NANCY VOGEL, THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

BODY:

The expanded electricity price limits approved by federal regulators could
squeeze big energy traders but will probably not discourage power plant
construction in California, electricity producers said Tuesday.

Power plant owners and marketers said they had not had time to digest the
53-page order and thus could not say exactly how it would affect California
and
the 10 other Western states it covers.

But the companies generally asserted Tuesday that the order would not deter
them from investing in the vast, power-starved Western region--though they
have
often raised such a prospect in arguing against price controls.

Whatever its long-term effects, Monday's order by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission appeared to have an immediate effect in dampening prices
in California's volatile daily, or spot, market.

The order does not take effect until today, but the prospect of new measures
aimed at limiting prices appeared to tame markets Tuesday. Californians used
more electricity at the late-afternoon peak than on any day this year, yet
market prices hovered around $100 a megawatt-hour.

That is well below the average of $284 a megawatt-hour that the state paid
for electricity from January through April, with prices soaring as high as $
1,900 at times of tight supply.

"All the markets in the West have come down," said Mike Wilczek, senior
power
markets reporter for Platts, the energy market information division of the
McGraw-Hill Cos. "It's bearish news."

Nevertheless, several generators minimized the effects of the FERC order,
contradicting earlier warnings from some industry sources and officials of the
Bush administration who consider price limits to be impediments to future
investment in power plants.

"Calpine will have no problem operating under this order," said Joe Ronan,
vice president of regulatory affairs for San Jose-based Calpine Corp., which
has
three power plants under construction in California and plans to build at
least
three others.

The federal order lasts only until September 2002, he said, and because it
sets prices based on the cost of running the most expensive, inefficient power
plant in the market, it should guarantee the owners of modern plants a profit.

Another company planning major investments in California, Duke Energy Corp.
of North Carolina, said it will not be seriously affected by the federal order
because it has sold the output of its four California plants well into the
future.

"We've already forward-sold 90% of our generation for 2001 and 70% for
2002,"
company spokesman Pat Mullen said.

Reliant Energy Inc. of Houston, which owns five power plants in California,
was not so sanguine about the federal order, but it has not backed away from
plans to install more generators.

"We remain committed to California, as hard as it is to do business here
today," spokesman Richard Wheatley said. "We have plans that are on the
drawing
boards for at least one, possibly two projects."

On Monday, Reliant Chief Executive Joe Bob Perkins called the FERC action
"more of a political response" than an acknowledgment of the gap between
electricity supply and demand in California.

"Price caps don't work," Perkins said, and he warned California consumers
against assuming that the energy crisis is over simply because wholesale
electricity prices have recently dropped to their lowest levels in a year.

Prices are falling because of mild weather, not price controls, he said.

"Without sound economics that increase available supply and reduce peak
demand . . . consumers can only hope for favorable weather and look forward to
[rolling blackouts]," Perkins said.

Energy analyst Frederick Schultz of Raymond James & Associates in Houston
called the FERC order "a nonevent to the California generators" because so
much
of their power is now being sold through long-term contracts.

However, every long-term deal reduces the size of the electricity market,
which supplies about 20% of California's needs. And that, in turn, limits
trading opportunities for such firms as Enron Corp., which profit on the daily
market's ups and downs, Schultz said.

Enron representatives did not respond to calls for comment.

The federal order imposes round-the-clock price curbs on wholesale
electricity sold in 11 Western states that are connected by transmission
grids.

Under the order, traders say, market prices will probably hover around $100
a
megawatt-hour, depending upon the price of the natural gas that fuels most of
the state's electric generating plants. Though that is well below recent
market
prices, it is higher than the average of about $32 a megawatt-hour that
California utilities paid in 1999, before the state's deregulated market
spiraled out of control.

The FERC order dictates that the price for spot market electricity across
the
West will be based on the cost of producing one megawatt-hour of power at the
least-efficient plant selling to California grid operators. May 31, when a
previous FERC order based on a similar formula took effect, the price set was
$
127 a megawatt-hour.

THE ENERGY CRISIS;
Plan Won't Raise Rates, Davis Says;
Edison: Governor seeks to assure Senate, where Democrats say action is a
bailout
of nearly bankrupt utility.

BYLINE: CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Gov. Gray Davis sought to assure the state Senate on Tuesday that his plan
to
save Southern California Edison from threatened financial collapse would work
without increasing customer rates.

Davis sent assurances to the Senate Energy Committee through his top
attorney, Barry Goode, who helped negotiate the controversial proposal with
the
utility.

Senate Republicans have taken a wait-and-see attitude on the plan. But they
generally contend that the business of utilities belongs in the hands of
private
enterprise.

But Democrats in both houses have charged that the deal between Democrat
Davis and Edison represents a state bailout of the nearly bankrupt
Rosemead-based utility. The analysis is shared by leading consumer activists.

At the first in a series of Senate hearings on the package, which is
considered all but dead in its current form, Sen. Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto)
voiced concerns about political problems with the plan.

He asked Goode, who was flanked at a witness table by Edison executives,
whether monthly bills of the utility's customers would increase as a
consequence
of approval of the governor's package.

"Our models say there will be no additional impact on the ratepayers," Goode
replied.

Other members appeared ready to pursue rate increase questions, but
Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) cut them short. She said the issue
would be fully examined at a later hearing.

To spare Edison from going into bankruptcy and to restore its credit-
worthiness, Davis and executives of the utility reached a complex compromise
in
April, the centerpiece of which was a state purchase of Edison's transmission
grid for about $2.8 billion, more than twice its book value.

Edison has estimated that it owes $3.5 billion to creditors, including
wholesale power generators, as a result of deregulation of retail electricity
prices in 1996.

Because of a freeze in retail rates, Edison was prohibited from passing its
energy costs to customers.

Other features of the deal include dedicating a portion of consumer rates to
help pay off the debt, a guaranteed 11.6% rate of return to Edison on its
sales
and investments, and termination of an ongoing Public Utilities Commission
investigation into financial dealings of Edison's parent company, Edison
International.

The energy committee held the hearing for fact-finding purposes and did not
consider the Edison bill, SB 78x by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles).

But the Davis-Edison deal has angered consumer activists, who contended that
bankruptcy for Edison would be preferable.

They deplored it as a bailout that would cost Edison customers $5 billion to
$7 billion.

"If the Legislature makes the mistake of forcing the ratepayers of
California
to pay one more penny to bail out these companies, we will put [an initiative]
right on the ballot," said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation for Taxpayer
and
Consumer Rights.

Consumer organizations in 1998 put to the voters an initiative to junk the
1996 deregulation law. The measure failed.

Rosenfield, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union and Matt Freedman of the Utility
Reform Network all asserted at a news conference that the Davis rescue program
should be killed.

Snyder, who opposed deregulation, said the governor's bill is shaping up as
a
replay of 1996.

"It's too big, too complicated. . . . This is the same process that brought
about this [deregulation] disaster," Snyder said.

Separately, San Diego Gas & Electric agreed Monday to sell its transmission
grid to the state for about $1 billion on the same terms as Edison.

With all the controversy surrounding the Edison deal, the chance of SDG&E
winning legislative approval of its sale is slightly better than 50%, said
Stephen L. Baum, chief executive of Sempra Energy, parent of SDG&E.

"I think there's a widely shared view in the Legislature that they don't
want
the state in the long-term business of power procurement. . . . In order to
get
Edison back into that business there has to be this infusion of capital" to
pay
off past electricity debts and make the utility credit-worthy, Baum said.

France and California--Vive the Differences and Similarities

BYLINE: PATT MORRISON

BODY:

Did you happen to feel it? That sudden impulse to buy gas by the liter? A
furtive urge to smoke a foul, unfiltered cigarette? Did you wonder what was
going on?

I'll tell you what it was: California has burst out like Lance Armstrong
passing the pack in the fiscal Tour de France. The Bear Flag Republic, all by
itself, has overtaken La Belle France to become the Chanel No. 5 of the world
of
wealth, the fifth most powerful economic force du monde and gaining on Germany
and Japan and Mother England and the other 49 states put together. In sum, our
GDP now is bigger than their GDP.

But California is not Bismarck's Germany. So the Golden State was more
gilded
than Gaul by about 50 billion; it is not our style to grind the loser
ignominiously into the dust. We are more than a benevolent nation-state; we
are
the world. We bestowed Euro Disney on France, and allowed Marcel Marceau into
the country.

Differences? Bien sur. Californians cavort in the streets for a champion
basketball team; the French break out the confetti for poets.

The French get six weeks' vacation, your average Californian gets two. Maybe
that's why we are the world's cinquieme economic engine and France is sucking
our low-emission fumes. (The laid-back Californian was the malicious invention
of East Coast pundits. Farmers and movie stars, our rugged pioneer forebears,
both start work at the crack of dawn.)

France gets its electricity from nuclear power, we get ours from Texas'
power.

California was glad to let nuclear bombs be tested in Nevada, home of a fake
Eiffel Tower; France tries out its nuclear arsenal in the South Pacific, far
from the real Eiffel Tower.

The French very sensibly take their dogs to restaurants and leave their
children at home. Californians, regrettably, do it the other way around.

France is pretty creeped out by Scientology. Here it's the state religion of
Hollywood.

The French revere their language. We treat ours like Silly Putty.

Hollywood grinds out the entertainment that makes the French intelligentsia
scream about cultural imperialism (even as your average Jean eats it up). Last
week, Sumner Redstone, that ubermaster of Viacom, Paramount, MTV, UPN and half
the known entertainment world, told me with breezy contempt, "People all over
the world . . . they want American movies. They don't want French movies."

In France you can get red wine at McDonald's. Until recently, in Orange
County you couldn't order red wine at the Performing Arts Center lest you
spilled it on the white carpets. (The vines that made Los Angeles a winemaking
powerhouse in the 19th century were imported by a French immigrant named
Vignes.)

France preens itself on the Concorde. California birthed the Stealth bomber.
Paris has the Jeu de Paume museum, and a museum of locks. Los Angeles has
MOCA,
and a bra museum.

A French company named Vivendi makes movies at Universal. A California
company named Kaufman and Broad builds suburbs in France.

The French believe in public transit. Californians believe in the sanctity
of
one-man, one-car. L.A. is considering hiring a French firm to build its bus
shelters. During Los Angeles' transit strike, Mayor Riordan set a good example
by bicycling--except that he did it in France.

And yet we look in the mirror and see something of each other. California
goes its own stubborn way in the U.S. just as France charts its own wayward
course in Europe.

Parisians feel kinship with San Franciscans; both have miserable summer
weather. Southern California is more south-of-France-friendly; Cannes and
Beverly Hills are sister cities.

California and France are the makers of fashion and food style. Maitres
Splichal and Puck trained in the best kitchens in France; Alice Waters, the
mother of California cuisine, was invited to open a restaurant near the sacred
precincts of the Louvre.

France and California both have moderate-minded Roman Catholic cardinals
named Roger. Marie Antoinette, important Frenchwoman, lost her head to the
mob.
Rose Bird, important California woman, had her head handed to her by voters.

So rest easy, France. We may have passed you, but we won't forget you. We
are
too much alike.

Charles DeGaulle observed pungently that "Only peril can bring the French
together. One can't impose unity out of the blue on a country that has 265
different kinds of cheese."

Gray Davis, governor of a nation-state with a hundred different kinds of
athletic shoes, united only by perils natural and man-made, would understand
perfectly.

HEADLINE: State to Pay Electric Bill With Loan, Not Taxes

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

California taxpayers, who have had to bankroll billions of dollars in
electricity purchases for the teetering power utilities, will soon no longer
see
their money evaporate at record rates, under an executive order by Gov. Gray
Davis.

As early as next week, the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the state
budget by allowing Treasurer Phil Angelides to borrow $5 billion to buy
electricity. That money is expected to cover power purchases until this fall,
when the state plans to sell an unprecedented $12.5 billion in bonds to repay
the general tax fund and buy future electricity.

Angelides said Tuesday that he has already lined up $3.5 billion in loans
from two Wall Street firms, and expects to secure at least another billion by
next week, when he plans to close the deal and obtain the money.

The loan is critical, he said, because without it, electricity purchases
would completely deplete state coffers as early as October.

"In essence, it stops the general-fund bleeding," Angelides said. "What this
interim financing does is take the pressure off the general fund and,
hopefully,
avert a cash crisis."

The loan could also ease concerns on Wall Street that California's risky
entry into the power business has placed the state budget in a precarious
position. Those concerns were one of the main reasons two major credit rating
agencies downgraded the state earlier this year.

"We have been looking forward to this day," said Ray Murphy, a vice
president
at Moody's Investors Service, one of the two firms that downgraded
California's
credit rating. "We view this as a positive first step toward getting the state
out of the power business. We wanted the state to get the general fund out of
the business as quickly as possible."

California has allocated $8.2 billion in taxpayer money for electricity
since
January because the state's private utilities became too saddled with debt to
continue purchasing power on the open market. and massive blackouts loomed.

Under a plan devised by Davis and approved by the Legislature, the state
budget is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with the bond
issue,
the largest in American history. The bonds, in turn, are to be paid off by
utility ratepayers through their monthly bills.

The bond issue, however, has been delayed by partisan politics and complex
legal issues raised by the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the
state's
largest private utility.

A bond sale initially planned for May is now scheduled for late September,
according to Angelides' latest estimate. The state's Public Utilities
Commission
still needs to take a number of technical actions before the sale can take
place.

As a result, the state budget has been drained for power purchases far
longer
than initially anticipated--a situation that has imperiled spending on
education, transportation and other critical needs, at least temporarily.

Angelides had earlier sought to secure a $4-billion bridge loan to repay the
state budget for power purchases until the bonds were sold, but was rebuffed
by
Republicans in the Legislature, who argued that the loan was not necessary.

Davis' executive order, issued late Monday as part of the Democratic
governor's emergency powers during the energy crisis, gives Angelides the
authority to press ahead.

But it does not allow the treasurer to use the loan to repay the budget for
the billions spent so far this year on electricity, as he had originally
intended. Rather, it permits Angelides to use the loan proceeds to assist the
Department of Water Resources, the state agency buying power, with its future
electricity expenses.

If the bond issue is further delayed, Angelides estimated, the loan would
gives California another four to six months before it would begin to run out
of
money. Furthermore, the loan closes a potential loophole that existed in the
long-term contracts Davis had signed to stabilize the cost of electricity,
which
would have let power suppliers walk away from the deals if the state had not
secured a source of financing by next month.

But Republicans warned that by entering into a bridge loan deal without
knowing when the bonds would be sold, Davis and the Democrats were incurring
major risks that could further drive up the price tag of the crisis.

The loan carries a blended interest rate of about 4.5%, but if it is not
repaid by Oct. 31, the rate jumps to 7%. Because the loan is to be repaid by
the
bonds, which have been marred by a history of delay, GOP officials Tuesday
were
already calling the bridge loan a "bridge to nowhere."

"The thing that is most troubling is that the governor did not bother to
consult with anyone," said Assembly Republican leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks),
who learned of Davis' order from reporters. "It's disappointing, but the
governor does not seem to recognize there is a legislative branch."

HEADLINE: THE ENERGY CRISIS;
;
FERC Move Short-Circuits Push for Hard Price Caps

BYLINE: RICHARD T. COOPER, JANET HOOK, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision to impose full-time
price
ceilings on wholesale electricity in California and the West appears to have
deflated the congressional drive for a return to traditional utility
regulation.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), calling the "price mitigation" system FERC
unveiled Monday "a giant step forward," announced Tuesday that she is pulling
back her bill to force a return to the "cost of service" pricing system that
prevailed before deregulation. Republican Sen. Gordon Smith of Oregon, a
co-sponsor, agreed, as did Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of the Senate
Energy Committee.

House Democrats vowed to fight on for tougher controls, but they were given
little chance to succeed.

As a result, although the political blame game will rage on, the reality of
a
long, ugly summer for California appears to have arrived: at least several
months of tears, toil, sweat--and fast-rising electric bills.

California consumers are likely to face an unpleasant paradox, energy
analysts said: Given present power shortages, blackouts are virtually
inevitable
this summer. And, since state authorities are beginning to let high wholesale
prices flow through into retail bills after months of subsidies, many
consumers
could face higher charges at the same time their lights begin to flicker.

Even if FERC's order succeeds and wholesale prices fall, as they have begun
to do in recent weeks, consumers' bills are likely to rise. Since retail
charges
lag well behind wholesale prices, closing the gap will probably mean a period
of
higher costs for consumers, regardless of what happens in wholesale markets.

There is light at the end of the tunnel, energy analysts said, but it is
probably a year away. And reaching it, they said, depends in part on
government
officials taking no action that might spook investors and disrupt present
plans
for expanding the region's capacity to generate and deliver more power.

The new FERC system, which its designers said would provide temporary price
relief while preserving incentives for energy investment, imposes cost-based
curbs on wholesale prices throughout the West and covers all such sales, not
just those during periods of extreme shortages, as did the order issued in
April.

FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. told the committee the new system will
prevent "megawatt laundering" and other potential abuses. He said his agency
is
"committed to ferreting out any forms of market misbehavior 24 hours a day,
seven days a week."

With the apparent collapse of demands for more intervention, Congress now
seems ready to give FERC a year or more of leeway to see whether its plan will
curb wholesale prices and create what FERC member Linda Breathitt, a Democrat,
called "a breathing spell" in which California and the West can "repair their
dysfunctional markets."

"It still remains to be seen whether there can be manipulation, but I think
we should wait and see," Feinstein said Tuesday at a Senate Energy Committee
meeting attended by all five FERC members. The commissioners call their new
system "price mitigation," not price caps, but Feinstein said it amounts to
the
same thing.

"Whether you call it price mitigation or something else, a rose is a rose is
a rose," said Feinstein, a member of the energy committee.

And Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), appearing before the committee as a
witness, said: "I was very pleased with [Monday's] about-face by FERC. I
believe
they have a new tone."

Democrats on the other side of the Capitol pledged to keep fighting for
traditional regulation, but with Republicans in control of the House, the
struggle appears to be largely symbolic.

House Democrats wanted to introduce amendments on price controls and other
energy policy to a mid-year supplemental appropriation bill due to come before
the House today. However, GOP leaders expected to block Democrats from even
offering the amendments on procedural grounds.

The most sweeping of the amendments would set cost-based limits on wholesale
energy prices in the West. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and other
sponsors insisted that the measure is still needed in spite of the FERC
action,
which he said would continue to provide windfall profits to generators,
encourage suppliers to withhold power and do too little to restrain the price
of
natural gas.

He called the FERC policy an "experiment" that is using California and other
Western states as subjects.

Similarly, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said: "Although the FERC
decision [Monday] is a step in the right direction, I am concerned it does not
remove incentives for energy suppliers to withhold power, drive up prices and
gouge consumers."

The commission went as far as it did in part because of the specter of
broader price control legislation, Pelosi said. "They felt the heat, they saw
the amendments coming and decided to act."

And Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), in an interview Tuesday, said he will
press ahead with legislation to impose hard price caps. "I would advise the
senators that after a year of dealing with these price gougers that they will
easily manipulate this latest order," he said, calling it a "Swiss cheese
order--full of holes."

Feinstein's shift put House Democrats in an awkward political position
because it came just as they prepared to make their big push for tougher
controls. But the Democrats tried to minimize the differences in legislative
strategy.

"She too is waiting to see if the FERC experiment works," Waxman said. "I'm
a
little more skeptical, but we're both watching carefully."

As a political matter, a Democratic leadership aide acknowledged, the FERC
order muddies the debate at a time when Democrats have been working hard to
make
it a defining issue--and one they had hoped would help them win control of the
House in the 2002 elections.

"It's hard to describe to people what the difference is between what we want
and what FERC has done," said the aide.

And Republicans said FERC's action had clearly taken the wind out of the
sails of price control efforts that some GOP strategists feared might have
passed the House.

"I would have thought [it would pass] last week," said John Feehery,
spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). "But now, with what
FERC
did, it takes a lot of air out of the balloon."

"I think the FERC action will dissipate that strong push," agreed Emily
Miller, a spokeswoman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas). "It will
take
the heat off."

House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said the message to Democrats
was,
"It's time to come off your political high horse."

He said he wanted to keep Democrats from offering their price control
amendment to Wednesday's supplemental appropriation bill because the proposal
is
"a political statement, not a policy statement."

Energy on Agenda, but Issue Is Blame;
Politics: Gov. Davis will try to sway voter anger toward the GOP as he faces a
Senate panel.

BYLINE: RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

BODY:

When California Gov. Gray Davis testifies at a high-profile Senate hearing
today, the issue formally on the table will be the expanded electricity price
controls that federal regulators approved this week. But the session's
political
subtext will be the escalating struggle between Davis and national Republicans
to determine where California voters look for solutions--and blame--for the
state's power woes.

In both California and Washington, Republican strategists believe Davis is
trying to manufacture a succession of conflicts with the White House that will
allow him to run in 2002 as much against President Bush as against whomever
the
state GOP nominates in the gubernatorial race. In return, Republicans are
trying
to shift the focus back toward Davis--most aggressively through a
California-wide television advertising campaign organized by Scott Reed, a
former executive director of the Republican National Committee.

"Our goal is to get the focus back to Sacramento, where it belongs," Reed
said.

Both sides see the same prize in this tug of war: the opportunity to
determine where most Californians direct their anger during what could be a
long, hot summer of power shortages.

"The situation is that the public's minds are not made up on this
issue--whether it is Sacramento or Washington who has acted too little, too
late," said Mark Baldassare, a pollster at the independent Public Policy
Institute of California. "That gives both sides an opportunity to get their
messages out. The stakes are fairly high in terms of how the public in
California ends up assessing blame over the next few months."

A Slight Uptick in Davis' Popularity

Overall, Davis' political situation appears to be stabilizing. After months
of runaway power costs, the prices the state pays for wholesale electricity
are
falling and new plants will come online next month. And following a free fall
in
private polls, Davis has seen his numbers tick back up slightly. Similarly, a
poll financed by independent power generators showed that in mid-June, for the
first time in months, Californians were becoming slightly more confident that
the crisis is easing.

Within the state Capitol, Davis is asserting himself, demanding that
lawmakers hold hearings on his rescue plan for Southern California Edison. On
Monday, he released details of a similar plan for San Diego Gas & Electric.
Last
week, he announced an agreement that is likely to increase generation by
alternative energy producers, who account for about a fourth of the state's
supply.

"This guy is changing," said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who a few
months back had been urging that Davis take a more aggressive stance on the
crisis. "There is a difference in his demeanor and focus."

Yet the energy crisis still looms as a vast cloud over a reelection campaign
that once looked like a stroll on the beach.

The paradox for Davis is that the substantive victory for price-control
advocates at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting this week may
complicate his political goal of maintaining a heavy focus on Washington.
Though
Davis and some congressional Democrats portrayed FERC's decision as
insufficient, it appears to have lanced the pressure for federal legislation
to
impose the tighter price controls that Davis supports.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a principal sponsor of that bill, on
Tuesday announced she would shelve the measure for six months to give the new
FERC plan time to work.

As a result, the political effect of the FERC ruling could be to shift the
focus away from Washington back toward decisions in Sacramento, which is
exactly
what Republicans prefer. "Gray Davis is the dog that finally caught the car,"
said Dan Schnur, a San Francisco-based GOP consultant. "Davis is going to keep
screaming about price caps and refunds, but now Republicans can point to
substantive action."

Davis: 'Much More They Should Do'

For months, Davis has criticized Bush for refusing to support electricity
price controls and other measures that the governor says could ease
California's
energy crunch. At almost every opportunity, Davis offers the same message:
California is taking the steps it needs to, but Washington has failed to help
enough. That was precisely Davis' message Monday when FERC significantly
expanded the limited price caps it had imposed previously.

While saying that FERC had "finally taken a step in the right direction,"
Davis added: "There is much more they should do"--including providing refunds
to
California for alleged overcharges. The overall tone of Davis' statement was
much more skeptical about FERC's action than the remarks from Feinstein, who
described the decision as "a giant step forward."

Aides say Davis plans to repeat that two-part message in his appearance
today
before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.). In his testimony, and in a round of scheduled television
appearances, Davis will demand that FERC order refunds in the range of $5
billion to $6 billion to the state, aides said. Davis also will distribute to
every member of Congress a 177-page book chronicling the state's response to
the
crisis.

Inside the Bush White House, some officials see in Davis' cool response to
FERC's decision more evidence that the governor is determined to use the White
House as a foil in his reelection campaign. The prevailing view, one official
said, is that, no matter what concessions the administration offers, Davis
will
immediately raise the bar and demand something else--the way he did by talking
about rebates as soon as FERC offered tougher price controls.

"That is Davis' M.O.," said one official involved in the White House's
energy
strategy. "He asks the administration to do something, the administration does
it, and then he attacks the administration for not doing enough. . . . He
needs
someone to blame."

Davis aides reject that characterization, arguing that the governor is
merely
representing the state's interests against an administration that they
maintain
is favoring energy producers over consumers. But Davis advisors acknowledge
that
they have used focus groups to test campaign messages that pin the blame for
the
energy crunch primarily on Davis' Republican predecessor, Pete Wilson, and a
"Republican president who has failed to stop his rich friends in the energy
industry" from gouging consumers, one aide said.

"You don't have to tell people in focus groups more than once how this is
connected," the Davis aide said.

Gubernatorial Rivals Are Free of Blame

Baldassare, the independent pollster, notes it may be especially imperative
for Davis to keep Bush's energy decisions in the spotlight because none of his
potential Republican opponents in 2002--California Secretary of State Bill
Jones, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan or businessman William E.
Simon
Jr.--is easily tagged with complicity in the problem. "None of them were
really
involved in the decision-making over deregulation," Baldassare said. "The only
one else to blame, in a political sense, is Washington and the Bush
administration."

The new independent advertising campaign against Davis was inspired largely
by the fear of that strategy succeeding--damaging the standing in California
not
only of Bush but also of other Republicans, particularly those in Congress.
Reed, whose American Taxpayers Alliance is funding the ads, said he decided to
launch the campaign after Davis appeared to gain the upper hand in the media
debate following Bush's visit to California late last month.

"The Bush trip really changed the terms of debate about Davis' problem and
made it more of a possible national Republican problem," Reed said. "The
entire
terms of debate turned around and was focused on the issue of price caps as
opposed to negligence on Davis' behalf. Our group is attempting to go out and
engage Davis."

To "engage" Davis, Reed's group, which has not revealed its donors, is
spending what he said would be $1.5 million on an initial ad criticizing Davis
this week, though a spot check of TV stations around the state indicated a far
more modest buy. Reed said the group is planning to air a new ad as soon as
this
week.

Democrats plan to answer the ads with attacks of their own and will be
filing
complaints with the IRS and other federal agencies about the anonymous funding
of the Reed ad.

Today's Senate hearing will give Davis another chance to respond to the GOP
and make his case for greater help from Washington. But Lieberman aides
acknowledge the hearing is likely to be much less confrontational than it
would
have been if FERC had not acted Monday. The agency's decision "changed the
dynamic," the aide said.

That assessment may apply not only to the conflict between FERC and its
critics but also equally to the hostilities between Davis and the White House.

Blackout Forecasts' Dark Side;
* If optimists are wrong and the power runs out, California's energy crisis
could quickly cost lives and cripple the economy.

BYLINE: JENIFER WARREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

It's here. Summer 2001, the blackout season, is only a day away.

Already Californians anticipate power outages when temperatures rise. By
August, the occasional annoyances endured so far--stoplights gone dark,
computers, air conditioners and elevators idled--could seem almost quaint.

Gov. Gray Davis insists we needn't worry. Four large new power plants are
firing up soon, he said, and government's best and brightest are locking up
still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need. Californians, Davis
predicts, will valiantly heed his call to conserve, helping the state survive
the hot months, no sweat.

With luck, he'll be right. Power prices have stabilized, and some energy
analysts are wondering whether California may have tamed the blackout beast.

But what if those plants don't get built in time, people don't trim their
electricity use 7% and energy imports are more meager than expected?

And what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot, as
Davis bets, but blistering, record-setting hot?

Government experts who ponder such questions don't expect disaster in the
coming months. But they are planning for it nonetheless.

At best, they say, Californians can expect some gridlocked intersections, an
occasionally overloaded 911 system, perhaps some business bankruptcies,
certainly inconvenience. At worst, the Western power grid could crash, causing
uncontrolled blackouts that might lead to looting, contaminated water
supplies,
even civil unrest.

"How bad could this summer get?" said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana).
"This summer could be the worst disaster to ever hit the state of California."

Imagine it's a Thursday morning in the third week of July. Relentless heat
grips California, the curse of a stubborn high-pressure ridge that just won't
budge.

As air conditioners from Redding to Chula Vista lumber to life, managers of
the state's power grid in Folsom gulp their third and fourth cups of coffee,
stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret.

Demand is jumping. Supply is static, Canada and Arizona have nothing to
sell.
It's looking tight.

Thirty minutes later, the picture is gloomier. A brush fire shuts down
transmission lines near Fresno, squeezing supply in the Central Valley. In the
Bay Area, the unusual heat drives demand well past projections.

By noon things look bleak. Operators of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power
plant
near San Luis Obispo have cut output by 80%. The trouble? Chunks of kelp have
lodged in one of the plant's seawater intake valves, creating a clog like one
that plagued the facility in January.

With a chorus of groans, the grid's keepers scour the market for power to
offset the Diablo loss. No luck. As the mercury climbs and the Golden State
economy roars into full swing, electricity consumption ticks upward, minute by
minute. And when managers of a power plant near Long Beach cut output because
of
a cracked turbine, everyone knows what it means.

Alert the utilities. It's lights out, California, for the fourth day in a
row.

Dr. J. Michael Leary dreads blackouts--not personally, but professionally.
Leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of Rancho Mirage. When
air conditioners go on the blink there, the victims--scores of them, mostly
old
folks--wind up in his ER.

In a normal year, 75% of his emergency patients are geriatrics. Like
infants,
the elderly are unusually vulnerable to the heat. When blackouts hit, they are
most at risk.

"It's as if you lived in Maine and they turned the heat off in January,"
Leary said. "This is an extreme environment we live in. The effects can be
devastating."

Many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes, some of
them poorly insulated boxes that turn into ovens under the brutal summer sun.
Take away the air conditioning and the humans inside start baking, quick.

For Leary, the specter of continual, back-to-back blackouts in July--and,
some predict, in June and August too--conjures images of an 82-year-old man,
living alone in one of those mobile homes, taking medication for heart
disease.
The cardiovascular drugs plague the man with numerous side effects; one
inhibits
his body's ability to cool itself.

When a person gets overheated, body temperature eventually rises
uncontrollably. Then comes a nasty spiral of effects, and pretty soon "you go
into shock," Leary said. "Everything just shuts down."

On average each year, 371 Americans die from heat-related causes, more than
the number killed by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning and floods
combined. In 1995, a record hot spell in Chicago killed 465 people. Eleven
Californians died from the heat in 1998.

A new report by the United Seniors Assn. predicts that more than half a
million elderly Californians could need hospitalization for heat-related
ailments this summer.

Some communities have laid plans for cooling shelters, wading pools and
other
measures to provide relief. But will all who need help get it? Or get it in
time?

Out in the desert, paramedics expect a crush of 911 calls when the power
goes
out and the ill, frail and frightened seek help. Leary and others at
Eisenhower
Medical Center will be waiting, armed with ice packs, cooled IVs and
ventilators.

"I am very, very worried," the doctor said. "I think we'll see a great toll
in human suffering, even mortality."

California's tomato processors are no less anxious. They wash, cook, peel,
chop, mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from July to
October--enough to account for half the world's supply. For them, a string of
unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days.

The reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processing--a sterile system
instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plant's precise temperature
is
disturbed.

Once a batch of tomatoes is tainted, it must be thrown out--all 50,000
pounds. The plant must then be sanitized, a painstaking process that takes
about
36 hours.

"If you get hit by blackouts every third day for, say, two weeks, you're
starting, stopping, cleaning, restarting--it's a nightmare," said Jeff Boese,
president of the California League of Food Processors. "You could lose three
batches and be out $40 million before you knew what hit you."

Meanwhile, farmers with still more truckloads of tomatoes line up outside
the
plant, waiting to be paid for their crop: "If we can't process them, the
farmers
have spent an entire season growing them for nothing," Boese said.

In Sonoma County, the object in peril is the chicken. Egg producers equip
their laying houses with fans and swamp coolers to keep the hens comfortable.
Power is also needed to run giant refrigerators filled with eggs.

"In a blackout, those hens can overheat in no time," said Rich Matteis of
the
Pacific Egg and Poultry Assn. "In 20 or 30 minutes, you could have 100,000
birds
die."

Many large producers have backup generators, but they are not designed for
ongoing, intensive use. Will they hold up? Small-scale egg producers often
have
no backup power at all.

Hundreds of other California businesses could suffer if summer shapes up as
bad as some predict.

The Valero Refining Co. of California, northeast of San Francisco, produces
115,000 barrels of gasoline a day. Because restarting a refinery is a
complicated task, two or three blackouts close together could prompt officials
to shutter it until electricity supplies stabilize--costing California about
10%
of its gasoline supply.

At a Berkeley medical laboratory, doctors say power losses to their freezers
could destroy bone marrow needed to give young leukemia patients lifesaving
transplants. The state's 400 dialysis centers, where patients without kidney
function go to have their blood cleansed every other day, are in the same fix.
Few have backup generators, so when an outage hits, technicians must crank the
machines by hand.

Most Californians, of course, face far more ordinary consequences. The
scoreboards will fizzle at summer softball games, joggers on treadmills will
be
stopped in their tracks, electric organs will go silent, leaving choirs to
sing
without accompaniment.

Parents will be asked to retrieve children from day-care centers when the
lights and cooling systems conk out. Anniversary lunches may be ruined when
restaurants cannot grill salmon or blend margaritas.

Most people will tolerate occasional disturbances, psychologists say, doing
their part in a time of crisis. But what if such irritations become an
everyday
fact of life?

Hundreds of "essential" energy users--including prisons, fire departments
and
airports--are protected from blackouts, and hundreds more have applied for
exemptions. That means the pool of people bearing the blackout burden is
shrinking, so more frequent outages are likely.

Blackout predictions vary widely, but at least one forecaster, a consultant
for California water districts, anticipates an outage almost every afternoon
of
every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm.

Californians are accustomed to trash compactors, giant-screen TVs and having
the Internet at their fingertips. How much deprivation will they tolerate?

"So far, the version of blackouts we've experienced hasn't looked too scary
to people--it happens on a workday, in the afternoon, and you basically have
to
come home and reset your VCR," said Dan Kammen, a professor of energy and
society at UC Berkeley.

But if outages become daily events, and start to invade the evening hours,
the public mood could change abruptly.

"When there's a disaster or crisis or trauma, people tend to act heroically
and work together," said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles psychologist and
trauma specialist. "But the civilized behavior only lasts a short period. Then
people start acting in unpredictable ways."

That tendency may be exacerbated, Butterworth said, by the nature of the
energy crisis--not a natural disaster, but a man-made one.

"People start to look for a scapegoat," he said. "People will look for a
target, and there's a tendency to strike out at whoever is closest to you."

One place that tendency may surface, Butterworth said, is on traffic-clogged
roads. Blackouts already have led to scores of accidents. Add summer heat to
the
mix, and repeat the pattern day after day at rush hour, and motorists'
patience
could wear thin, law enforcement officials say.

"We're bracing for . . . possible acts of violence and road rage," said
Sacramento County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Saunders.

Lon House is the water consultant who predicts California could see
blackouts
almost every summer weekday. Among the worries for the 440 water agencies he
represents: losing the ability to pump water during wildfire season.

"I'm telling them to be ready for a major earthquake every day this
summer--meaning all your power is out throughout your district for multiple
hours," House said.

House insists he isn't an alarmist. But on top of the fire fears, he warns
that blackouts of more than a few hours would allow air into water pipes,
contaminating supplies. If that happens, Californians would be urged to boil
their water until the system can be disinfected from one end of the pipe to
the
other.

Though rolling blackouts are risky, they remain essentially a controlled
phenomenon, occurring when and where the grid managers and utilities decide.
Far
more frightening--and devastating--are unexpected, cascading outages that
could
shut down the entire Western power grid. It happened in August 1996, leaving 4
million people without power during a triple-digit heat wave.

The problem began when power lines in Oregon sagged into trees and shut
themselves off. That triggered a chain reaction of automatic switch-offs and
oscillating surges of energy that ultimately shut down all four of the main
power arteries between California and the Pacific Northwest.

That robbed the system of thousands of megawatts--enough to power four
cities
the size of Seattle for four days--and scattered outages across California and
six other Western states. Thousands of customers were without power for more
than a day.

Though such an episode is rare, California grid managers say it is more
likely today because the system is taxed by the ever-increasing load of
electricity it bears.

"The system is very dynamic, and when it's heavily loaded and highly
stressed, like it is now, the smallest little thing could cause big trouble,"
said Kevin Bakker, who oversees California's connection to the greater Western
power grid.

If a massive, uncontrolled outage should hit, the ramifications could be
dizzying, said Mike Guerin, chief of law enforcement for the state Office of
Emergency Services. Police departments would probably go to tactical alert,
guarding against looting by criminals who might take advantage of disabled
alarm
systems and darkened street lights.

In hot areas, cities might convert municipal buses--parked with air
conditioners running--into cooling shelters, Guerin said. The state would
provide emergency generators to nursing homes and others in need, while the
California National Guard might be called into action.

"With this kind of blackout scenario, you're not worried about the bologna
going bad in the refrigerator," Guerin said. "We're talking about doctors
doing
surgeries on backup generators for three days. We're talking about a lot of
things we don't like to think about."

Weather an early test for fee caps: Any severe jump in prices will likely be
curbed, experts say.
By Dale Kasler
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 20, 2001)
California electricity prices have shot back up recently, potentially posing
an early test of a new federal price-control plan that takes effect today.
Warm weather has sent wholesale prices doubling this week, partially
reversing a dramatic slide that had some state officials believing they'd
tamed the wildly unpredictable California electricity market.
The rebound in prices "would be expected," said Arthur O'Donnell, editor of
the California Energy Markets newsletter. "It's 110 degrees in Phoenix, and
it's 100 degrees (in Sacramento) and points in between."
Prices this week moved back above $100 a megawatt hour, about double what
they were last week -- although well below the roughly $300 suppliers were
charging California in mid-May. Prices showed signs of stabilizing Tuesday,
analysts said.
Experts said the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's new price-mitigation
plan is likely to curb the most severe price spikes. "This will eliminate the
astronomical prices," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of
California Energy Institute.
But the plan probably won't bring California a cascade of cheap power,
either.
Prices likely will bump up constantly against FERC's new price caps, which
will fluctuate from time to time, and they're not likely to go much below the
caps unless there's a significant glut of energy, said Peter Stiffler of the
energy consulting firm Economic Insight Inc.
"Traders will always trade in at the price ceiling," Stiffler said. "They're
going to offer power at the highest price they can."
The fluctuating FERC caps are tied to the production costs of the
least-efficient, most-expensive generating plant operating in California when
supplies are tight and an official "power alert" is declared by the state's
Independent System Operator, which runs most of the power grid. When there
isn't a power alert, prices can't exceed 85 percent of the price established
during the most recent alert.
FERC said the system would begin today with a cap of $108.49 a megawatt hour
but would rise to $127.64 if a power alert is declared.
But the cap can fluctuate significantly. Under the old FERC plan, the price
cap in May was set at $267 a megawatt hour. The old plan was similar to the
new system but applied only to California and only kicked in during power
alerts.
With the caps flexible, generators could have incentives to withhold power at
some plants in order to raise the caps, said Stanford University economist
Frank Wolak.
The FERC plan "still doesn't solve the problem of withholding," said Wolak,
chairman of the ISO's market surveillance committee.
Wolak also said he's afraid FERC will let power generators exaggerate their
costs in order to bump up the caps.
"The good news is, they seem to be more serious," Wolak said of the
oft-criticized commissioners. "But given how many times we've been taken in,
I'm wary."
In addition, generators will be allowed to exceed the price caps if they can
justify it to FERC officials. Borenstein said FERC in the past has allowed
generators to justify just about every price level imaginable, and he's
suspicious that the commission will let generators do the same in order to
evade the new price controls.
State officials, while cautiously optimistic about the plan, were upset that
FERC will allow a 10 percent price premium on electricity because of the risk
of selling to the California market.
"We recognize that the risk of nonpayment in California continues to be
greater" than in other states, the commission said in its written opinion,
released late Tuesday.
Gov. Gray Davis' spokesman, Steve Maviglio, called the premium ludicrous
because the state Department of Water Resources has been buying electricity
ever since the state's troubled utilities exhausted their credit in
mid-January.
"The state is as creditworthy a buyer as you can get," Maviglio said.
Experts said the plan also won't correct the state's energy imbalance.
"None of this is going to have much effect on blackouts," Borenstein said.
"This is solving part of the problem; I'm worried people will think
everything has been solved.
"The emphasis now has to be on getting California to conserve," he added.
A spokesman for power generators, Gary Ackerman, said the price controls
could worsen shortages this summer and will discourage generating firms from
investing in the new power plants the West desperately needs.
Builders "are going to sit on the fence and think about this," said Ackerman,
head of the Western Power Trading Forum.
Acting in the face of mounting political pressure and unrelenting criticism
from California, FERC voted Monday to impose round-the-clock price controls
throughout the 11-state Western region.
The FERC plan replaces a three-week-old plan that applied only to California
and took effect only when power reserves fell to below 7 percent of demand
and an official "power alert" was declared.
By extending the plan to the entire West, experts said the commission
probably put an end to the phenomenon known as "megawatt laundering," in
which power was shipped out of California and then re-imported. Imported
power wasn't subject to the old price controls.
The new controls, said consultant Stiffler, "significantly narrow the ability
of a trader to move power around and play the market."

State to borrow up to $5 billion to buy energy
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 20, 2001)
State Treasurer Phil Angelides announced Tuesday that he will borrow up to $5
billion to pay for future power purchases, a move he said was necessary to
avoid a continued drain on California's budget and cuts in other state
programs.
Since mid-January, energy purchased by the state Department of Water
Resources on the spot market and under long-term contracts has come out of
the state's general fund, the source of most state spending.
Once the loan becomes final by the end of next week, however, energy will be
purchased with the proceeds.
Made possible by an emergency order from the governor, the loan ultimately
will be paid off by customers of the state's investor-owned utilities through
their electricity rates.
"In essence, it stops the general fund bleeding," Angelides said.
The state has so far committed $8.2 billion from the general fund to
electricity purchases. Of that amount, Angelides said the Department of Water
Resources has actually spent about $6.1 billion through June 12 on power
purchases, and has received about $900 million back from customers'
electricity rates.
Officials expect the loan to finance power purchases through September, when
they plan to issue up to $13.4 billion in revenue bonds.
The bonds will reimburse the general fund and and pay off the loan.
"This gives the state some more running room, some more cushion in case
anything goes awry with the bond sale to make sure ... the state does not run
out of general fund money, jeopardizing education programs, law enforcement
programs, children's and health services," the Democratic treasurer said.
Angelides said he has obtained firm commitments for $3.5 billion from JP
Morgan and Lehman Brothers at a blended interest rate of about 4.5 percent.
If the long-term bonds are not issued by Oct. 31, the interest rate would
climb to about 7 percent.
Lawmakers initially had hoped to close the short-term loan in May and float
the long-term bonds shortly thereafter. However, Republicans in the state
Legislature balked at the plan, forcing the delay of the bond sale until
mid-August.
Rather than wait, Gov. Gray Davis invoked his emergency powers to allow for
the loan and circumvent the delay.
Assembly Republicans don't mind that the governor used his emergency powers
to expedite the loan, said James Fisfis, a spokesman for the caucus. Instead,
he said, they're concerned the loan could backfire and hurt Californians.
"If the larger bond offering falls through, the penalties and added interest
could add up on ratepayers' bills," he said.
But Angelides argued that the loan would benefit ratepayers on several
fronts: Power generators can no longer argue the state should pay a "credit
premium" on electricity, he said, and for the most part will not be able to
walk away from long-term energy contracts that have provisions requiring the
Department of Water Resources to obtain external financing by July 1.
Outside the Legislature, the announcement drew praise from financial analysts
who had criticized the state for buying power with taxpayer money.
In late April, for instance, Standard & Poor cited fears over the state's
mounting power costs when it downgraded California's credit rating on state
bonds.
But S&P managing director Steven Zimmermann called the governor's executive
order a step in the right direction.
"We're very happy," Zimmermann said. "We were very anxious for the state to
take the general fund out of the energy purchasing position it's been in."

Dan Walters: Once burned, lawmakers are very wary of Davis-Edison agreement


(Published June 20, 2001)
The Capitol's politicians rarely attempt to resolve big, complicated policy
issues, preferring to occupy their time with relatively trivial matters --
which also tend to be the priorities of well-heeled and generous interest
groups.
And when they even acknowledge a need to address something big, they'll often
just nibble at the edges rather than confront the underlying conflicts
squarely. That's been the pattern on water, transportation, population growth
and public education, to name but a few of many examples.
The Capitol completed just one comprehensive, or seemingly comprehensive, bit
of policymaking during the last quarter-century. But the issue on that
occasion was electric utility deregulation, which has exploded into an energy
crisis of monumental proportions. And that experience is having a paralyzing
effect on the Capitol's denizens.
Some Capitol old-timers call it "1890 disease," named after the number of the
1996 bill that created California's fatally flawed system of pricing electric
power. The legislation was written largely by lobbyists for affected interest
groups and then presented to the full Legislature for take-it-or-leave-it
approval. The measure was passed without a single dissenting vote, even
though only a few lawmakers even began to understand its ramifications.
It was a huge failure of the legislative process, virtually a dereliction of
duty, and those who participated have been doing some fancy explaining. But
given the history, both veteran legislators and those who came to the Capitol
after 1996 are very leery about putting their names on additional pieces of
energy policy that could backfire if the real-world outcome is markedly
different from the purported effects.
One example is the $43 billion in long-term energy supply contracts
negotiated by Gov. Gray Davis' administration to end the state's dependence
on volatile spot market prices. When the long-term contracting program was
authorized by the Legislature early this year, it was on the assurances of
the administration that it could obtain large quantities of power at cheap
prices. But by the time that the contracts were made final, months later, the
average price was 25 percent higher than what was stated earlier, while the
spot market had fallen dramatically. Now the long-term contracts that seemed
like such a good idea in January and February could become financial
albatrosses.
An even more telling example is the deal Davis made with Southern California
Edison to keep the utility from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in
bankruptcy. The utilities accumulated at least $13 billion in debts in six
months, buying power at prices much higher than they were allowed to
recapture from their customers. Consumer groups are denouncing the Edison
deal as a corporate bailout that would impose multibillion-dollar burdens on
customers while imposing virtually no financial onus on Edison or its
creditors. And the deal's critics are pouncing on legislators' reluctance to
do something that might haunt them later -- especially in 2002, a critical
election year.
"Five years ago, lawmakers and the utilities foolishly foisted this
deregulation scheme onto California consumers, and now the governor and
Edison expect the ratepayers to pay billions more to save the utilities from
their own mismanagement and bad policy decisions," consumer gadfly Harvey
Rosenfield said Tuesday as legislative hearings opened on the Edison deal.
"This time, the whole world is watching the Legislature."
Harry Snyder of Consumers Union echoed Rosenfield's pledge to hold
legislators accountable. "It looks a lot like 1890," Snyder said. "It's too
big, (and) this is the same process all over again."
The sheer complexity and potential ramifications of the deal are weighing
heavily on lawmakers. "This is not a Mother's Day resolution," Senate Energy
Committee Chairwoman Debra Bowen said wryly as the hearings began. Davis and
Edison lobbyists are pulling out all the stops, but legislators are very,
very nervous about taking another big step that could generate public
backlash.

Senate Democrats lay back to see if FERC action provides rate relief



By Finlay Lewis
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 19, 2001
WASHINGTON ) Key Senate Democrats called a truce Tuesday in the political
wars raging over California's energy crisis, as they adopted a wait-and-see
posture over the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's latest order
restricting electricity prices across much of the West.
Senators of both parties expressed relief over FERC's action on Monday. But
Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., said she was skeptical that the order would
end wholesale price manipulation by power providers or result in refunds to
overcharged ratepayers.
Feinstein and Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., have prepared legislation seeking a
much tighter pricing formula than the one FERC used. But she asked that their
bill be set aside temporarily in deference to the agency's action.
"I think we should wait and see what happens," Feinstein said during a Senate
Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on the FERC order.
Democrats on the committee pressed FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert and the
four other commissioners on why they had not acted sooner to control the
daily price turbulence in the California energy market. A market-intervention
order issued by FERC in April was designed to cope only with energy-supply
emergencies, despite pleas by California Gov. Gray Davis and other California
Democrats for more drastic measures.
"It's time to stop blaming and start problem-solving," said Hebert, a
Republican appointed chairman by President Bush.
Hebert noted that electricity prices on the volatile spot market have dropped
considerably since the April order. Prices on the energy futures market have
also tumbled, as have natural gas prices ) a key component in the cost of
electricity.
On Monday, FERC unanimously ordered around-the-clock restraints on wholesale
electricity prices in California and 10 neighboring states over the next 15
months.
As was the case with the April measure, prices will be pegged to the costs of
the least efficient power provider when reserves in California fall below 7
percent. But when reserves are more plentiful, the prices will drop to 85
percent of the level established during supply shortages.
The order also provides for a 22-day period, involving arbitration and review
by an administrative law judge, for resolving price-gouging allegations and
providing refunds in cases of improper pricing.
Adamantly opposing price controls earlier, FERC acted after coming under
intense pressure from lawmakers of both parties. Republicans said they were
worried that their GOP colleagues in California would have been blamed and
possibly imperiled at the polls if FERC had failed to act.
Bush, who also took a hard line against price caps, blessed FERC's action
after it was taken.
Hebert criticized the bill advanced by Feinstein and Smith as an attempt to
solve California's problem by "bureaucratic fiat."
Their measure would calculate wholesale electricity prices based on the
reported production costs of the individual generators, with an added
allowance for a profit margin.
Hebert argued that the "mitigation price" that FERC will establish "is not a
blunt, arbitrary figure that bears no resemblance to market conditions and is
subject to political pressures and whims."
Meanwhile, Commissioner William Massey made it clear that he harbors
misgivings about the FERC measure, although he supported it.
He said the agency should have acted earlier to avoid the subsequent
"carnage" in California, has failed to provide guidelines that would assure
refunds to overcharged consumers and has acted questionably in allowing power
providers to impose a 10-percent surcharge to cover credit-worthiness risks.
Massey, a Democrat who has consistently criticized his colleagues for moving
too slowing in the California crisis, also said he wondered whether the order
would provide an unintended incentive for generators to continue using
inefficient units in order to assure higher profit margins for their more
modern facilities.
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she would propose legislation later this
week designed to assure refunds to customers who have had to pay unfair
prices for their electricity.
"If FERC won't do it ... Congress should," Boxer said.
A spokesman for Sen. Jeff Bingaman, D-N.M., chairman of the committee, said
Bingaman agreed with Feinstein on the need for a time-out while the FERC
order is being implemented.
Gov. Davis will testify today (6/20) before the Senate Government Affairs
Committee, which is investigating FERC's role in the crisis. Hebert and the
other commissioners will also appear.






House panel erases Bush energy cuts



By Alan Fram
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 19, 2001
WASHINGTON ) A House subcommittee voted Tuesday to spend $1.2 billion more
next year than President Bush proposed for energy and water programs,
underlining lawmakers' sensitivity to the West's power problems and their
desire for home-district projects.
The $23.7 billion measure, approved by voice vote by a panel of the House
Appropriations Committee, is normally one of the more routine of the 13
annual spending measures Congress must approve. But with this year's
escalating battle between Bush and Democrats over energy policy, the
measure's profile has been raised.
The bill would provide $18.7 billion for the Energy Department, $641 million
more than Bush requested and $444 million more than this year. Fiscal 2002,
which the bill covers, begins Oct. 1.
It also includes nearly $4.5 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers and the
hundreds of water projects it has under way across the country, $568 million
more than Bush proposed but $73 million less than this year.
The measure was approved shortly after top members of the committee met with
Bush at the White House.
Participants said Bush and the lawmakers reaffirmed their goal of keeping the
price tag of the 13 bills to $661 billion, which is one-third of the overall
federal budget. That would be a 4 percent boost over 2001, which many
Democrats ) and some Republicans in private ) say is too low.
"He said there would be attempts to raise this as we go through the process,
and let's stick with him," said Rep. Sonny Callahan, R-Ala., chairman of the
energy and water subcommittee.
Illustrating the pressures Republicans face, David Sirota, spokesman for the
Democrats on the committee, said the bill lacked the new spending needed for
renewable energy and other programs that could help alleviate power
shortages.
Under the bill approved Tuesday, renewable energy programs would get $377
million, $100 million more than Bush wanted and $1 million more than this
year. Nuclear energy, basic energy sciences, biological and environmental
research and a study of whether spent nuclear fuel should be stored at a
Nevada site would all get about what Bush proposed.
The bill's $7.03 billion for environmental cleanups is $699 million more than
Bush proposed. Programs aimed at containing the nuclear arsenals of former
Soviet states would get $845 million, $71 million more than Bush's plan.
Members voted to hold the brief meeting behind closed doors after citing the
national security sensitivity of publicly discussing some of the nuclear
weapons programs covered by the bill.






Davis, Regulators Face Off at Hearing

From Reuters

WASHINGTON -- California Governor Gray Davis, a Democrat, today blamed a
Republican-led energy regulatory agency for not doing enough to help his
energy-starved state and demanded refunds of $6.7 billion for alleged
price-gouging by power generators.
Davis, whose political future has been linked to his state's electricity
woes, was testifying at a Senate hearing with members of the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.
The hearing marked the first time that Davis met face to face with all
five FERC commissioners.
FERC regulates interstate electricity markets and has jurisdiction to
order refunds by power generators found to have overcharged utilities.
Earlier this week the agency, led by a Republican majority, rejected
Davis' pleas for strict caps on prices that soared above $400 per megawatt
hour last month.
Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee,
heads the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that quizzed the FERC
commissioners and Davis on efforts to stabilize the chaotic Western
electricity market.
Davis accused FERC of failing to act aggressively against alleged
price-gouging by out-of-state generators.
"To date, not a single penny in refunds has been returned to
Californians," Davis said. "It is unconscionable for the generators to profit
from their egregious overcharges. FERC must move quickly to enforce the law
and order the energy companies to give back the money."
Davis said the state is owed refunds of at least $6.7 billion.
California's grid operator has estimated that from May 2000 to May 2001,
power generators charged the state nearly $9 billion more than a competitive
market would warrant, he said.
California, the nation's most populous state, has been hit with a series
of rolling blackouts, the bankruptcy of its largest utility, and an economic
slowdown since the power crisis began last year.
The state is expected to convene a criminal grand jury to investigate
whether some power generators withheld supplies, shut down plants or
exploited the bidding process to drive up prices. Out-of-state generators
deny any illegal activity, saying the high prices simply reflect supply
shortages.
Today also marks the day that FERC's newly expanded "price mitigation"
program goes into effect in all 11 Western states with a wholesale price
limit of $107.9 per megawatt hour linked to a market formula. The plan had
previously applied only to California during emergency power outages.
Since FERC's action earlier this week, Senate Democrats dropped a
legislative effort to strictly cap electricity prices in the West. However,
California Democrats in the House were still trying to force a full vote on a
package of energy amendments, including a price cap.
The Bush administration and many Republicans oppose price caps,
contending they would discourage more power production.
Separately, today the U.S. Energy Department issued a study that
supported the White House's view that strict price caps would hurt, not help,
California.
The study found California faces about 113 hours of rolling blackouts
this summer, a level that would double if wholesale prices were capped at
$150 per megawatt because some 3,600 megawatts of generating capacity would
shut down. An alternative approach of setting a price cap based on production
costs plus $25 per megawatt would delay or close about 1,300 megawatts of
capacity scheduled to be built in the state, according to the study.
However, lawmakers from both political parties have scrambled for some
kind of solution to address the shortages in California well before the
congressional elections next year.
The FERC plan expands an existing "price mitigation" program in
California to 10 other Western states. The plan, which runs through September
2002, means that during nonemergency periods the price for wholesale power
cannot exceed 85 percent of the cost of electricity sold during a Stage 1
power shortage emergency in California.
A Stage 1 emergency is declared when electricity supplies fall below 7
percent of demand on the Western power grid.
The plan also imposes a 10 percent surcharge on all power sales into
California as financial protection for generators reluctant to sell to the
state's financially weak utilities.
Davis was due to meet the two newest FERC commissioners, Patrick Wood of
Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania, today. Both are former utilities
regulators in states that successfully deregulated their power industry and
nominated to the agency by President Bush.

NEWS ANALYSIS
Energy on Agenda, but Issue Is Blame
Politics: Gov. Davis will try to sway voter anger toward the GOP as he faces
a Senate panel.

By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, Times Political Writer

WASHINGTON--When California Gov. Gray Davis testifies at a high-profile
Senate hearing today, the issue formally on the table will be the expanded
electricity price controls that federal regulators approved this week. But
the session's political subtext will be the escalating struggle between Davis
and national Republicans to determine where California voters look for
solutions--and blame--for the state's power woes.
In both California and Washington, Republican strategists believe Davis
is trying to manufacture a succession of conflicts with the White House that
will allow him to run in 2002 as much against President Bush as against
whomever the state GOP nominates in the gubernatorial race. In return,
Republicans are trying to shift the focus back toward Davis--most
aggressively through a California-wide television advertising campaign
organized by Scott Reed, a former executive director of the Republican
National Committee.
"Our goal is to get the focus back to Sacramento, where it belongs,"
Reed said.
Both sides see the same prize in this tug of war: the opportunity to
determine where most Californians direct their anger during what could be a
long, hot summer of power shortages.
"The situation is that the public's minds are not made up on this
issue--whether it is Sacramento or Washington who has acted too little, too
late," said Mark Baldassare, a pollster at the independent Public Policy
Institute of California. "That gives both sides an opportunity to get their
messages out. The stakes are fairly high in terms of how the public in
California ends up assessing blame over the next few months."

A Slight Uptick in Davis' Popularity
Overall, Davis' political situation appears to be stabilizing. After
months of runaway power costs, the prices the state pays for wholesale
electricity are falling and new plants will come online next month. And
following a free fall in private polls, Davis has seen his numbers tick back
up slightly. Similarly, a poll financed by independent power generators
showed that in mid-June, for the first time in months, Californians were
becoming slightly more confident that the crisis is easing.
Within the state Capitol, Davis is asserting himself, demanding that
lawmakers hold hearings on his rescue plan for Southern California Edison. On
Monday, he released details of a similar plan for San Diego Gas & Electric.
Last week, he announced an agreement that is likely to increase generation by
alternative energy producers, who account for about a fourth of the state's
supply.
"This guy is changing," said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who a
few months back had been urging that Davis take a more aggressive stance on
the crisis. "There is a difference in his demeanor and focus."
Yet the energy crisis still looms as a vast cloud over a reelection
campaign that once looked like a stroll on the beach.
The paradox for Davis is that the substantive victory for pricecontrol
advocates at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission meeting this week may
complicate his political goal of maintaining a heavy focus on Washington.
Though Davis and some congressional Democrats portrayed FERC's decision as
insufficient, it appears to have lanced the pressure for federal legislation
to impose the tighter price controls that Davis supports.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), a principal sponsor of that bill, on
Tuesday announced she would shelve the measure for six months to give the new
FERC plan time to work.
As a result, the political effect of the FERC ruling could be to shift
the focus away from Washington back toward decisions in Sacramento, which is
exactly what Republicans prefer. "Gray Davis is the dog that finally caught
the car," said Dan Schnur, a San Francisco-based GOP consultant. "Davis is
going to keep screaming about price caps and refunds, but now Republicans can
point to substantive action."

Davis: 'Much More They Should Do'
For months, Davis has criticized Bush for refusing to support
electricity price controls and other measures that the governor says could
ease California's energy crunch. At almost every opportunity, Davis offers
the same message: California is taking the steps it needs to, but Washington
has failed to help enough. That was precisely Davis' message Monday when FERC
significantly expanded the limited price caps it had imposed previously.
While saying that FERC had "finally taken a step in the right
direction," Davis added: "There is much more they should do"--including
providing refunds to California for alleged overcharges. The overall tone of
Davis' statement was much more skeptical about FERC's action than the remarks
from Feinstein, who described the decision as "a giant step forward."
Aides say Davis plans to repeat that two-part message in his appearance
today before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.). In his testimony, and in a round of scheduled
television appearances, Davis will demand that FERC order refunds in the
range of $5 billion to $6 billion to the state, aides said. Davis also will
distribute to every member of Congress a 177-page book chronicling the
state's response to the crisis.
Inside the Bush White House, some officials see in Davis' cool response
to FERC's decision more evidence that the governor is determined to use the
White House as a foil in his reelection campaign. The prevailing view, one
official said, is that, no matter what concessions the administration offers,
Davis will immediately raise the bar and demand something else--the way he
did by talking about rebates as soon as FERC offered tougher price controls.
"That is Davis' M.O.," said one official involved in the White House's
energy strategy. "He asks the administration to do something, the
administration does it, and then he attacks the administration for not doing
enough. . . . He needs someone to blame."
Davis aides reject that characterization, arguing that the governor is
merely representing the state's interests against an administration that they
maintain is favoring energy producers over consumers. But Davis advisors
acknowledge that they have used focus groups to test campaign messages that
pin the blame for the energy crunch primarily on Davis' Republican
predecessor, Pete Wilson, and a "Republican president who has failed to stop
his rich friends in the energy industry" from gouging consumers, one aide
said.
"You don't have to tell people in focus groups more than once how this
is connected," the Davis aide said.

Gubernatorial Rivals Are Free of Blame
Baldassare, the independent pollster, notes it may be especially
imperative for Davis to keep Bush's energy decisions in the spotlight because
none of his potential Republican opponents in 2002--California Secretary of
State Bill Jones, former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan or businessman
William E. Simon Jr.--is easily tagged with complicity in the problem. "None
of them were really involved in the decision-making over deregulation,"
Baldassare said. "The only one else to blame, in a political sense, is
Washington and the Bush administration."
The new independent advertising campaign against Davis was inspired
largely by the fear of that strategy succeeding--damaging the standing in
California not only of Bush but also of other Republicans, particularly those
in Congress. Reed, whose American Taxpayers Alliance is funding the ads, said
he decided to launch the campaign after Davis appeared to gain the upper hand
in the media debate following Bush's visit to California late last month.
"The Bush trip really changed the terms of debate about Davis' problem
and made it more of a possible national Republican problem," Reed said. "The
entire terms of debate turned around and was focused on the issue of price
caps as opposed to negligence on Davis' behalf. Our group is attempting to go
out and engage Davis."
To "engage" Davis, Reed's group, which has not revealed its donors, is
spending what he said would be $1.5 million on an initial ad criticizing
Davis this week, though a spot check of TV stations around the state
indicated a far more modest buy. Reed said the group is planning to air a new
ad as soon as this week.
Democrats plan to answer the ads with attacks of their own and will be
filing complaints with the IRS and other federal agencies about the anonymous
funding of the Reed ad.
Today's Senate hearing will give Davis another chance to respond to the
GOP and make his case for greater help from Washington. But Lieberman aides
acknowledge the hearing is likely to be much less confrontational than it
would have been if FERC had not acted Monday. The agency's decision "changed
the dynamic," the aide said.
That assessment may apply not only to the conflict between FERC and its
critics but also equally to the hostilities between Davis and the White House.

Blackout Forecasts' Dark Side
If optimists are wrong and the power runs out, California's energy crisis
could quickly cost lives and cripple the economy.

By JENIFER WARREN, Times Staff Writer

It's here. Summer 2001, the blackout season, is only a day away.
Already Californians anticipate power outages when temperatures rise. By
August, the occasional annoyances endured so far--stoplights gone dark,
computers, air conditioners and elevators idled--could seem almost quaint.
Gov. Gray Davis insists we needn't worry. Four large new power plants
are firing up soon, he said, and government's best and brightest are locking
up still more megawatts to help meet our peak summer need. Californians,
Davis predicts, will valiantly heed his call to conserve, helping the state
survive the hot months, no sweat.
With luck, he'll be right. Power prices have stabilized, and some energy
analysts are wondering whether California may have tamed the blackout beast.
But what if those plants don't get built in time, people don't trim
their electricity use 7% and energy imports are more meager than expected?
And what if the state gets hit by a summer that is not moderately hot,
as Davis bets, but blistering, record-setting hot?
Government experts who ponder such questions don't expect disaster in
the coming months. But they are planning for it nonetheless.
At best, they say, Californians can expect some gridlocked
intersections, an occasionally overloaded 911 system, perhaps some business
bankruptcies, certainly inconvenience. At worst, the Western power grid could
crash, causing uncontrolled blackouts that might lead to looting,
contaminated water supplies, even civil unrest.
"How bad could this summer get?" said state Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana).
"This summer could be the worst disaster to ever hit the state of California."
Imagine it's a Thursday morning in the third week of July. Relentless
heat grips California, the curse of a stubborn high-pressure ridge that just
won't budge.
As air conditioners from Redding to Chula Vista lumber to life, managers
of the state's power grid in Folsom gulp their third and fourth cups of
coffee, stare at a bank of computers and begin to fret.
Demand is jumping. Supply is static, Canada and Arizona have nothing to
sell. It's looking tight.
Thirty minutes later, the picture is gloomier. A brush fire shuts down
transmission lines near Fresno, squeezing supply in the Central Valley. In
the Bay Area, the unusual heat drives demand well past projections.
By noon things look bleak. Operators of the Diablo Canyon nuclear power
plant near San Luis Obispo have cut output by 80%. The trouble? Chunks of
kelp have lodged in one of the plant's seawater intake valves, creating a
clog like one that plagued the facility in January.
With a chorus of groans, the grid's keepers scour the market for power
to offset the Diablo loss. No luck. As the mercury climbs and the Golden
State economy roars into full swing, electricity consumption ticks upward,
minute by minute. And when managers of a power plant near Long Beach cut
output because of a cracked turbine, everyone knows what it means.
Alert the utilities. It's lights out, California, for the fourth day in
a row.
Dr. J. Michael Leary dreads blackouts--not personally, but
professionally. Leary is an emergency room physician in the desert city of
Rancho Mirage. When air conditioners go on the blink there, the
victims--scores of them, mostly old folks--wind up in his ER.
In a normal year, 75% of his emergency patients are geriatrics. Like
infants, the elderly are unusually vulnerable to the heat. When blackouts
hit, they are most at risk.
"It's as if you lived in Maine and they turned the heat off in January,"
Leary said. "This is an extreme environment we live in. The effects can be
devastating."
Many desert seniors are on fixed incomes and live in mobile homes, some
of them poorly insulated boxes that turn into ovens under the brutal summer
sun. Take away the air conditioning and the humans inside start baking, quick.
For Leary, the specter of continual, back-to-back blackouts in
July--and, some predict, in June and August too--conjures images of an
82-year-old man, living alone in one of those mobile homes, taking medication
for heart disease. The cardiovascular drugs plague the man with numerous side
effects; one inhibits his body's ability to cool itself.
When a person gets overheated, body temperature eventually rises
uncontrollably. Then comes a nasty spiral of effects, and pretty soon "you go
into shock," Leary said. "Everything just shuts down."
On average each year, 371 Americans die from heat-related causes, more
than the number killed by earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, lightning and
floods combined. In 1995, a record hot spell in Chicago killed 465 people.
Eleven Californians died from the heat in 1998.
A new report by the United Seniors Assn. predicts that more than half a
million elderly Californians could need hospitalization for heat-related
ailments this summer.
Some communities have laid plans for cooling shelters, wading pools and
other measures to provide relief. But will all who need help get it? Or get
it in time?
Out in the desert, paramedics expect a crush of 911 calls when the power
goes out and the ill, frail and frightened seek help. Leary and others at
Eisenhower Medical Center will be waiting, armed with ice packs, cooled IVs
and ventilators.
"I am very, very worried," the doctor said. "I think we'll see a great
toll in human suffering, even mortality."
California's tomato processors are no less anxious. They wash, cook,
peel, chop, mash and can about 1 million tons of tomatoes a week from July to
October--enough to account for half the world's supply. For them, a string of
unexpected power losses could mean economic ruin in a matter of days.
The reason lies in the peculiar nature of food processing--a sterile
system instantly contaminated if the power fails and the plant's precise
temperature is disturbed.
Once a batch of tomatoes is tainted, it must be thrown out--all 50,000
pounds. The plant must then be sanitized, a painstaking process that takes
about 36 hours.
"If you get hit by blackouts every third day for, say, two weeks, you're
starting, stopping, cleaning, restarting--it's a nightmare," said Jeff Boese,
president of the California League of Food Processors. "You could lose three
batches and be out $40 million before you knew what hit you."
Meanwhile, farmers with still more truckloads of tomatoes line up
outside the plant, waiting to be paid for their crop: "If we can't process
them, the farmers have spent an entire season growing them for nothing,"
Boese said.
In Sonoma County, the object in peril is the chicken. Egg producers
equip their laying houses with fans and swamp coolers to keep the hens
comfortable. Power is also needed to run giant refrigerators filled with eggs.
"In a blackout, those hens can overheat in no time," said Rich Matteis
of the Pacific Egg and Poultry Assn. "In 20 or 30 minutes, you could have
100,000 birds die."
Many large producers have backup generators, but they are not designed
for ongoing, intensive use. Will they hold up? Small-scale egg producers
often have no backup power at all.
Hundreds of other California businesses could suffer if summer shapes up
as bad as some predict.
The Valero Refining Co. of California, northeast of San Francisco,
produces 115,000 barrels of gasoline a day. Because restarting a refinery is
a complicated task, two or three blackouts close together could prompt
officials to shutter it until electricity supplies stabilize--costing
California about 10% of its gasoline supply.
At a Berkeley medical laboratory, doctors say power losses to their
freezers could destroy bone marrow needed to give young leukemia patients
lifesaving transplants. The state's 400 dialysis centers, where patients
without kidney function go to have their blood cleansed every other day, are
in the same fix. Few have backup generators, so when an outage hits,
technicians must crank the machines by hand.
Most Californians, of course, face far more ordinary consequences. The
scoreboards will fizzle at summer softball games, joggers on treadmills will
be stopped in their tracks, electric organs will go silent, leaving choirs to
sing without accompaniment.
Parents will be asked to retrieve children from day-care centers when
the lights and cooling systems conk out. Anniversary lunches may be ruined
when restaurants cannot grill salmon or blend margaritas.
Most people will tolerate occasional disturbances, psychologists say,
doing their part in a time of crisis. But what if such irritations become an
everyday fact of life?
Hundreds of "essential" energy users--including prisons, fire
departments and airports--are protected from blackouts, and hundreds more
have applied for exemptions. That means the pool of people bearing the
blackout burden is shrinking, so more frequent outages are likely.
Blackout predictions vary widely, but at least one forecaster, a
consultant for California water districts, anticipates an outage almost every
afternoon of every workday this summer if temperatures are unusually warm.
Californians are accustomed to trash compactors, giant-screen TVs and
having the Internet at their fingertips. How much deprivation will they
tolerate?
"So far, the version of blackouts we've experienced hasn't looked too
scary to people--it happens on a workday, in the afternoon, and you basically
have to come home and reset your VCR," said Dan Kammen, a professor of energy
and society at UC Berkeley.
But if outages become daily events, and start to invade the evening
hours, the public mood could change abruptly.
"When there's a disaster or crisis or trauma, people tend to act
heroically and work together," said Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles
psychologist and trauma specialist. "But the civilized behavior only lasts a
short period. Then people start acting in unpredictable ways."
That tendency may be exacerbated, Butterworth said, by the nature of the
energy crisis--not a natural disaster, but a man-made one.
"People start to look for a scapegoat," he said. "People will look for a
target, and there's a tendency to strike out at whoever is closest to you."
One place that tendency may surface, Butterworth said, is on
traffic-clogged roads. Blackouts already have led to scores of accidents. Add
summer heat to the mix, and repeat the pattern day after day at rush hour,
and motorists' patience could wear thin, law enforcement officials say.
"We're bracing for . . . possible acts of violence and road rage," said
Sacramento County Sheriff's Lt. Larry Saunders.
Lon House is the water consultant who predicts California could see
blackouts almost every summer weekday. Among the worries for the 440 water
agencies he represents: losing the ability to pump water during wildfire
season.
"I'm telling them to be ready for a major earthquake every day this
summer--meaning all your power is out throughout your district for multiple
hours," House said.
House insists he isn't an alarmist. But on top of the fire fears, he
warns that blackouts of more than a few hours would allow air into water
pipes, contaminating supplies. If that happens, Californians would be urged
to boil their water until the system can be disinfected from one end of the
pipe to the other.
Though rolling blackouts are risky, they remain essentially a controlled
phenomenon, occurring when and where the grid managers and utilities decide.
Far more frightening--and devastating--are unexpected, cascading outages that
could shut down the entire Western power grid. It happened in August 1996,
leaving 4 million people without power during a triple-digit heat wave.
The problem began when power lines in Oregon sagged into trees and shut
themselves off. That triggered a chain reaction of automatic switch-offs and
oscillating surges of energy that ultimately shut down all four of the main
power arteries between California and the Pacific Northwest.
That robbed the system of thousands of megawatts--enough to power the
city of Seattle four times over--and scattered outages across California and
six other Western states. Thousands of customers were without power for more
than a day.
Though such an episode is rare, California grid managers say it is more
likely today because the system is taxed by the ever-increasing load of
electricity it bears.
"The system is very dynamic, and when it's heavily loaded and highly
stressed, like it is now, the smallest little thing could cause big trouble,"
said Kevin Bakker, who oversees California's connection to the greater
Western power grid.
If a massive, uncontrolled outage should hit, the ramifications could be
dizzying, said Mike Guerin, chief of law enforcement for the state Office of
Emergency Services. Police departments would probably go to tactical alert,
guarding against looting by criminals who might take advantage of disabled
alarm systems and darkened street lights.
In hot areas, cities might convert municipal buses--parked with air
conditioners running--into cooling shelters, Guerin said. The state would
provide emergency generators to nursing homes and others in need, while the
California National Guard might be called into action.
"With this kind of blackout scenario, you're not worried about the
bologna going bad in the refrigerator," Guerin said. "We're talking about
doctors doing surgeries on backup generators for three days. We're talking
about a lot of things we don't like to think about."

FERC Move Short-Circuits Push for Hard Price Caps


By RICHARD T. COOPER and JANET HOOK, Times Staff Writers

WASHINGTON--The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's decision to
impose full-time price ceilings on wholesale electricity in California and
the West appears to have deflated the congressional drive for a return to
traditional utility regulation.
Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), calling the "price mitigation" system
FERC unveiled Monday "a giant step forward," announced Tuesday that she is
pulling back her bill to force a return to the "cost of service" pricing
system that prevailed before deregulation. Republican Sen. Gordon Smith of
Oregon, a co-sponsor, agreed, as did Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), chairman of
the Senate Energy Committee.
House Democrats vowed to fight on for tougher controls, but they were
given little chance to succeed.
As a result, although the political blame game will rage on, the reality
of a long, ugly summer for California appears to have arrived: at least
several months of tears, toil, sweat--and fast-rising electric bills.
California consumers are likely to face an unpleasant paradox, energy
analysts said: Given present power shortages, blackouts are virtually
inevitable this summer. And, since state authorities are beginning to let
high wholesale prices flow through into retail bills after months of
subsidies, many consumers could face higher charges at the same time their
lights begin to flicker.
Even if FERC's order succeeds and wholesale prices fall, as they have
begun to do in recent weeks, consumers' bills are likely to rise. Since
retail charges lag well behind wholesale prices, closing the gap will
probably mean a period of higher costs for consumers, regardless of what
happens in wholesale markets.
There is light at the end of the tunnel, energy analysts said, but it is
probably a year away. And reaching it, they said, depends in part on
government officials taking no action that might spook investors and disrupt
present plans for expanding the region's capacity to generate and deliver
more power.
The new FERC system, which its designers said would provide temporary
price relief while preserving incentives for energy investment, imposes
cost-based curbs on wholesale prices throughout the West and covers all such
sales, not just those during periods of extreme shortages, as did the order
issued in April.
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. told the committee the new system
will prevent "megawatt laundering" and other potential abuses. He said his
agency is "committed to ferreting out any forms of market misbehavior 24
hours a day, seven days a week."
With the apparent collapse of demands for more intervention, Congress
now seems ready to give FERC a year or more of leeway to see whether its plan
will curb wholesale prices and create what FERC member Linda Breathitt, a
Democrat, called "a breathing spell" in which California and the West can
"repair their dysfunctional markets."
"It still remains to be seen whether there can be manipulation, but I
think we should wait and see," Feinstein said Tuesday at a Senate Energy
Committee meeting attended by all five FERC members. The commissioners call
their new system "price mitigation," not price caps, but Feinstein said it
amounts to the same thing.
"Whether you call it price mitigation or something else, a rose is a
rose is a rose," said Feinstein, a member of the energy committee.
And Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), appearing before the committee as a
witness, said: "I was very pleased with [Monday's] about-face by FERC. I
believe they have a new tone."
Democrats on the other side of the Capitol pledged to keep fighting for
traditional regulation, but with Republicans in control of the House, the
struggle appears to be largely symbolic.
House Democrats wanted to introduce amendments on price controls and
other energy policy to a mid-year supplemental appropriation bill due to come
before the House today. However, GOP leaders expected to block Democrats from
even offering the amendments on procedural grounds.
The most sweeping of the amendments would set cost-based limits on
wholesale energy prices in the West. Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and
other sponsors insisted that the measure is still needed in spite of the FERC
action, which he said would continue to provide windfall profits to
generators, encourage suppliers to withhold power and do too little to
restrain the price of natural gas.
He called the FERC policy an "experiment" that is using California and
other Western states as subjects.
Similarly, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco) said: "Although the FERC
decision [Monday] is a step in the right direction, I am concerned it does
not remove incentives for energy suppliers to withhold power, drive up prices
and gouge consumers."
The commission went as far as it did in part because of the specter of
broader price control legislation, Pelosi said. "They felt the heat, they saw
the amendments coming and decided to act."
And Rep. Bob Filner (D-San Diego), in an interview Tuesday, said he will
press ahead with legislation to impose hard price caps. "I would advise the
senators that after a year of dealing with these price gougers that they will
easily manipulate this latest order," he said, calling it a "Swiss cheese
order--full of holes."
Feinstein's shift put House Democrats in an awkward political position
because it came just as they prepared to make their big push for tougher
controls. But the Democrats tried to minimize the differences in legislative
strategy.
"She too is waiting to see if the FERC experiment works," Waxman said.
"I'm a little more skeptical, but we're both watching carefully."
As a political matter, a Democratic leadership aide acknowledged, the
FERC order muddies the debate at a time when Democrats have been working hard
to make it a defining issue--and one they had hoped would help them win
control of the House in the 2002 elections.
"It's hard to describe to people what the difference is between what we
want and what FERC has done," said the aide.
And Republicans said FERC's action had clearly taken the wind out of the
sails of price control efforts that some GOP strategists feared might have
passed the House.
"I would have thought [it would pass] last week," said John Feehery,
spokesman for House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.). "But now, with what
FERC did, it takes a lot of air out of the balloon."
"I think the FERC action will dissipate that strong push," agreed Emily
Miller, a spokeswoman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas). "It will
take the heat off."
House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) said the message to Democrats
was, "It's time to come off your political high horse."
He said he wanted to keep Democrats from offering their price control
amendment to Wednesday's supplemental appropriation bill because the proposal
is "a political statement, not a policy statement."

Plan Won't Raise Rates, Davis Says
Edison: Governor seeks to assure Senate, where Democrats say action is a
bailout of nearly bankrupt utility.

By CARL INGRAM, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--Gov. Gray Davis sought to assure the state Senate on Tuesday
that his plan to save Southern California Edison from threatened financial
collapse would work without increasing customer rates.
Davis sent assurances to the Senate Energy Committee through his top
attorney, Barry Goode, who helped negotiate the controversial proposal with
the utility.
Senate Republicans have taken a wait-and-see attitude on the plan. But
they generally contend that the business of utilities belongs in the hands of
private enterprise.
But Democrats in both houses have charged that the deal between Democrat
Davis and Edison represents a state bailout of the nearly bankrupt
Rosemead-based utility. The analysis is shared by leading consumer activists.
At the first in a series of Senate hearings on the package, which is
considered all but dead in its current form, Sen. Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto)
voiced concerns about political problems with the plan.
He asked Goode, who was flanked at a witness table by Edison executives,
whether monthly bills of the utility's customers would increase as a
consequence of approval of the governor's package.
"Our models say there will be no additional impact on the ratepayers,"
Goode replied.
Other members appeared ready to pursue rate increase questions, but
Chairwoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) cut them short. She said the issue
would be fully examined at a later hearing.
To spare Edison from going into bankruptcy and to restore its
credit-worthiness, Davis and executives of the utility reached a complex
compromise in April, the centerpiece of which was a state purchase of
Edison's transmission grid for about $2.8 billion, more than twice its book
value.
Edison has estimated that it owes $3.5 billion to creditors, including
wholesale power generators, as a result of deregulation of retail electricity
prices in 1996.
Because of a freeze in retail rates, Edison was prohibited from passing
its energy costs to customers.
Other features of the deal include dedicating a portion of consumer
rates to help pay off the debt, a guaranteed 11.6% rate of return to Edison
on its sales and investments, and termination of an ongoing Public Utilities
Commission investigation into financial dealings of Edison's parent company,
Edison International.
The energy committee held the hearing for fact-finding purposes and did
not consider the Edison bill, SB 78x by Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles).
But the Davis-Edison deal has angered consumer activists, who contended
that bankruptcy for Edison would be preferable.
They deplored it as a bailout that would cost Edison customers $5
billion to $7 billion.
"If the Legislature makes the mistake of forcing the ratepayers of
California to pay one more penny to bail out these companies, we will put [an
initiative] right on the ballot," said Harvey Rosenfield of the Foundation
for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights.
Consumer organizations in 1998 put to the voters an initiative to junk
the 1996 deregulation law. The measure failed.
Rosenfield, Harry Snyder of Consumers Union and Matt Freedman of the
Utility Reform Network all asserted at a news conference that the Davis
rescue program should be killed.
Snyder, who opposed deregulation, said the governor's bill is shaping up
as a replay of 1996.
"It's too big, too complicated. . . . This is the same process that
brought about this [deregulation] disaster," Snyder said.
Separately, San Diego Gas & Electric agreed Monday to sell its
transmission grid to the state for about $1 billion on the same terms as
Edison.
With all the controversy surrounding the Edison deal, the chance of
SDG&E winning legislative approval of its sale is slightly better than 50%,
said Stephen L. Baum, chief executive of Sempra Energy, parent of SDG&E.
"I think there's a widely shared view in the Legislature that they don't
want the state in the long-term business of power procurement. . . . In order
to get Edison back into that business there has to be this infusion of
capital" to pay off past electricity debts and make the utility
credit-worthy, Baum said.

State to Pay Electric Bill With Loan, Not Taxes


By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--California taxpayers, who have had to bankroll billions of
dollars in electricity purchases for the teetering power utilities, will soon
no longer see their money evaporate at record rates, under an executive order
by Gov. Gray Davis.
As early as next week, the order will stop the hemorrhaging of the state
budget by allowing Treasurer Phil Angelides to borrow $5 billion to buy
electricity. That money is expected to cover power purchases until this fall,
when the state plans to sell an unprecedented $12.5 billion in bonds to repay
the general tax fund and buy future electricity.
Angelides said Tuesday that he has already lined up $3.5 billion in
loans from two Wall Street firms, and expects to secure at least another
billion by next week, when he plans to close the deal and obtain the money.
The loan is critical, he said, because without it, electricity purchases
would completely deplete state coffers as early as October.
"In essence, it stops the general-fund bleeding," Angelides said. "What
this interim financing does is take the pressure off the general fund and,
hopefully, avert a cash crisis."
The loan could also ease concerns on Wall Street that California's risky
entry into the power business has placed the state budget in a precarious
position. Those concerns were one of the main reasons two major credit rating
agencies downgraded the state earlier this year.
"We have been looking forward to this day," said Ray Murphy, a vice
president at Moody's Investors Service, one of the two firms that downgraded
California's credit rating. "We view this as a positive first step toward
getting the state out of the power business. We wanted the state to get the
general fund out of the business as quickly as possible."
California has allocated $8.2 billion in taxpayer money for electricity
since January because the state's private utilities became too saddled with
debt to continue purchasing power on the open market. and massive blackouts
loomed.
Under a plan devised by Davis and approved by the Legislature, the state
budget is supposed to be reimbursed for the power purchases with the bond
issue, the largest in American history. The bonds, in turn, are to be paid
off by utility ratepayers through their monthly bills.
The bond issue, however, has been delayed by partisan politics and
complex legal issues raised by the bankruptcy of Pacific Gas & Electric Co.,
the state's largest private utility.
A bond sale initially planned for May is now scheduled for late
September, according to Angelides' latest estimate. The state's Public
Utilities Commission still needs to take a number of technical actions before
the sale can take place.
As a result, the state budget has been drained for power purchases far
longer than initially anticipated--a situation that has imperiled spending on
education, transportation and other critical needs, at least temporarily.

Priggish and piggish in California
Mark Steyn
National Post
A hurricane devastated Tristan da Cunha last month. It swept in May 23, but
no one heard about it till the other day because it damaged the island's
radio link to the outside world. The storm blew sheep into the chilly South
Atlantic, killed many cattle, damaged every single home on the island,
demolished the hospital and community centre, blew the roof off the radio
station, and wrecked the Albatross, the only pub in the only village,
Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. For a week after the storm, the entire island
was without electricity.
And no one in the rest of the world knew a thing about it! Not the island's
colonial masters in London. Not the Governor, who doesn't actually reside
there but prefers to live 1,260 miles away on St. Helena, Tristan da Cunha's
nearest neighbour. (St. Helena is Manhattan to Tristan's Weehawken, New
Jersey.) Plunked in the ocean midway between Argentina and South Africa,
Tristan da Cunha is the world's most isolated human settlement. Its contact
with the rest of humanity is limited to one annual visit from a British
supply vessel, plus the occasional cruise ship, which anchors offshore when
it's safe to do so.
Now that's living off the grid.
The East India Company won a charter to settle Tristan in 1658, and it's been
a Crown colony since 1834, populated by a handful of families from the
Scottish borders. There are just seven surnames on the island: Glass, Green,
Hagan, Lavarello, Repetto, Rogers and Swain. All 290 of them turned up in
London 40 years ago, when the island's volcano erupted and they were
evacuated to the Imperial capital. In the roaring traffic's boom, midst the
glitter of one of the world's great cities, the islanders voted to return
home -- though even getting there was tricky, as their landing dock was
covered in lava. Today the colony is virtually self-sufficient in food and
has a reasonably thriving economy based on crawfish and selling its
commemorative postage stamps to overseas philatelists.
London has offered o75,000 to repair the communications equipment and pay for
a new hospital. (You can build a hospital for under 75,000 quid? Amazing.)
Otherwise, the islanders are just doing what they usually do: making the best
of things. While they're waiting for the new hospital, they've arranged for a
South African fishing vessel to ferry out a second-hand X-ray machine when it
sails next week.
Now, consider by way of contrast, the inhabitants of what George W. Bush
amusingly calls "the great state of California." Once upon a time, California
was, like they say of Tristan da Cunha, "the furthest thing," at least in
terms of the North American continent. Today, with a population the size of
Canada's, it's one of the world's largest economies, the home base of
America's biggest industry -- entertainment. But inside many a studio
vice-president is a Tristan da Cunha islander trying to get out. Deep in
their hearts (assuming, for the purposes of discussion, that studio
vice-presidents have hearts), they share the same rugged virtues as the
Tristanians, though they prefer something a little better than a $100,000
hospital and they've no desire to scrape a living from catching crawfish, but
if the pool boy wants to have a go up the deep end he's welcome to try.
And therein lies the contradiction. California's self-inflicted energy crisis
has exposed the preposterousness of poseur-conservationism in a booming
economy. Which state has the most rigorous conservation program? California.
Which has the lowest per capita electricity consumption? California. And
which state is panicking at the prospect of a summer of rolling blackouts? By
now impeccably progressive California should have learned the hard way that
conservation is not a viable policy for a non-stagnant economy.
Instead, a rolling blackout here, a rolling blackout there, and they're
running around like headless chickens. Governor Gray Davis is lashing out at
everyone in sight -- Bush and Cheney are "irresponsible," the power
generators are "unconscionable" -- no, wait, they're "snakes" and "robber
barons." And how do you treat unconscionable robber snakes like Ken Lay, CEO
of Enron Corp.? "I would love," said Bill Lockyer, California's
Attorney-General, "to personally escort Lay to an 8x10 cell that he could
share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi, my name is Spike, honey.' "
As the state's Attorney-General, Mr. Lockyer cannot summarily sentence
citizens to anal rape, but no doubt, once the guy's convicted, he can make
some quiet recommendations as to appropriate cell mates. Fortunately for Mr.
Lay, as chief exec of the world's largest energy trader, he doesn't live in
California, he lives in Texas. Indeed, very few of the folks the State of
California would like to sic Spike on are within their jurisdiction:
Doubtless the taxpayers of British Columbia, whose BC Hydro has been living
high off the hog on California's woes, could also use a little light buggery,
but I can't see a Canadian court approving extradition. Nevertheless, in a
state that's over-regulated, bans new power plants and is addicted to price
caps, Mr. Lockyer has ingeniously managed to come up with yet another
disincentive for anybody in the energy business to relocate to La-la-land.
California bought into the soft-eco Sierra Club illusion -- that somehow one
could be a conservationist, with no consequences for one's economic
well-being. To put it in terms Californians can understand: Suppose you build
a house out in the desert. But you don't want to buy a car, because that's
bad for the environment, isn't it? So instead every morning you call a
taxicab in the city to drive out, pick you up and take you into the office.
Not only does it have no environmental benefit but there's no point bitching
and whining because the driver charges you a fare that bears no relation to
the cost of gas.
Yet that's what Governor Davis and the Anal Attorney are demanding: price
caps. Through its own incompetence, California is wholly dependent on energy
generators and distributors from other jurisdictions. But it expects those
companies to forgo the interests of their own stockholders and service
California -- i.e., Hollywood and Silicon Valley -- as an act of public
welfare. "A 500% profit is swine-like, piggish and totally unreasonable,"
says Medea Benjamin of the California human rights group Global Exchange.
She may have a point, but, if California's going to institute price caps,
they might like to start closer to home. After all, if Enron's board members
don't really need those big salaries, do Paramount's or Universal's? I mean,
sure, Ken Lay has an easy job, but how difficult is it for an exec honcho in
Century City to sit at a desk and greenlight another John Travolta flop every
couple of months? I mean, surely, the guy could do the job on, oh, $25,000 a
year. And that'd be good for conservation, 'cause he'd have to give up the
Merc and the Cherokee and the LearJet and take the bus. And how about
Travolta? Instead of $20-million per picture, maybe he could get by on just
two or three and the remaining $17-million could be put into those renewable
energy projects he's so keen on. I mean, a $20-million salary isn't just
swine-like, it's piggish, right?
Since its entry into the Union, California has had what we 19th-century
imperialists call "responsible government." Tristan da Cunha doesn't. Yet its
community leaders are behaving far more maturely and responsibly than
California's. Gray Davis is acting not like the elected Governor of an
American state but the appointed Governor of a Crown colony, feverishly
cabling head office to send somebody out to rescue him. You're on your own,
man. And, if California conservationists find rolling blackouts too onerous,
they should try spending a week in the dark, cut off from the outside world
and knowing that, even when the radio starts working again, it's going to
take months for the second-hand X-ray machine to arrive.

Summary

-Yesterday's hearing confirmed imminent death of SoCal MOU
-Plan(s) B also drew little support; state "trust" for generators unlikely
-QF/SoCal negotiations are "treading water" as SoCal runs out the clock;
tries to postpone involuntary filing
-BK court unlikely to view SoCal payments to QFs as preferential because of
state order

Report

1. Few Signs of Legislative Support for SoCal MOU

Sources report that Bryson is in regular contact with many legislators,
but especially with Hertzberg and Keeley on the Assembly side (from which
the Plan B is being directed) and Bowen (Senate Energy Chairperson) on the
Assembly side.  Sources believe that Bryson's comment may about the
legislature 'warming up to the MOU' may be a smokescreen; Democratic Senator
Alarcon said in the MOU hearing yesterday that the MOU is dead and is not
going to pass.  Reportedly no one attempted to contradict him.

Members of the Chamber of Commerce, large energy users,  TURN, the California
Manufacturers' and Technology Association (CMTA) and  others also spoke out
against the MOU.  (Sources found it remarkable that  TURN and the CMTA, who
have been rivals in Plan B negotiations, agreed with each  other in strongly
attacking the MOU.

2. Plan(s) B Are Still Foundering

The Plan(s) B were not discussed at the hearing, though some of the same
issues came up.  For instance, it was discussed whether it was possible to
transfer all of Edison's obligations to a trust that pays out after the
conclusion of litigation.  In the opinion of the governor's counsel and
other lawyers present, this is "shaky," especially without the consent of
creditors.  In their opinion, there would have to be an agreement that would
pay off everything.

The governor's counsel stated there were constitutional problems with setting
up a trust for what the generators are owed, then letting them litigate over
the trust.  Also, he stated that it was not feasible for the state to be
offering generators cash on the one hand while the FERC negotiated with them
to refund the state for power
purchases (as ordered in the FERC decision Monday).  The governor's counsel
stated that the only reasonable thing for the state to do was to give the
generators their cash, then sue them for it.

3. QF/SoCal Negotiations Are "Treading Water"

QF sources suggest that the debate between SoCal and the PUC as to whether
the QFs should be paid 10% or 15% of what they are owed is "not a real
question," but rather a stalling measure allowing SoCal to hold on to cash
in advance of a filing or a global solution.  "SoCal is just treading water,"
said a source.


4. SoCal Payments to QFs Unlikely to be Viewed As Preference  Payments

Sources also comment that SoCal payments to the QFs likely would not be
seen as a preference payment in bankruptcy court because they were ordered
by a state agency, the PUC.  However, comments made in the SoCal conference
call yesterday seem to indicate that Solomon Smith and perhaps other
creditors may see the payments this way and may be willing to sign a
bankruptcy petition.

Mark,
If you where to look at it from an Palo index basis, how would this look?  I think he wants to float with an index price but wants some feel for what type of basis to Palo we would use.   Its not really a firm bid since he is not really going to transact, so its really an indication of the market.  Kind of odd, but the better we make our price relative to Palo, the more likely we can get the business.  We should show him a strong bid subject to credit etc.   When the time comes to actually lock it in,  and most likely he will not since the units have no historical performance,  who knows what the market price  will be.
Mike

FYI.  Hertzberg and Keeley were in the negotiations this morning.  We gave
him an earful about this coming down the pike, and the fact that the
contracts (which are too expensive and which no one wants) are driving
everything and unless something gives, we can pack it up, go home and turn
the keys over the Freeman and his bozos at DWR.

The Sacramento types are mobilized on the issue and Hertzberg said that he's
going to meet with the Governor and call Loretta.  We meet again tomorrow at
10 to discuss the need to get rid of the contracts and to keep DA alive.
I'll report back with any pertinent info.

Best,
Jeff

Hi Jake and the rest of you,

I went there too (33rd and Powell) and found that no one was there.
Beautiful open field, nets and no one to kick it around with.  It does look
like a good place to practice though and it was open on Sunday at 1.  I also
know that many of you had told me you were not available so I was expecting
a small turnout but I thought Brad's team would be there.  Not sure what
happened I guess Brad's Team either took the week off,  moved, or changed
times. If any one sees him ask what is going on. I did try and call Brad but
the number I have for him is no longer in service. I also went over to
Madison High on 58th and Division where we used to scrimmaged and no one was
their either.    I will try an sort this out this week and send out another
e-mail regarding practice.  I know Justin Kerr and Adam Van Loon have
invited us to come out on Thursday night 6 to 8 at Oregon Episcopal School
(OES) to scrimmage with his high school soccer team for the next couple of
weeks.  Is that still ok Justin or Adam?   Let us know.  Sorry about the no
show practice I'll try and sort it out.  Take care.

A story from the Associated Press on Gov. Davis' announcement  that he will
reveal the details of 38 power contracts is included  below.

Some information I received that is not in the  story:

The sequence of events appears to be that the governor will  announce
tomorrow how he will reveal the contract details. This  announcement may be
in conjunction with anattempt in a San Diego  courtto invalidate the
confidentiality agreements within the  contracts. The court hearing is part
of the lawsuit by newspapers and  Republicans to make the contracts public.

Davis has reportedly speculated that the actual details will  be released
near the end of the week. Some information apparently will be  removed from,
or blacked out in, documents that are issued.

One impetus could be that the details of some of the contracts  have
apparently been leaked by various sources. One reporter told me he
understood that FERC had given some congressional Republicans details on the
contracts. The one name was given to me as a recipient of the details was
Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana.

Davis had also promised to make the contract details available  within 6
months of when they were first signed, a deadline that would expire in
mid-July.



Governor plans to release details of long-term  power contracts

SACRAMENTO - Gov. Gray Davis plans to  release the
much-sought details this  week of 38 long-term contracts between the
state and power generators, aides said Tuesday.
"We now believe that the  balance tips in favor of disclosure
rather than continuing to withhold the contracts," said  Davis
senior adviser Nancy  McFadden.
Republican  lawmakers and several news organizations, including
The Associated Press, filed lawsuits in March saying  Davis' refusal
to release details of the  state's electricity purchases violates
the California Public Records Act.
But the Davis administration has  refused to release the
contracts, saying  that revealing the details would put the state at
a competitive disadvantage in other contract  talks.
The state has  been purchasing power since January for customers
of three cash-strapped utilities. Much of that has been  on the
expensive spot market, but  increasingly, state officials have
locked in contracts for long-term deals.
Raymond Hart, Department of Water  Resources deputy director,
sent letters  to power generators Monday saying the department will
ask a judge Wednesday to throw out a confidentiality  provision in
the contracts.
While revealing the details  still might pose some problems in
negotiations, "those impacts are far more limited than  they might
have been had the contracts  been released even two weeks ago," the
letter states.
Senate leader John Burton, D-San  Francisco, said lawmakers need
to see  the details of the contracts before they could approve the
governor's plan to rescue Southern California Edison, or  any
alternate plan.
"Until we see those contracts, and  know exactly what's in them,
we can't  make a determination," Burton said. "There was an
argument that I think was valid that the governor made at  beginning
of the contracts. ... We're  totally beyond that now."
Burton said Tuesday he'll introduce  three energy-related
measures in the  Legislature - including one that would repeal a 10
percent rate hike scheduled to take effect next  year.
The 1996  electricity deregulation law included an automatic 10
percent rate reduction until March 2002. Burton's bill  would remove
that out from state law,  but the Public Utilities Commission could
still raise rates if commissioners felt it was  needed.
Burton is  also authoring a bill to provide backup battery power
for traffic signals in some intersections to keep the  lights on
during blackouts.
Burton's third measure is a  resolution that voices support for
Davis  to commandeer power plants under his emergency powers
authority.
"The governor talks about it," Burton  said. "We're going to
show him that  there is support in the Senate for seizing these
power plants from these generators who have been ripping  us off."

A little summary of my travels so far!


After several e-mails back to myself, I believe I have figured out how to use this keyboard and the writing s hopefully readable {The poor grammar cannot be blamed on the keyboard though}.

On the plane over here, I met a turkish girl who used to be an english teacher, and hence spoke very good english.  I ended up staying at her place my first night in Turkey, she was going to give me a ride to my hotel but did not want to venture into the area in which the hotel was booked (don't trust everything you read on the internet!).  The plane got in very late, and I had not slept at all and was very tired.  A nice muslim priest decided to serenade me at 4:30 am from the mosque just down the hill, and my attempt at sleep ended.  Turns out muslims must pray five times a day, and the mosques blare out prayers to ensure that you don't forget.

We had breakfast on the bosphorus the following morning, where I was able to learn a little bit about the traffic laws in Turkey.  We were eating across the street from a police station on a one way road, yet that didn't stop anyone from driving the wrong way down the one way!  They drive like maniacs here, and are encouraged as far as I can tell.  The traffic lights in the towns actually have a countdown timer on them, and the light goes from red to yellow to green, just like at a racetrack!  Go figure!

I got on a bus to head south, and learned several things about Turkish culture and myself!  First, very few turkish speak english (I had kinda assumed that they all spoke english after taking to an english teacher on the plane), secondly, I cant speak Turkish!  After a while, I managed to write down where I wanted to go and found someone to point me in the proper direction.  The buses here are awesome, they give you coffee and tea, cookies and some lemon smelling stuff to put on your hands.  Partway through the trip some army guys got on the bus, and a guy with a big machine gun came and sat down beside me.  He stunk but I was not about to tell him so!!

I spent my first day touring the battlefields of Galipolli, with several Australians and New Zealanders.  The tourguide was awesome, and the site was really neat (although very few Canadians fought there).  I got back on a bus that evening and traveled to a town down south.  I met some New Yorkers on the bus, and they made me question my decision to go to school n the US.  One of the girls had no clue where Calgary was, until I explained to here that it was just north of Montana, it was the typical 'Speak American Please!'

On Saturday I toured the ancient ruins at Pergamum, which are located above the town of Bergama on top of a huge hill.  I decided after touring that I would walk back to town (about 5k),  wearing my big backpack n 35C heat!  After walking all the way down the hill, I got to the barbwire topped fence surrounding the ruins, I felt like an idiot but there was no way I was climbing back up the hill!  There were several young local guys running down the road, and I asked them for help.  There only suggestion was to jump the fence (explained by hand signals because they spoke little english),  and I figured it was worth a try!  I managed to get over the barbwire with my backpack and only cut up my knee a little bit.  They walked back to the village with me, and wanted me to pay for them to go to the other historical sites (I think?).  I took off faster than having being chased by an angry old man after snowballing cars, and hopped! on the next bus out of town.

Sunday I toured the ruins of Ephesus, which were really neat, and saw an old roman theater that Elton John had played in April.  Sunday I went up to the travertines at Pamukale, one of the seven wonders of the Ancient World.  The hillside is covered with calcium deposits, and there is water running down which collects in these pools where you were once allowed to swim (no longer because they were being destroyed).  Today I am sitting in a port town called Bodrum, and have just finished touring a ancient castle, and am heading to the mausoleum (another of the seven wonders!).  Following this, I am going to go to Marmaris and get on a sailboat tomorrow for a four day trip around many small islands in the Mediterranean Sea.

Hope all is well in Calgary, and will keep you all up to date through my journeys!

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Attached are two documents which summarize the status of our review
of documents at Enron's San Francisco offices. Based on interviews with
Enron officers and employees we identified about 50 boxes documents for
review. About thirty of these boxes have potentially relevant documents. The
first memorandum categorizes the potentially responsive documents by the
each specific request made by the Dunn subpoena. The second memorandum
describes the location and contents of each of the fifty boxes we selected
for review.
We now need to review these potentially relevant documents for
privilege and confidential information.We estimate about ten boxes of
responsive, non-privileged documents will result from the review of these
files. Many of these documents will also be responsive to the subpoena
served by the California AG on Enron on June 21.  We recommend that we copy
these thirty or so boxes of documents, move the copies to our San Francisco
office for further review, selection for production, and bates stamping.
Pending your approval we plan to begin doing so Thursday morning.
The following issues need prompt attention:

.Michael McDonald: He is on vacation until June 11 and we have not
been able to reach him. He is said to have wholesale power sales and
financial information on his hard drive, which we cannot now access. Someone
needs to reach him.
.Review of electronic files: We have not reviewed electronic files
in California. McDonald and Parquet are the only Enron North America Vice
Presidents in the San Francisco office and we should review their files
before the end of the week. To do any more electronic review of individual
hard drives will consume a great deal of time.
.Intranet files: There are numerous responsive files on the Enron
intranet which are routinely and easily accessed and manipulated
by the San Francisco office. We have not reviewed these intranet files, but
the ease by which these files can be accessed in California could pose a
problem with regard to our arguments regarding the territorial limits of.
the subpoena.
. Confidentiality concerns: We copied examples of documents which
are described as sensitive or confidential by Enron officers in San
Francisco. We will send these examples to Bob, Richard, and Mike Kirby for
their comment on Thursday.
. Duty to notify third parties: Some of the responsive documents
require Enron to notify third parties if the documents are to be released to
others. If we plan to release these documents on June 10,  we need to give
notice soon, probably by Friday. There are a great number of EES contracts
and documents related to EES's contracts with its customers, which are
requested by both Dunn and the AG. Most of these contracts have
confidentiality clauses which require EES to either notify the customers or
fight the production of the contract. We should decide soon if we plan to
produce these documents on June 10 and what notice we must give EES
customers.

Mediator talked of a bigger refund: He reportedly suggested a $4.5 billion
deal midway through the failed talks.
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published July 11, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- Midway through the negotiations between California and power
sellers to settle the myriad issues arising out of the state's energy crisis,
the mediator told California's negotiating team that he thought a deal worth
more than $4.5 billion would be appropriate -- a much higher figure than he
suggested after the talks ended Monday.
Whether the statement by Curtis Wagner, the chief administrative law judge
for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, was a negotiating ploy or a
reflection of his evolving beliefs is not clear.
Before the settlement talks began two weeks earlier, Wagner said he thought
Gov. Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in refunds was too high and that a
settlement probably would be in the range of $2 billion to $2.5 billion.
The disclosure that Wagner had contemplated a much higher figure midway
through the negotiations suggests the state had more support than the judge
let on Monday when he said after the talks foundered that he thought a deal
should involve "hundreds of millions, maybe a billion" dollars.
While the state wants $8.9 billion, $3 billion of that was for overcharges
during the five months preceding last October and are beyond FERC's scope of
review. Even as a starting point then, the $4.5 billion mentioned by Wagner
represented 75 percent of the money the state was demanding for alleged price
gouging between October and May.
The judge's $4.5 billion figure, divided between cash payments and savings
from long-term power contracts, was confirmed by three sources who asked to
be identified only as "close to the negotiations" because participants had
been required to sign confidentiality statements.
The sources gave virtually identical accounts of a July 2 meeting with Wagner
in which the judge also dismissed as "inadequate" a $670 million settlement
offer made by power generators and marketers.
By Monday, the settlement offer had risen to $716 million. But the state
refused to back off its $8.9 billion demand, and there never was any serious
back-and-forth negotiations during the 15-day period the regulatory
commission had given Wagner to craft a deal.
As a consequence of the failed talks, Wagner said Monday that within a week
he will send the five-member commission his recommendations on how it might
approach an order refunding power overcharges.
Among Wagner's suggestions is that the commission convene a hearing before a
different administrative judge to take testimony from generators, marketers
and the state on how to arrive at a fair settlement.
The options sketchily outlined by Wagner on Monday included limiting the time
when refunds are allowed -- something that could reduce state claims by about
one-third -- and changing the way power plant costs are calculated to a
formula more favored by generators.
It is not clear whether Wagner, who moved from one negotiating team to
another during his two-week quest for a deal, ever raised the $4.5 billion
settlement figure to the power marketers and generators.
Joel Newton, who represented Dynegy Power, Duke Energy, Reliant Energy,
Williams-AES and Mirant in the talks, said Tuesday he was bound by the
confidentiality pledge to keep silent on the internal negotiations.
Wagner also is refusing all media calls.
According to the account of the negotiations confirmed by sources Tuesday,
Wagner was angry at the snail's pace of progress after the first week of the
talks.
On Friday, June 29, Wagner called everyone into his hearing room and scolded
them. He condemned the California team, saying they all ought to wear "clown
suits" because they were "in the pocket" of Davis and refused to show any
independence.
He then turned to the generators and said that after a week of talks, nothing
had been heard from them. He told them he wanted them to produce "real
numbers, and hard numbers" over the weekend and that if they didn't, he would
-- "and you're not going to like it."
Wagner's admonition apparently moved no one toward a deal. On Monday, in the
meeting with the California delegation, one source quoted Wagner as saying
the settlement number he received from the generators and marketers "is so
low I can't even present it to you."
"I'm not happy with the figures, they're not adequate," others quoted the
judge as saying.
At that point, the sources said, Wagner said he was thinking of a settlement
of $2.5 billion in cash, $2 billion in long-term contract savings and other
money from out-of-state investor-owned utilities and even the federal
Bonneville Power Administration, which markets power from dams in the
Northwest.
But as the clock wound down on the negotiations, nothing much happened until
Friday and Saturday, when the California team met with the five largest power
generators.
It was at those meetings that the generators offered $510 million in refunds
to settle their disputes with the state. But the money would have gone to
reduce the tab for what they were owed by the state and California utilities,
and it was loaded with conditions, including the state dropping all of its
investigations and lawsuits.
Wagner declared the talks over Monday, saying he was unable to bring the
parties together.

Davis repeats threat to sue FERC to get full refund
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published July 11, 2001)
Gov. Gray Davis shot words of caution at federal regulators Tuesday, warning
that he will sue them if they order power companies to refund anything less
than the $8.9 billion he and other state officials have demanded.
The Democratic governor also lobbed threats at state legislators, suggesting
that he may call a special session to prevent them from embarking upon a
monthlong summer break next week.
Instead of vacationing, Davis said, lawmakers must work to approve an
agreement between the state and Southern California Edison that would save
the utility from bankruptcy.
Though the governor has indicated previously that the state may take the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to court, his announcement Tuesday made
it clear he intends to follow through.
Settlement talks with power generators to determine how much, if any, the
companies overcharged California for electricity concluded Monday with no
resolution.
Now, the decision rests with the FERC's governing board, and Davis said the
state won't back away from the $8.9 billion figure it demanded during talks.
"You order what you think is fair," Davis said during a news conference with
the state's top negotiators. "We'll take what you order, and we'll see you in
court."
Davis acknowledged that a legal battle could drag out for months or years.
He added that he believes the disagreement -- or even a protracted court
battle -- will not affect a tentative agreement between the state and Edison.
Under terms of the deal, money to pay off the utility's debt would come from
a state purchase of its transmission lines and from a portion of consumers'
electricity rates.
According to the agreement, the Legislature must approve the deal by Aug. 15,
and Davis said he intends to hold lawmakers to that date.
Davis said the deadline is important because creditor committees will
scrutinize the Legislature's every move to determine whether to force Edison
into bankruptcy court rather than await a political deal.
Legislators are scheduled to leave for summer recess July 20 and return Aug.
20.
Davis threatened to use his executive powers to force lawmakers to remain in
Sacramento and work on the Edison agreement, if necessary.

Dan Walters: Davis plays in a virtual world while the energy reality continues
(Published July 11, 2001)
California still has a very real and very severe energy crisis, to wit:
The state is still running up massive debts as it pays more for power than it
can recover from ratepayers and is having trouble borrowing billions of
dollars to cover the debt.
There is a strong possibility, perhaps a probability, that when summer's heat
truly descends, there will be severe power blackouts as air conditioners
demand more juice than California can generate or buy.
One major utility, Pacific Gas and Electric, has filed for bankruptcy
protection and a second, Southern California Edison, is on the brink of
joining it.
There is, however, a virtual energy crisis consisting of political spin,
media leaks and made-for-television buzz words -- and it is rapidly becoming
dominant, while the real situation fades into the background.
This week's comic opera proceedings before a Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission administrative judge in Washington had little to do with reality
and everything to do with the virtual version.
Gov. Gray Davis and other officials demanded $8.9 billion in refunds from the
generators and brokers who have been selling California power for the past
year, alleging that California is, in Davis' words, "being gouged and ripped
off." But the number itself was more or less plucked out of thin air -- an
arithmetic exercise by the state power grid's traffic controller not intended
for a refund proceeding. And while Judge Curtis Wagner saw it as unrealistic,
Davis and other state officials insisted on its validity.
"There are refunds due that total hundreds of millions of dollars and maybe a
billion dollars," Wagner said as a final negotiating session collapsed. But
that's a far cry from the $8.9 billion that Davis insists is due. "If you
think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds, we will see
you in court," Davis said Tuesday.
Why is Davis being so belligerent? Because it's good politics. Ever since he
began berating out-of-state generators and accusing them of ripping off
California, Davis' approval ratings have been climbing. If he settled for
substantially less -- the power generators probably would agree to a couple
of billion dollars to rid themselves of the matter -- Davis would be
embarrassed. Politically, he's served by continuing to portray himself as
fighting for California and against the out-of-state generators.
That it's more political construct than reality is indicated by another event
this week, Davis' release of state power purchase data from early in the year
-- numbers that were made public only because a judge told him he had to do
it.
Davis and his minions have been accusing Texas-based generators and power
brokers of particularly egregious price gouging -- clearly playing on
Californians' instinctive mistrust of anything Texan and implying that Texan
George W. Bush is a co-conspirator. But the power purchase records -- which
were released only to journalists willing to pay a stiff fee -- indicate that
less than 10 percent of California's power purchase dollars were going to
Texas and the private sellers, in general, charged the state less than such
publicly owned utilities as the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power.
The clearly adverse position being taken by FERC and the purchase data that
undercut his jingoistic sloganeering are not, however, deterring Davis from
continuing to operate, at least for public consumption, in the melodramatic
virtual world.
One cannot, however, ignore reality forever. The likelihood of a
pro-generator decision from FERC means that there will be no easy out for
Davis, or for his pending deal to prevent Southern California Edison from
slipping into bankruptcy court. The Legislature has refused to act on the
Edison rescue plan while it awaited an indication of whether the utility's
debts would be slimmed down by FERC.
This week's farcical events make it more likely that the Edison deal will
stall out permanently in the Legislature and its creditors will force the
utility into bankruptcy court later this summer. That's part of that nasty
old reality that cannot simply be wished away.

Energy Digest: Ratepayer panel shot down again
(Published July 11, 2001)
SAN FRANCISCO -- U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali on Tuesday reaffirmed
his earlier decision to disband a ratepayers committee that would have given
consumers an official voice in the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. bankruptcy
case.
The judge said bankruptcy court isn't the right forum for refunding rates or
settling potential future claims.
He eliminated erroneous statements from the opinion he originally issued
seven weeks ago. U.S. bankruptcy trustee Linda Ekstrom Stanley, who had moved
for reconsideration, called the new version "a very careful decision" but did
not rule out an appeal.
Stanley on May 4 appointed an official committee of ratepayers to represent
PG&E customers, saying they might be forced to pay for the utility's massive
losses.

Missing megawatts: Conservation saving state from blackouts
(Published July 11, 2001)
A public that doesn't believe that California's electricity crisis is genuine
is nonetheless acting as if it is. Experts are revising down scary
predictions of rolling blackout after rolling blackout as Californians have
opted to conserve rather than consume.
During June, Californians cut back on electricity use by roughly 4,750
megawatts when it mattered the most, on hot afternoons. Those decisions
shaved about 12 percent from the expected demand. That's equivalent to the
output of nine or 10 medium-size power plants. Last June, grid operators had
to call six shortage alerts. This June, which was hotter, they called none.
For a state that's been derided as selfish and wasteful, that's nothing short
of amazing.
Some of what Californians are doing now to conserve isn't likely to become
habit in the long run. Businesses may want to turn back on all the banks of
lights. Homeowners may decide that 82 degrees is the right temperature when
power is short but too warm when California's supply emergency is over.
Yet there's a huge potential payoff into the future if some of these changes
become permanent. It's encouraging that the most effective forms of
conservation -- switching to more energy-efficient appliances or
manufacturing techniques -- have yet to be implemented on a large scale.
Subsidies for these programs have yet to translate into changes in businesses
and in homes that will lower demand even further.
For a while this spring, some attempted to diminish the role of conservation.
Conservation is a "personal virtue," said Vice President Dick Cheney. But
Californians know it's become both a personal and public necessity. The
public may have thought the electricity shortage was an illusion, but
everyone knew that the higher electricity bills that began arriving in June
were real. And so was the risk that the lights would go out on hot days.
Yes, the state needs more supply to catch up with the growth in demand. Yet
long after the crisis is over, there will be plenty of potential on the
efficiency side of the equation as well, to protect the quality of life and
reduce the high electricity costs that will likely plague the state for years.
Governor tells FERC to be fair and then some
Davis firm on demand for $8.9 billion refund
By Ed Mendel
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
July 11, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- Gov. Gray Davis had a tough message for federal regulators
yesterday after the failure of settlement talks in California's bid to get an
$8.9 billion refund from electricity suppliers: "See you in court."
The governor said California will seek a full $8.9 billion refund for
electricity overcharges, even if federal regulators award the maximum refund
of $5.4 billion allowed under their guidelines.
"Our message is just order what you are going to order," Davis said of the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. "We believe you should order $8.9
billion. But you order what you think is fair. We will take what you order,
then we will see you in court."
Davis, joined by his negotiating team, made the remarks at a news conference
a day after two weeks of closed-door talks with suppliers in Washington
failed to reach an agreement.
An administrative law judge made a recommendation to the regulatory
commission that Davis' top negotiator, Michael Kahn, chairman of the
California Independent System Operator, expects to result in a refund of more
than $1 billion.
Davis said that a revealing decision will be made by the commission, which he
hopes has embarked on a "new path" with the appointment by President Bush of
two new members, Pat Wood of Texas and Nora Brownell of Pennsylvania.
"Are they on the side of consumers, as the federal power act envisions them
being," Davis asked, "or are they just there to do the industry's bidding, as
they have so often in the past?"
Kahn said rules adopted by FERC cut off the refund period at last October,
trimming $3 billion from the $8.9 billion overcharge claimed by California
dating to May 2000.
He said FERC has no jurisdiction over municipal utilities, such as the Los
Angeles Department of Water and Power, that sold power to the state. The
municipal districts overcharged the state by about $600 million, according to
Kahn.
As a result, he said, the maximum refund that FERC could order for California
is about $5.4 billion.
"We made it clear to everyone that if we did not settle for $8.9 billion, we
would seek redress in court for the remainder of the money above $5.4
billion," Kahn said.
Calpine of San Jose and several other generators have expressed interest in
the state's offer to negotiate one-on-one with the state while the federal
regulators consider their decision, Kahn said.
Calpine says deal with state close on alleged overcharges
By Don Thompson
ASSOCIATED PRESS
July 10, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Calpine Corp. said Tuesday it is near agreement with California
officials over money the state says the company overcharged for electricity.
That would make it the first company to settle a part of the $8.9 billion the
state wants in negotiations before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
However, San Jose-based Calpine has offered far less than the $236 million
the state claims it is owed.
"We obviously disagree with that number, because we disagree with some of the
assumptions" used for the estimate, said Calpine spokesman Bill Highlander.
"We don't think it's anywhere near that. We think it's a low number."
He wouldn't specify the company's counteroffer, but noted new FERC figures
showing the company did $29 million in business with the state in the first
five months of this year.
The California Independent System Operator estimated the company owed more in
overcharges than it had in total sales for the period from May 2000 to May
2001, a financial impossibility, Highlander said.
The ISO essentially multiplied what Calpine was able to produce by the amount
it charged for electricity, Highlander said, without taking into account how
much electricity the company actually sold.
ISO spokesman Michael Bustamante defended the projections by the state's grid
operator, estimates he said were validated during two weeks of FERC
negotiations that ended Monday. The ISO took the methodology adopted by the
federal regulator in a June 19 order capping electricity rates, then worked
backward to May 2000 to reach its estimate, Bustamante said.
Generators and state negotiators were unable to reach a settlement during the
two weeks of talks overseen by FERC chief administrative law judge Curtis L.
Wagner, leaving Wagner to make his own recommendation to the commission.
Wagner said Monday the state may be owed perhaps $1 billion in overcharges,
but said that could be offset by money the generators are owed for the power
they sold into the state.
California officials believe generators owe about $4 billion in refunds using
the June 19 order that Wagner adopted as his benchmark, even given Wagner's
determination that the commission can only consider overcharges after Oct. 2.
At one point during negotiations, Wagner told California officials he thought
an appropriate settlement should top $4.5 billion, according to one
negotiator who spoke on condition he not be named. Wagner suggested
generators could pay $2.5 billion in cash and $2 billion in long-term
electricity contracts at cheaper rates, the source said.
That was very different from the $670 million in refunds Wagner privately
said generators were offering. For instance, the source said, while Reliant
Energy on Monday offered $50 million in refunds, California believes
Reliant's share of overcharges is closer to $1 billion.
Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers,
applauded the possibility that some generators will settle with the state
without waiting for a FERC decision and likely protracted court battle.
"We need to solve this problem and move on," Smutny-Jones said.

Judge refuses to let ratepayers form official committee in utility bankruptcy
case
ASSOCIATED PRESS
July 10, 2001
SAN FRANCISCO ) The federal judge overseeing Pacific Gas and Electric Co.'s
bankruptcy case ruled Tuesday the utility's ratepayers cannot form an
official committee to represent their interests.
Ratepayer advocates had sought such recognition to ensure the utility would
not raise rates further as a way of paying off its debts.
But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali agreed with PG&E and the official
creditors committee and rejected the idea for the second time in two months.
Montali suggested instead that ratepayers organize an informal committee to
bring their concerns to the court, and said the ratepayers also could bring
matters before the state Public Utilities Commission.
A separate committee of ratepayers would have been able to vote on the final
reorganization of the company, a plan that could affect power service and
rates.
PG&E filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy April 6, and owes billions of dollars to
more than 50,000 creditors. It was brought down, in part, by California's
botched experiment with deregulation.
Judge Bars Ratepayers Panel From PG&E Case
Power: Customers are not creditors in the utility's bankruptcy, ruling says.
Action does not preclude refunds for consumers.
TIM REITERMAN
TIMES STAFF WRITER
July 11 2001
SAN FRANCISCO -- A federal judge Tuesday reaffirmed his decision to bar a
ratepayers committee from Pacific Gas & Electric Co.'s bankruptcy case and
denounced the committee's attorney for suggesting that the action could
prevent PG&E customers from receiving refunds for excessive energy charges.
Judge Dennis Montali ruled against a U.S. trustee and the ratepayers
committee in deciding that ratepayers as a group had no claims and were not
creditors when PG&E filed for bankruptcy on April 6.
But Montali criticized "misguided remarks" by a committee attorney on July 5
and news media accounts that followed the hearing. The judge said the reports
left the misconception that by disallowing a ratepayers committee, he would
reject all claims of ratepayers and they could lose out on future refunds.
The judge and PG&E officials emphasized that there are no matters involving
PG&E customer refunds before the state Public Utilities Commission.
State officials are seeking about $9 billion in refunds, however, from the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for alleged overcharges to Californians
by energy companies since last year.
The distribution of any ratepayer refunds would be decided by the PUC, and
customers would be paid whether or not they filed Bankruptcy Court claims by
a Sept. 5 deadline, the judge and PG&E attorneys said.
The judge took the highly unusual step of directing PG&E and U.S. Trustee
Linda Ekstrom Stanley to consider remedies to allay any confusion among
PG&E's 5.5 million customers.
He suggested publishing clarifications in newspapers that carried the
erroneous information, in PG&E customer bills and on Web sites.
Stanley had formed a ratepayers committee of business, government and
consumer representatives, saying they will be affected by PG&E's Chapter 11
reorganization.
But Montali decided that ratepayers do not qualify as creditors under
bankruptcy law and are not entitled to official status that allows them to
participate in the bankruptcy and receive funding from PG&E.
Stanley said she has not yet decided whether to appeal the ruling to federal
district court.

(07-11) 07:36 PDT (AP) --
Developments in California's energy crisis:
WEDNESDAY=
* No power alerts Wednesday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
TUESDAY=
* U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali again agreed with PG&E and the
official creditors committee, saying such a committee of Pacific Gas and
Electric Co. ratepayers has no legal standing in bankruptcy court. Ratepayer
advocates had sought the recognition to ensure the utility would not raise
rates further as a way of paying off its debts.
* PG&E has agreed to pay $4.1 million in tax penalties to 49 counties where
the utility owns property. The utility already paid $41.2 million in overdue
property taxes in May -- the additional amount covers a 10 percent fee for
paying those taxes late.
* Calpine Corporation says it is near agreement with California officials
over money the state says the company overcharged for electricity. That would
make it the first company to settle a portion of the $8.9 billion dollars the
state is seeking in proceedings before the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission. But the San Jose-based company is offering much less than the
$236 million dollars the state claims it is owed.
* No power alerts Tuesday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
* Shares of Edison International closed at $14.05, up 5 cents. PG&E Corp.
drop 55 cents to close at $13.55. Sempra Energy, the parent company of San
Diego Gas & Electric Co., closed at $27.67, up 15 cents.
WHAT'S NEXT=
* The Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation in
California's energy market meets Wednesday. The committee will vote on
contempt citations against generators Mirant and Enron, which failed to
comply with subpoenas for documents. The committee will meet again July 18 to
consider compliance by six other suppliers that have until Tuesday to turn
over documents.
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's
electricity crisis.
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost
nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E,
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state
lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and
natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are
refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power
for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The
state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas
& Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and
PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs.
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's
multibillion-dollar power buys.

(07-11) 09:12 PDT SACRAMENTO (AP) --
Enron Corp. is suing state officials to stop a Senate subpoena of its
financial records in a dispute over alleged overcharges for its electricity
sales to California.
"They've sent two things to Texas -- our money and these documents, and they
saying we can't get either one back," said Laurence Drivon, special legal
counsel to the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation.
The suit came hours before the committee will consider asking the full Senate
to cite the Houston-based company for contempt Wednesday. The other subject
of possible sanctions, Atlanta-based Mirant Inc., appears to be cooperating,
Drivon said.
Committee chairman Joe Dunn, a Santa Ana Democrat, said the committee's
investigation will continue despite Enron's "pure act of intimidation. We're
not going to back down."
Enron's suit said the company's financial papers are outside the committee's
jurisdiction because most of its operations and paperwork are outside
California.
That shouldn't matter, Drivon said, citing last year's successful of
out-of-state documents during the investigation into the activities of former
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. Previous investigations have
included documents subpoenaed from other nations, he said.
Companies doing business in California cannot claim immunity from its laws or
oversight, Drivon and Dunn said. Houston-based Reliant Energy made the same
argument but then agreed to turn over 1,800 documents.

Governor threatens to sue utilities for refunds
Davis says California won't settle for $1 billion

N139275.DTL
Sacramento -- One day after a federal judge rebuked California's claim that
energy generators owe the state $8.9 billion, Gov. Gray Davis all but vowed
to sue the companies to recoup the money.
"If you think California will settle for $1 billion in refunds, we'll see you
in court," Davis said yesterday.
Continuing his heated rhetoric on the energy crisis, Davis blasted the energy
companies for being inflexible during a 14-day negotiation session in
Washington, D.C., that ended Monday. Both the state and power generators
argue each is owed money as a result of California's dysfunctional
electricity market.
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission chief administrative law Judge Curtis L.
Wagner ended the talks by saying the state was owed far less than it claimed,
but the FERC's governing board will make a final decision on who owes what to
whom in the coming months.
Yesterday, Davis made it clear he wouldn't accept a FERC decision that
strayed far from the state's calculations that power companies overcharged
California nearly $9 billion.
"The ball is in the FERC's court," he said. "They must step up and provide
the refunds we've asked for."
While Davis said California officials had gone to Washington prepared to
discuss ways to reach a settlement, including renegotiating long-term
contracts to buy power, an energy industry official faulted the state for its
unwillingness to compromise.
Generators put forward an offer even though they believe no refunds are owed,
said Jan Smutny-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy
Producers.
Smutny-Jones said the state needed to stop thinking it would get the $8.9
billion.
"It's clear from the way the issue was characterized by the judge that $9
billion is not something the state is going to see any time in the near
future, " he added. "It is not based in reality."
Davis also took heat from Republicans yesterday.
"He desperately needs that refund, so he can renegotiate the dreadful
contracts he has entered into," said Rob Stutzman, a consultant for the
California Republican Party. "He's sitting at the poker table with very few
chips."
In other energy news yesterday, a judge refused to let a committee represent
the public in the Pacific Gas & Electric Co. bankruptcy case and said a
consumer lawyer's "irresponsible position" at a hearing last week could
mislead PG&E customers into filing needless refund claims with the court.
U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali said any refunds owed to customers were
unrelated to the bankruptcy case and would be determined by regulators.
At the hearing Thursday, attorney KaarenThomas argued that unless a committee
represented customers' interests, PG&E could try to bar all refund claims
that weren't filed by Sept. 5.
Montali ruled in May that the committee was not authorized by federal
bankruptcy law, and reaffirmed his ruling yesterday.

(07-11) 04:38 PDT SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) --
Energy supplier Calpine Corp. has reached a deal to purchase 236 billion
cubic feet of natural gas in Texas and New Mexico for $355 million plus
assumption of nearly $50 million of debt.
Company officials made the announcement Tuesday and said the purchase will
increase its natural gas reserves.
"This transaction meets our desire to own and operate production in a
strategic basin," said Cathy Piece, Calpine's director of land and
acquisitions. "These assets significantly strengthen our reserve base and
will help fuel our growing Western power program."
The San Jose-based company has agreed to purchase 35 wells in New Mexico that
produce 6 million cubic feet of gas per day from The Bayless Companies. The
second transaction involves the acquisition of a majority interest of Michael
Petroleum of Houston. The Texas company produces about 43 million cubic feet
of gas per day.
Calpine officials said the agreements will allow them to meet their future
capacity demands for both natural gas and electricity. The company wants to
generate more than 70,000 megawatts of electricity by the end of 2005 and
have natural gas reserves of 6.7 trillion cubic feet.
LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Newly elected Mayor James Hahn has postponed selling the
city's surplus power to the state so he can examine how it will impact
ratepayers.
Hahn's predecessor, Richard Riordan, said last month the city's Department of
Water and Power would sell its extra electricity -- about 500 megawatts a
day_ to the state at cost between July and September.
The contract was supposed to have been signed last week.
Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said Tuesday that the state
is ready to sign the contract.
"We're ready to sign," he said. "Like most negotiations that aren't final,
things go back and forth. The new (Hahn) administration wants to review the
document before it."
Davis had threatened to seize surplus power from municipal utilities, which
haven't been subjected to the California energy crisis, because he claimed
they were gouging the state.
TEMECULA, Calif. (AP) -- State officials said they are studying alternative
routes for a power transmission line proposed by San Diego Gas and Electric
Co.
The utility wants to run a 500,000-volt power line through southwestern
Riverside County connecting its power grid with Southern California Edison's.
The cost of the project is estimated at $271 million and must be approved by
the state's Public Utilities Commission.
But state officials listed alternative routes in papers released at a public
hearing Tuesday. Some of the other ideas include putting the transmission
line around the edges of an Indian reservation or running a route through the
Cleveland National Forest.
Once a final selection is made, the information will be given to PUC
commissioners who will either approve or deny the project.
Many residents who live in the path of the proposed transmission line don't
want the project. An attorney representing several groups that oppose SDG&E's
plans said there was no mention of alternative routes in environmental
documents submitted by the company.
"Looking at the various route segments offered by SDG&E as alternatives is
like trying to arrange the deck chairs on the Titanic," said attorney Mark
Mihaly.

White House bends under energy conservation pressure
Posted at 6:25 a.m. PDT Wednesday, July 11, 2001
BY H. JOSEF HEBERT
Associated Press Writer
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Under pressure to include more conservation measures that
reduce energy use, congressional Republicans are moving toward a compromise
to increase fuel efficiency requirements for sport utility vehicles as part
of an energy package.
Key House GOP lawmakers said Tuesday they expect some increase in fuel
economy requirements, especially for SUVs, in energy legislation working its
way through the House. Democrats, who have a majority in the Senate, also
favor requiring improved motor vehicle fuel efficiency.
At the same time, the Bush administration signaled its willingness Tuesday to
begin a rule-changing process that would allow the first increase in 25 years
in the federal corporate automobile fuel economy, or CAFE, standard.
Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta asked Congress to lift immediately a
six-year prohibition that bans the department from consideration of fuel
economy increases. Lawmakers already agreed this year not to extend the ban
beyond September, but Mineta said he wants to start examining possible
changes right away.
CAFE standards, which mandate fuel economy requirements for vehicle fleets,
have not been increased since their introduction in 1975. That year's law,
spurred by energy shortages in the early 1970s, required passengers cars to
meet a fleet average of at least 27.5 miles per gallon. Light trucks -- a
category that includes SUVs, vans and pickups -- have to meet a 20.7 mpg
fleet average.
With the widespread popularity of SUVs and vans in recent years, many
environmentalists have argued that the lower truck standard has compromised
the intent of the 1975 law. SUVs and vans comprise more than 40 percent of
the passenger vehicles on the road today.
As three committees began crafting energy legislation, lawmakers were
searching for a bipartisan compromise to increase fuel economy requirements
for motor vehicles. Some increase in the CAFE requirement was virtually
assured, several GOP lawmakers said, although disagreements remain on how
much of an increase, whether it should apply to automobiles as well as SUVs,
vans and small trucks, and the timetable for phasing in new requirements.
Energy legislation that the House Energy and Commerce Committee was taking up
later Wednesday contains no fuel economy provision.
But Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee chairman, said discussions were
under way to work out a compromise on a fuel economy proposal. He said he
expects an amendment on CAFE to be added to the bill, either during
deliberations in his committee or on the House floor.
Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee drafting the energy
package, saw a good chance the truck standards will be raised and said the
automobile standard might be increased as well. Other GOP sources who talked
about the private discussions on condition of not being identified by name
said a likely outcome is that the truck standard will be increased three or
four mpg and the auto standard left alone.
Momentum for some CAFE increase has been growing in recent weeks as GOP
lawmakers came under increasing pressure to come up with additional
conservation proposals to those proposed in the White House's energy policy.
It largely focuses on production, with few specific measures to dramatically
curb energy demand.
Democrats have pressed for tougher automobile fuel economy standards.
Automakers have fought attempts to increase the standards. They say such
government edicts limit consumer choice and force manufacturers to build
smaller cars that customers don't want. Supporters of increased fuel economy
argue that new technologies are available to increase fuel efficiency without
decreasing vehicle size.
President Bush's energy blueprint would consider CAFE increases, but not
before a National Academy of Sciences report is issued, probably this month,
on impact of the standard on energy savings, safety and auto industry
competition.
Davis ups the voltage
Published Wednesday, July 11, 2001, in the San Jose Mercury News
Vow to sue for refunds may be a bluff, but he should keep pushing FERC
THE strategic choice facing Gov. Gray Davis in the struggle over electricity
price refunds has come down to three questions: When do you negotiate, when
do you demand, and when do you bluff?
Negotiations are over, Davis declared Tuesday. He demanded that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission order refunds now. ``The case is nearly a year
old,'' he said. ``They have to decide which side they're on.''
Probably no one but Davis knew to what extent he was bluffing when he also
said, ``If you think California is going to settle for $1 billion in refunds,
we will see you in court.''
A FERC administrative judge said Monday that the amount due the state may be
around $1 billion, or perhaps nothing at all, when counter-claims against the
state are subtracted.
Energy experts are divided about whether the state would win a suit to
overturn a decision by a federal commission. The federal courts have some
limited jurisdiction, according to University of California Energy Institute
director Severin Borenstein, but that a court would reverse a commission in a
case like this is ``extremely unlikely.''
Frank Wolak, a Stanford economist, had the opposite view, when asked whether
the state has a good chance of winning: ``I think so. It happens all the
time.''
At a Sacramento press conference, Davis continued to insist that there have
been overcharges of $8.9 billion. But other state officials conceded that
only $5.4 billion of that is actually on the table in the FERC proceedings.
Davis said he'll take what he can get there, and sue for the rest.
The state argues that because FERC has determined that wholesale prices have
not met the Federal Power Act's requirement to be ``just and reasonable,''
refunds are in order. But the commission has not defined what portion
exceeded ``just and reasonable.''
Throughout his press conference, Davis used the prospect of litigation like a
goad to spur the federal regulators into action. But if you listened
carefully, he also indicated he'll give them more time to consider the case.
Considering the iffy odds of winning in court, we suggest he keep goading the
federal commissioners -- while giving them all the time they need.

Lights go out on Davis' power show
Three new developments show that some economic reality finally is being
applied to California's electricity crisis:
First, "The nation's chief energy judge said Monday that California is owed
maybe $1 billion in refunds from power generators, a fraction of the $8.9
billion demanded by Gov. Gray Davis," reported the Register yesterday. Even
that $1 billion amount might be balanced by the amount the state still owes
the power producers.
To suggest workable and market-oriented solutions to the California
electricity crisis.
Judge Curtis Wagner's recommendation will be taken up by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, which is being petitioned for the money by the state
of California.
Because the judge's words will bolster FERC's apparent desire not to grant
the "refunds," the state probably will go to court, where the matter could be
stuck for years.
"In the long term, this may indicate that competitive electricity has a
future even in California, but not thanks to the state," Robert Michaels, a
professor of economics at Cal State Fullerton, told us. He's referring to the
state's botched 1996 "deregulation" effort, which has been made worse by Gov.
Gray Davis and other officials since the crisis began a year ago.
"FERC since the 1980s favors competition, within the parameters of political
reality," Mr. Michaels added. "Now we're at square one: The industry doesn't
owe $9 billion to California." As this process continues, he said, another
positive aspect will be that a lot of facts will get aired. "We'll see what
has been happening in the markets" in which power is bought and sold.
Second, light already is shining on one area: This crisis was not "Made in
Texas'' by cronies of President Bush, as Gov. Davis and other Democrats have
been contending.
In May, the governor attacked the president for ignoring "the greed of these
Texas energy companies," such as Reliant and Dynergy.
In fact, according to information on state power contracts the governor
finally released Monday, Texas companies were way down on the list of
producers.
"In roughly the first five months of the year, the state shelled out $1.2
billion to Atlanta-based Mirant, the most any company was paid for
electricity, followed by $1 billion to Powerex, the marketing arm of BC Hydro
in British Columbia [in Canada]. It also paid $331 million to the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power," reported the San Jose Mercury News.
Only about 10 percent of our state's power during this period came from
companies with headquarters in Texas.
Third, and finally, a new study by the Cato Institute shows what should be
done next:
lAbolish retail rate caps, allowing prices to be set by the market.
This would be a better system than the present one, where the state buys the
electricity and passes much of the cost along through the state budget (paid
by taxpayers) and bonds paid for by long-term electricity price increases.
Higher immediate prices would encourage conservation and production, leading
in time to lower prices.
lMove to real-time pricing so people shift activities such as washing to
off-peak hours.
lAbolish the Independent System Operator, which moves electrons around.
Give this function back to the utilities, who did it far better before
"deregulation." Gov. Davis should set the pace by ending his Clintonian blame
shifting and embracing these realistic solutions.

Dear Students of the Haas School,

I am writing to let you know that I will be stepping down as Dean of the
Haas School as of December 31, 2001 after serving three and one-half
years.  I had originally intended to remain Dean through June 30, 2001. But
rather unexpectedly, I have been offered the possibility of fulfilling a
long-held dream of spending a few years in London (where my husband spent
much of his childhood) and doing so in a way that I believe will enhance my
skills as a professor and university administrator.

During the last year or so, I explored the feasibility and desirability of
forging some kind of strategic alliance between the Haas School and the
London Business School.  During my discussions and visits to London, I
became acquainted with members of the External Governing Body, the Dean's
Office and the faculty at LBS.  When the LBS Dean announced in January that
he would be departing in June, the School began an intensive international
search to replace him, and my name was added to the list.  During the last
few weeks, I have been offered this position.  After considerable
soul-searching and family discussion, I have decided to take leave from my
faculty appointment at Berkeley to accept this offer. London is an ideal
vantage point from which to study the globalization of business, and like
the Haas School, the London Business School is one of the best in the world.

During the next five months, I will remain fully committed to all of the
exciting initiatives now under way at the Haas School, including the new
Masters in Financial Engineering program, a concurrent MBA-MFE degree
option, a new Executive MBA program that has just received University
approval and will be announced in September, the expansion of the evening
MBA program to include a "Saturday" cohort, and the development of the
Initiative in Socially Responsible Business Leadership.

In addition to these programmatic initiatives, Associate Dean Ben Hermalin
and I have formed a school-wide faculty search committee to recruit for the
ten additional faculty slots for which we have received approval this
academic year.  Meetings of this committee will begin early in the fall in
order to maximize the time available for identifying and pursuing promising
candidates.  I have negotiated a special agreement with the University that
grants unprecedented autonomy in faculty retention and recruitment to the
Haas School.  Nonetheless, because of strong competition, the School
continues to face its greatest challenges in these areas.

Finally, there is the task of updating the core curriculum in the MBA and
Evening MBA programs.  Last year the faculty agreed to give me the
discretion to make a final decision on changes to the core after reviewing
both last year's MBAA student survey on the core curriculum and proposals
from interested faculty members.  I plan to make a final recommendation for
core reform in October for implementation in the 2002-2003 academic
year.  Core reform will help the School deliver the very latest and the
very best in management education.

Throughout the rest of the year, I will also continue to work with the
School's talented and committed professional staff to provide outstanding
School services to faculty, alumni, donors, recruiters, university
administrators and of course students. The quality of these services is
critical to the reputation and ranking of the Haas School.  I have worked
hard to attract and retain an outstanding staff and am proud of their many
accomplishments and of the cooperative management culture they have helped
to create.

I am also proud of the talented students of the Haas School. They are
bright, energetic, ambitious, entrepreneurial and caring. They work
together to foster a cooperative "team spirit," that is a rarity among
top-notch business schools.  And they have created and maintained some of
the most important activities at the School like the Leading Edge, Women in
Leadership and Asian Business conferences, the Berkeley Business Plan
Competition, the National Social Venture Business Plan Competition, and
many student-initiated courses and special lectures.

To the extent that I have had some successes during my tenure as Dean, I
own them to a talented and dedicated staff, a responsive central campus
administration, a first-rate faculty, loyal alumni, and outstanding
students. Thanks for making my experience in the job so meaningful. And
thanks for your commitment to the School's wellbeing.  I hope that you will
look back upon your years at Haas as among the happiest and most productive
years of your life.  I know I will.

Best of luck and make sure to stay in touch with the Haas School as loyal
alumni.


Laura D. Tyson
Dean

Many of you know Dale Furrow already.  For those who don't, he ran our structuring group in Portland from late 1997 until the middle of 1999.  He's an Army Grad, Wharton Grad, went through the Associate program and left Enron as a Director to join Entergy's Asset Development group working for Jeff Roberts.  He recently tendered his resignation at Entergy and is on the job market.  He is leaving Entergy on good terms -- he simply decided that he doesn't like working there for a variety of reasons.
Dale has a great background for many of the EES/EWS work that we are trying to do now.  He was an AWESOME structurer.  He "gets" trading.  He was responsible for the development and implementation of Entergy Power Marketing's risk systems.  In short, he would be a great catch for us.
I will be in Houston Monday and Tuesday of next week.  I will interview Dale on Tuesday.  I know that Louise and John are in PRC on Tuesday, so they would have to do it later.  Perhaps the rest of us could meet him on Tuesday.
I don't yet have a specific job nailed down for him.  I think that he could run a URM desk (east or west).  He could run the site profile, asset profile, dsm group.  I would expect that he would expect to come in at a VP level.  I know that's a high bar and hard to do here, which is why I would want this group of people to meet with him.  I have asked Debra Davidson to contact each of you to coordinate these interviews.

Davis insists on energy refunds
By David Whitney
Bee Washington Bureau
(Published June 21, 2001)
WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gray Davis demanded Wednesday that power generators refund
California nearly $9 billion in electricity charges.
"It is unconscionable for the generators to profit from their egregious
overcharges," Davis told the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.
Davis' testimony highlighted a change in political tactics in the state's
power crisis after a Monday order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
expanding wholesale price relief for California and 10 other Western states.
And the governor got some support from two FERC members who said Wednesday
that they are prepared to order California's energy suppliers to make heavy
refunds because of overcharging.
But the two commissioners -- Pat Wood III and William Massey -- agreed with
their FERC colleagues that California officials and energy companies should
be given a chance to settle the multibillion-dollar refund dispute in the
next three weeks before the commission acts, the Washington Post reported.
During his testimony, Davis gave tepid praise to FERC, which he said "finally
took a positive step" in imposing the limits. But he continued to press the
independent agency to recover what he said were overcharges.
"The FERC has been on a sit-down strike ... because we haven't received a
dime," Davis said.
The commission's action on price controls has been well-received, diminishing
appeals among West Coast Democratic governors and lawmakers and a handful of
Republicans for congressionally mandated caps.
But the commission's order didn't quiet demands that generators be required
to pay back overcharges, and Davis led the charge Wednesday to exploit that
issue.
Davis said the California Independent System Operator, the Folsom-based
agency that manages the state's power grid, found the state was billed $8.9
billion more than the competitive market would have warranted for power
deliveries for the 13 months ending June 1.
Davis insisted that FERC move promptly to "order the energy companies to give
back the money," and that Congress should help pressure the agency to do so.
"I do believe that FERC should get a clear signal on refunds from this
committee," Davis told the Democrat-controlled panel during a hearing into
whether FERC has responded properly to the crisis.
The energy commission has ordered reviews of about $124 million in potential
overcharges in the past several months. But that amount is dwarfed by the
$8.9 billion that Davis is now seeking in refunds.
While the commission is continuing to review possible overcharges, it has yet
to order a single dollar in refunds. The power generators deny they have
overcharged California, saying market conditions and the utilities' shaky
credit ratings warranted high prices.
Wood and Massey, who talked to the Post after their testimony Wednesday
before the committee, said they are ready to require generators and marketers
to refund revenue that exceeded the price ceilings imposed by FERC on Monday.
"We should have given (the California parties) guidance on refunds," Massey
told the Post. "A good place to start was to take (Monday's) order and apply
it starting October 2000 and see what you get" in refunds.
Depending on the time period and whether private generators and municipal
utilities would be required to pay, the refunds could exceed $1 billion, some
energy attorneys calculated Wednesday.
In its Monday order, the commission said it wanted all the parties to sit
down with an administrative law judge to see if they could work out a refunds
settlement. The settlement conference begins Monday.
Commission Chairman Curt Hebert told the Senate panel at Wednesday's hearing
that if no deal is reached after three weeks, the commission would seek
advice from the judge on how it might order a resolution.
"The commission stands ready to act expeditiously," Hebert pledged.
While Davis took the offensive at Wednesday's hearing, Republicans didn't
give him a free ride. The Republican National Committee passed out hand fans
touted as "Gray Davis' solution for summer blackouts."
The fans were paid for by a small Sacramento Republican consulting firm, MB
Associates.
The questioning by the committee's chairman, Sen. Joe Lieberman of
Connecticut, and other Democrats was friendly. But Republicans tried to paint
Davis as the culprit in a crisis he could have solved a year ago.
"How did you let things get totally out of hand?" asked Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's senior Republican.
Davis said his administration began the push to build new generating plants
to meet the impending power shortage four months after he took office in
1999.
"I make no apologies for the aggressive actions we've taken," the governor
said.
Republican lawmakers warned that demanding refunds could actually add to
California's power woes if energy investors become spooked about sanctions
and take their business elsewhere -- resulting in a decreased electricity
supply.
Under pointed questioning from Thompson, Davis shot back.
"The people I represent are mad. They want us to fight back," Davis said.
"... Obviously, we want the state to be an attractive place for investment.
But we don't want companies walking all over our citizens."
Separately, the top Republican on the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources
Committee said it was unrealistic -- and perhaps unfair -- for Davis to
expect FERC to immediately order refunds.
"They're going to have to go back to court and prove these charges that,
indeed, there was manipulation in the marketing of power. And that's going to
be very difficult to do," said Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska.
Even if a refund deal is reached, it's uncertain how much of an effect it
might have. Of the $8.9 billion identified by the ISO, roughly two-thirds of
that was incurred by California utilities that still owe generators billions
of dollars for past power deliveries.
Hebert also noted that ratepayers in other Western states would have to be
included in refund considerations.
Meanwhile, Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Gordon Smith, R-Ore., said
Wednesday that because of FERC's action, they were pulling back their bill,
at least for now, to require that wholesale prices in the West be set at the
cost of production, plant by plant, plus a margin of profit.
However, House Democrats said that while they were happy the commission had
taken action, they still want a vote on a tougher price-cap proposal offered
by Democratic Reps. Jay Inslee of Washington and Nancy Pelosi of San
Francisco.

Energy Digest: State moves to tax plants


(Published June 21, 2001)
In a move aimed at squeezing more tax revenue from large in-state power
generators, the state Board of Equalization on Wednesday edged closer to
stripping local governments of their authority to tax power plants.
State Controller Kathleen Connell, a member of the board, proposed that the
state take over the assessments.
The amount local governments may assess power plants is limited by
Proposition 13, but the state is able to place higher values on the
properties.
Supporters of the move say the state could collect $70 million to $100
million more than local governments.
But the board's staff, while acknowledging that the state could extract more
from power plants than local governments during the current energy crisis,
said it is unclear what would happen to the price of power and value of power
plants in the future.
Local governments, worried that the new assessment system could shortchange
their revenues, opposed the move. But the board, which voted unanimously to
give the plan tentative approval, said the Legislature intends to distribute
the power plant money as though it were taxed locally.
Plants producing fewer than 50 megawatts and co-generation facilities would
be exempted from the rule change. The bill closely resembles AB 81 by
Assemblywoman Carole Migden, D-San Francisco, which has been approved by the
Assembly and awaits Senate action.

Davis demands nearly $9 billion for electricity overcharges



By H. Josef Hebert
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 20, 2001
WASHINGTON ) California Gov. Gray Davis demanded that power generators refund
nearly $9 billion in electricity overcharges and complained that federal
regulators have "looked the other way while energy companies bilked our
state."
Davis told a Senate hearing Wednesday that the decision by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission to curtail price spikes in California and 10 other
Western states was a step forward. "But its actions do nothing about the
overcharges" over the past year, he said.
The governor, a Democrat, has been criticized by Republicans, who charge he
has allowed the California power crisis to get out of hand.

Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis




Davis defended his actions, saying the state has stepped up approval for new
power plants and strengthened conservation programs. He also said the state
has little control over price gouging by out-of-state power generators.
"The governor once said he could solve California's problems in 15 minutes.
... But it appears that California has continued to try and hide the true
cost of power by having the state pay for it instead of the utilities,"
putting California taxpayers in jeopardy, said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska.
Murkowski said many of the alleged overcharges are by public power entities
not under FERC jurisdiction
Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn., chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee,
said the FERC, which regulates wholesale electricity sales, has been slow to
respond and "surprisingly reluctant" to assure that electricity prices are
just and reasonable, as required by the 1934 Federal Power Act.
The agency's response to the Western power problem "raises serious questions
about whether (FERC) has or will oversee the newly deregulated energy
markets" not only in the West but across the rest of the country.
The federal agency, whose commissioners were to testify later in the day,
imposed limited, market-based price caps on Monday in California and 10 other
Western states from Washington to Arizona. The agency also ordered the
parties to attend a conference next week to try to work out agreements on
overcharges and other issues.
Months ago, the FERC singled out $124 million in alleged overcharges by power
generators. The power companies have since challenged the agency's findings
and the matter remains in dispute.
"To date not a single penny in refunds has been returned to California,"
complained Davis. He said that between May 2000 and the beginning of this
month power generators are believed to have overcharged California $8.9
billion.
"They must be required to give us back our money," said Davis. "It is
unconscionable that FERC looked the other way while energy companies bilked
our state for up to $9 billion."
The state spent $7 billion for electricity in 1999 and $27 billion in 2000
and is projected to pay nearly $50 billion this year, said Davis. "Power
generators have been able to exert extreme power over our energy market," he
said.
Davis rejected Republican criticism that the state is not addressing the
problem. He said newly approved power plants will provide 20,000 additional
megawatts of electricity by 2003, including 4,000 megawatts by the end of
this summer. "Everything that can be done to bring reliable, affordable
energy to California is being done ... except wholesale price relief," he
said.
"This administration has minimized this crisis (for) more months," said Sen.
Patty Murray, D-Wash., alluding to President Bush's repeated refusal to urge
the FERC to mitigate electricity prices. Bush has strongly opposed price
controls, although he indicated support for FERC's limited price mitigation
effort this week.
Murray said the government should issue a disaster declaration so that
businesses can get low-income loans, and require that FERC press its
investigation into price gouging and demand refunds not only in California
but in the Pacific Northwest, where electricity prices have also skyrocketed.
Republicans continued their opposition to more stringent price caps based on
the cost of generation at individual power plants.
"Having a federal agency try to determine what is a just and reasonable price
is laughable," said Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the committee's ranking
Republican. Hard price caps "don't work when supply is the problem. ... They
make a bad situation worse," he said.
After FERC issued its limited price control order this week, Senate Democrats
on Tuesday said they would drop legislation to require more stringent
cost-based price caps on Western electricity sales.
Democrats in the House, however, said they would continue to pursue a bill
requiring the FERC to take more aggressive action.




Davis spars with GOP senators over electricity rates



By Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 20, 2001
WASHINGTON ) California Gov. Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans
Wednesday as he blamed federal regulators for averting their gaze from an
alleged $9 billion scheme to bilk the state's electricity consumers.
Testifying in front of the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Davis
demanded that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) order power
companies to refund the overcharges. But the governor also found himself
obliged to ward off GOP claims that Davis' own policies triggered the state's
energy crisis.
The partisan give-and-take reflected the mounting political stakes involved
in California's plight. With both parties preparing for next year's
congressional elections, the subtext of Davis' testimony appeared to involve
a recognition that the state's energy problems could affect the outcome of
several California races.
"How did you let things get so totally out of hand?" asked Sen. Fred Thompson
of Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, as he greeted Davis who
made a long-awaited appearance here after weeks of transcontinental sniping
over assigning responsibility for the state's energy woes.
Thompson's question could have been lifted from the script of a $1.5 million
GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that
attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis.
Davis' rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power
on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation.
"We've been working on this for a very long time, and to suggest otherwise
would be inaccurate," he told Thompson.
Saying that he is determined to hold "FERC's feet to the fire" on the refund
issue, Davis complained to the committee, "It is unconscionable that the
commission looked the other way while energy companies bilked our state for
up to $9 billion."
Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground with
California voters since the electricity crisis hit, but Wednesday's round of
activities here found him on the offensive.
"Obviously, this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him,"
observed Norm Ornstein, a congressional affairs expert at the American
Enterprise Institute.
Several hours after Davis completed his testimony, the five FERC
commissioners appeared before the committee, but they largely ignored the
governor's accusations.
On Monday, FERC issued an order restricting energy prices in California and
much of the West for the next 15 months and setting up a procedure for
reviewing refund claims.
"The commission is not ducking these issues," said FERC Chairman Curtis L.
Hebert.
However, there remains a substantial gap between Davis' calculation of
electricity overcharges in California and the $124.5 million in refunds
assessed so far by FERC.
The struggle over refunds will enter a new phase on Monday when the review
procedure outlined by FERC will begin before FERC's chief administrative law
judge, Curtis L. Wagner Jr. Pairing off against the power companies will be
senior officials of the Independent System Operator, which runs the state's
power grid.
Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the $9 billion
estimate of California's electricity overcharge.
"To date, not a single penny has been returned to Californians," Davis told
the committee. "It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep
these egregious overcharges."
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gouging,
and Davis said later he would anticipate "some strong action coming out of
his office before the end of the summer."
Davis expects to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bush's two new FERC GOP
appointees, Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell, about "natural gas discrepancies"
in California.
"California was paying two to three times more in natural gas, and the
president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed," Davis told a
press conference after meeting with the California congressional delegation.
Reps. Duncan Hunter, R-El Cajon, and Darrell Issa, R-Vista, were among the
Republicans who met with Davis.
"It was a good meeting with the governor," Hunter said, adding that FERC "has
taken steps to lock down prices, and the results speak for themselves. I
think we are all working together, and it's a good sense of common ground."
That was not the mood in the committee hearing, however.
Sparring with Davis, Thompson argued that there had been ample advance
warnings of the crisis, including a 1998 report foreseeing an imminent energy
shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of
economic growth spurred by the energy-intensive high-tech industry.
"Did you see those developments?" Thompson asked. "Did they cause you
concern?"
Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor, Gov. Pete Wilson,
and the State Legislature that designed an energy deregulation plan now
widely recognized as having been seriously flawed.
However, he said those problems did not become apparent until last year.
Thompson also criticized Davis' recent rhetoric castigating the power
companies for price gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by
dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the state's
power infrastructure.
"The people I represent are mad," replied Davis. "They want us to fight back
and that's what I'm doing."
He said he is determined that the state cease serving as "a cash cow to a lot
of energy companies."





Poway not proceeding on power plant proposal



Council worried about financial burden
By Brian E. Clark
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
POWAY -- Citing financial risks, the City Council has pulled the plug on a
proposed $40 million power plant in the South Poway Business Park.
Though there was no formal vote, Mayor Mickey Cafagna told City Manager Jim
Bowersox -- who was lukewarm at best to the proposed plant -- that his staff
should not spend any more time or money on the project.
So-called "peaker" plants are small, less-efficient plants that can produce
up to 50 megawatts of electricity. Usually they run only several hours a day,
when demand is greatest.
At the council meeting Tuesday night, Cafagna said he saw little reason to
invest in the plant, especially since there are no guarantees that Poway
could claim any of the power it produced.
Instead, he said the city should monitor a plan put forth by Rep. Duncan
Hunter, R-El Cajon, that would coordinate the use of diesel generators owned
by large businesses to help avoid the blackouts that are expected to plague
the state this summer.
If the council had chosen to proceed with the peaker-plant proposal -- an
idea it first explored in March -- it would have had to pay San Diego Gas &
Electric Co. up to $30,000 to go through the application process. An
additional $70,000 would have been authorized for a consultant.
Those two figures made City Council members blanch.
"I'm not willing to commit any of the public's money on this," said
Councilwoman Betty Rexford. "I think it would be better for the city to be
handing out energy-efficient light bulbs to save energy."




Campaign helps seniors bear summer



Program to use stickers identifying 'cool zones'
By Anne Krueger
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
During a heat wave or rolling blackout this summer, look to the polar bear
for relief.
The bear is on a decal that will be placed at the entrances of about 60
buildings around San Diego County that have been designated as "cool zones."
The program kicks off today, the first day of summer.
The cool zones were the idea of Supervisor Dianne Jacob. She was looking for
a way to offer relief to seniors and the disabled who are particularly
vulnerable to heat exhaustion and dehydration.
Jacob said she was concerned that many seniors might not use their air
conditioners this summer because of high electric bills. Or they would have
to suffer through a power outage during a rolling blackout.
She said she wants to avoid a disaster like the one in Chicago in 1995. More
than 500 residents, most of them elderly, died when the power went out during
a heat wave.
The buildings identified as cool zones include senior centers, libraries,
enclosed shopping malls, and even courthouses. Some of the cool zones, such
as senior centers or libraries, may have planned programs, but other
buildings will simply provide a place to get out of the heat.
"If people want to read on their own or knit or chat, at least there will be
places for them to cool off," said Denise Nelesen, spokeswoman for the county
Office of Aging and Independence Services, which is coordinating the program.
Many of the buildings designated as cool zones are popular spots already. At
Parkway Plaza in El Cajon, 79-year-old William Richards of North Park sat on
a bench sipping a soda. He said that although he lives closer to Fashion
Valley, an outdoor mall in Mission Valley, he prefers Parkway Plaza, in part,
because it's enclosed.
"It's more comfortable," Richards said. "It's just a nice place to walk
around."
The Lemon Grove Senior Center is getting a polar bear sticker, too. Even
without the air-conditioning turned on. Officials there are prudently waiting
for the heat to hit before flipping the switch.
A group of women played mah-jongg there Tuesday as a breeze came through the
open door. "We'll be glad to share our space, if it's cool," said Eve Butler.
Jacob said providing transportation to cool zones is still a problem that
hasn't been worked out. She said money may be available through the state
Public Utilities Commission.
Nelesen said the county also is helping shut-in seniors through its Project
Care program, in which the seniors receive a regular phone call to check on
their welfare. Mail carriers and utility workers are being trained to look
for signs that a senior may require assistance, Nelesen said.




Business leaders unite to back new SDG&E line



Coalition to lobby for transmission plan
By Jeff McDonald
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 21, 2001
A group of San Diego business leaders have formed a coalition to promote a
major improvement to the San Diego Gas & Electric transmission grid.
The utility is seeking approval for a 500,000-volt transmission line that
would run from southwest Riverside County to north San Diego County. SDG&E
hopes to have the so-called Valley Rainbow Interconnect in place by 2004.
San Diego business executives plan to lobby state energy regulators to
approve the 30-mile set of looming poles and high-voltage wires in order to
boost capacity along the SDG&E transmission network.
"The Valley Rainbow Interconnect will ensure a reliable delivery of power for
San Diegans for years to come," said Jessie Knight Jr. of the San Diego
Regional Chamber of Commerce.
The collection of business leaders includes chamber officials as well as
executives of the San Diego-Imperial Counties Labor Council and the San Diego
Economic Development Corp.
Calling themselves the San Diego County Valley Rainbow Alliance, members plan
to testify at California Public Utilities Commission meetings on behalf of
the project.
Three community hearings have been scheduled by the CPUC to solicit input on
the proposal from residents of San Diego and Riverside counties. They were
scheduled in Pauma Valley and the Riverside County communities of Winchester
and Temecula.
No organized opposition to the network has surfaced in San Diego County.
But a group of Temecula Valley area residents have spent months fighting the
project. Among other things, they worry about the effect that the
long-planned series of 190-foot poles might have on their property values.
The CPUC held a hearing last night at the Pauma Valley Community Center.
Another hearing on the application will be held at 6:30 tonight at the
Temecula Community Recreation Center.

Governor adamant on refund at hearing



Davis, on Capitol Hill visit, deflects blame for shortages
Finlay Lewis and Joe Cantlupe
COPLEY NEWS SERVICE
June 21, 2001
WASHINGTON -- Gov. Gray Davis sparred with Senate Republicans yesterday as he
blamed federal regulators for ignoring what he said was a $9 billion scheme
by power companies to bilk Californians.
Testifying before the Senate's Government Affairs Committee, Davis demanded
that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission order power companies to refund
the overcharges.
But the governor was forced to respond to Republican claims that his policies
turned a solveable problem into a full-blown energy crisis.
The partisan give-and-take reflected the mounting political stakes involved
in California's plight. The subtext of Davis' testimony involved a
recognition that the state's energy problems could affect the outcome of
several California House races next year, as well as the governor's own
re-election.
"How did you let things get so totally out of hand?" Sen. Fred Thompson of
Tennessee, the committee's ranking Republican, asked Davis.
Thompson's question could have been lifted from the script of a $1.5 million
GOP advertising campaign launched earlier this week in California that
attempts to put the governor on the spot for the energy crisis. The campaign
follows weeks of criticism by Davis of federal regulators and of President
Bush for failing to address the energy problem.
Davis' rebuttal involved a long recitation of his moves to bring more power
on line in the state and to encourage greater conservation.
"We've been working on this for a very long time, and to suggest otherwise
would be inaccurate," he told Thompson.
The Democratic governor said he is determined to hold "FERC's feet to the
fire" on the refund issue.
"It is unconscionable that the commission looked the other way while energy
companies bilked our state for up to $9 billion," he said.
Davis' grievances received more attention here than they might have just
weeks ago, before Democrats took control of the Senate and its committees
after Sen. Jim Jeffords of Vermont bolted the Republican Party to become an
independent. A sympathetic committee chairman, Democratic Sen. Joe Lieberman
of Connecticut, made Davis the star witness of yesterday's hearing.
Recent public opinion polls show that Davis has lost substantial ground with
California voters since the electricity crisis hit, but Republicans have
acknowledged that Davis and Democrats in recent weeks have gained the upper
hand over the Bush administration in the energy debate.
Despite some GOP criticism yesterday, Davis was clearly on the offensive.
"Obviously, this is the equivalent of a political nuclear weapon for him,"
observed Norm Ornstein, a congressional affairs expert at the American
Enterprise Institute.
Several hours after Davis completed his testimony, the five FERC
commissioners appeared before the committee, but they largely ignored the
governor's accusations.
On Monday, FERC issued an order to control energy prices in California and
much of the West for the next 15 months and to set up a procedure for
reviewing refund claims.
"The commission is not ducking these issues," said FERC Chairman Curtis
Hebert.
However, there remains a substantial gap between Davis' calculation of
electricity overcharges in California and the $124.5 million in refunds
assessed so far by FERC, which have been contested by power generators.
The struggle over refunds enters a new phase Monday when the review procedure
outlined by FERC will begin before the commission's chief administrative law
judge, Curtis Wagner Jr. Facing off against the power companies will be
senior officials of the Independent System Operator, which runs the
California power grid.
Davis told reporters that it was the ISO that produced the $9 billion
estimate of California's electricity overcharge.
"To date, not a single penny has been returned to Californians," Davis told
the committee. "It is unconscionable that the generators be allowed to keep
these egregious overcharges."
Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., yesterday introduced legislation to provide for
refunds.
The power companies, although acknowledging huge profits, have denied
allegations of price gouging or market manipulation.
"There has been no evidence to suggest that suppliers bilked anyone," Mark
Stultz, a vice president of the Electric Power Supply Association, told the
Associated Press.
California Attorney General Bill Lockyer is reviewing possible price gouging,
and Davis said after the hearing he anticipated "some strong action" from
Lockyer in the next few months.
Davis said he plans to meet on Monday in Sacramento with Bush's two new FERC
appointees, Pat Wood III and Nora Brownell, about "natural gas discrepancies"
in California. Davis said California has been paying up to three times more
for natural gas than elsewhere in the country.
"The president agreed with me this is something that could be fixed," Davis
told a reporters after meeting with the California congressional delegation.
Reps. Duncan Hunter of El Cajon and Darrell Issa of Vista were among the
Republicans who met with Davis.
"It was a good meeting with the governor," Hunter said, adding that FERC "has
taken steps to lock down prices, and the results speak for themselves. I
think we are all working together, and it's a good sense of common ground."
That was not the mood in the committee hearing, however.
Sparring with Davis, Thompson argued that there had been ample advance
warnings of the crisis. He noted a 1998 report forecasting an imminent energy
shortage and the fact that the state was undergoing a rapid period of
economic growth spurred by the energy-intensive high-tech industry.
"Did you see those developments?" Thompson asked. "Did they cause you
concern?"
Davis sought to shift the focus back to his predecessor, Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson, and the state Legislature, which approved an energy deregulation plan
now widely recognized as seriously flawed.
However, he said those problems did not become apparent until last year.
Thompson also criticized Davis' recent rhetoric castigating the power
companies for price-gouging and suggested that the tactic could backfire by
dissuading the energy sector from making needed investments in the state's
power infrastructure.
"The people I represent are mad," replied Davis. "They want us to fight back
and that's what I'm doing."
He said he is determined that the state cease serving as "a cash cow to a lot
of energy companies."





Little-known transmission company has billion-dollar backers



By Jennifer Coleman
ASSOCIATED PRESS
June 20, 2001
SACRAMENTO ) Through an alliance with a little-known start-up company,
General Electric Co. is trying to enter California's transmission lines
business.
Although Trans-Elect, a two-year-old company based in Washington, has no
experience in the transmission business, it has the financial support of GE's
$66 billion financial arm, GE Capital. Trans-Elect's latest offer comes as
Gov. Gray Davis seeks legislative approval for his plan to buy the
transmission lines of both San Diego Gas & Electric and Southern California
Edison.
Any involvement by GE in the state's transmission grid could be a conflict of
interest, said a key lawmaker involved in the efforts to end California's
yearlong power crisis.
"You've got someone with generation and transmission systems, how do they
keep them separate and do they?" said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Boulder
Creek. "That's a concern for me. Would they have the ability to restrict
competitors' access to transmissions?"
Trans-Elect first made overtures to buy the transmission lines in February,
offering more than $5 billion for those owned by SDG&E, Edison and Pacific
Gas and Electric.
Although Davis has reached a deal with Edison to buy their lines for $2.76
billion and a $1 billion pact with SDG&E, Trans-Elect has said it will offer
Edison $1.8 billion and SDG&E $700 million.
Bob Mitchell, Trans-Elect's vice president, said the company made its offer
believing that the Legislature won't approve the deals to buy the two
utilities' lines.
GE joined forces with Trans-Elect March 14, when GE Capital Services
Structured Finances Group Inc. announced it had bought a minority stake in
the company. Neither company would reveal the size of the investment.
But a GE statement said its investment enables "GE Capital Global Energy to
co-invest with Trans-Elect as it acquires transmission assets throughout the
U.S."
Now, however, both GE and Trans-Elect are trying to downplay their
relationship.
Ken Koprowski, a GE spokesman, said the company made "a small financial
investment and we're not involved in the management of the company." He added
that the company invests in many other energy projects, including power
plants.
"There's no connection with what we're doing in California and GE," Mitchell
said.
What Koprowski and Mitchell call a low-profile arrangement has generated
lobbying activity. Several lawmakers said they had met with Mitchell about
Trans-Elect's offer.
GE Capital hired lobbyist Phillip Schott a week after investing in
Trans-Elect. Schott referred calls to GE's lobbyist, Kahl/Pownall Advocates,
one of California's biggest political lobbying firms. Fred Pownall,
Kahl/Pownall's head, referred all questions on the bill to GE Capital
headquarters.
In California, many hurdles remain for Trans-Elect. First, the Legislature
would have to kill the deals with SDG&E and Edison. Then the companies would
have to turn to Trans-Elect to buy their lines.
So far, utility leaders are skeptical. Edison CEO John Bryson rejected the
Trans-Elect offer Tuesday, calling it a "phony" bid by an unknown company.
"We don't know this company. I suppose nobody does," Bryson said at a town
hall meeting in Los Angeles. The reason the transmission lines are in the
deal "is that we consider it our responsibility to try to stay serving our
customers as a healthy utility."
Other than the governor's offer, the transmission system isn't for sale,
Bryson said.
Trans-Elect remains interested in investing in California, but has postponed
sending a letter offering $1.8 billion for Edison's lines, Mitchell said.
"I think it's potentially an attractive deal, when we can create the right
climate for it," Mitchell said. "From the perspective of the people of
California, it's one less financial obligation they have to take on."
The Memorandum of Understanding between Edison and the governor needs
legislative approval by August, and many lawmakers have balked at the plan.
Keeley said he isn't convinced that selling the assets to a private company
is the best long-term solution for the state.
"I'm not prepared at this stage to believe that we should sell something as
significant as the transmission system to an entity that is not regulated by
the state and where our ability to have anything to say about the
transmission system is in the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's venue,"
he said.
Should the Davis plan fail, Mitchell says his offer would remain.
"It appears to me and many other people that the Legislature is not going to
allow the people of California to pay an excessively high price," he said.
The $1.8 billion offer is "a very strong price."
Mitchell said he doesn't blame the utilities for rejecting his initial
offers, since the governor has promised more. But he stressed that the
company has a future in the industry, and plans to go public eventually.
Formed in 1998, Trans-Elect is trying to be the country's first national
transmission company. As utilities deregulate, they are allowed to sell
assets, including the transmission lines.
The American Transmission Company, a private transmission company based in
Wisconsin, has a similar mission as Trans-Elect, but not the level of
financial backing, said ATC spokeswoman Maripat Blankenheim.
"They're out there out with a really big check book," she said.




Davis Asks for Energy Refund Help
Power: Governor urges U.S. Senate action to get "back the money that was
wrongly taken from us."

By RICHARD SIMON, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON--California Gov. Gray Davis, seeking to shift the focus of
the energy debate, urged Congress on Wednesday to turn up the political heat
on federal regulators to help California recover $9 billion in estimated
overcharges by power generators.
Davis told a Senate panel that the order issued Monday by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission to limit Western electricity prices was "a step
in the right direction." But more aggressive action is needed, he said, to
"give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us."




Gov. Gray Davis wipes his brow outside the Capitol after discussing his
remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.

Davis' remarks to the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee suggest that
the political warfare between Sacramento and Washington did not end with
FERC's decision to police wholesale electricity prices more aggressively.
By demanding federal intervention to recover money already paid to power
generators, Davis continued to insist that the Bush administration and
federal regulators must share responsibility for solving the state's energy
problems.
"Yes, they have provided some relief," Davis said of FERC's price
mitigation mandate. "But that's only half the job. The other half of the job
is give us back the money that was wrongly taken from us."
On his first trip to Capitol Hill since Democrats took control of the
Senate, Davis appeared before a Governmental Affairs Committee that displayed
more sympathy toward his administration than it did when Republicans ruled it.
One committee member, fellow Democrat Robert Torricelli of New Jersey,
bluntly warned FERC: "We are watching how the people of California are
treated, and we are watching very, very closely."
Davis noted that federal regulators have already determined that
wholesale power rates charged to California were "unjust and unreasonable."
Even so, he said, "not a single penny in refunds has been returned to
California."

Governor Calls Rates 'Egregious'
"It's unconscionable if generators are allowed to keep these egregious
overcharges," Davis said, imploring the committee to "hold FERC's feet to the
fire."
California's electricity grid operator has calculated that the state
paid about $9 billion more than a competitive market would warrant for
electricity from May 2000 to May 2001. So far, FERC has only identified about
$124 million in possible overcharges, which were confined to January and
February.
To some extent, FERC has already agreed to play a bigger role in seeking
refunds, although not necessarily the full $9 billion that Davis is seeking.
Next week, representatives of the state, electric utilities and power
generating companies are scheduled to begin talks in Washington on possible
refunds.




California Gov. Gray Davis testifies before a Senate committee. He implored
its members to "hold FERC's feet to the fire." AFP

The settlement conference, which begins Monday, is scheduled to run for
15 consecutive days, including weekends, which is unusual for a regulatory
proceeding.
Presiding over the conference will be Chief Administrative Law Judge
Curtis L. Wagner Jr., who admonished participants Wednesday to make sure that
they send representatives who have authority to approve any agreements
reached during the negotiations. Wagner can extend the conference if
necessary.
The purpose of the conference is to settle past accounts and structure
"new arrangements for California's energy future," Wagner said in a
scheduling order. To reach those goals, the parties must agree on how much of
the electricity load will be shifted away from the volatile spot market for
immediate delivery into stable, long-term contracts, refunds and
"credit-worthiness matters," the order said.
Edison General Counsel Stephen E. Pickett said the utility is pleased
that regulators set up the meeting with power generators to discuss refunds
to the utilities dating back to Oct. 2.
"Certainly, it is a positive step toward resolving many of these
issues," Pickett said in a conference call Tuesday with creditors.
San Diego Gas & Electric expressed similar muted optimism.
"SDG&E has been a supporter of customer refunds, and we're encouraged
that the FERC is working toward a settlement," SDG&E spokesman Art Larson
said.
But Reliant Energy spokeswoman Pat Hammond expressed skepticism about
the $9-billion overcharge figure cited by Davis. "That number sounds like the
price of all the power they've bought in the last year in California, and we
obviously don't feel that is owed" by Reliant and other power producers.
Donato Eassey, a Houston-based energy analyst for Merrill Lynch, said he
expects the FERC-mediated conference to produce a compromise in which all
parties--generators, utilities and consumers--get "a haircut." But that
outcome, he suggested, might beat the alternatives.
"You've got to put this problem behind you," he said, "because if you
don't, you'll have a problem of biblical proportions."

FERC Members Also Before Senate Panel
Adding to the pressure for refunds, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.)
introduced a bill Wednesday that would require FERC to order rebates if
federal regulators determine that prices charged were "unjust and
unreasonable."
The five members of FERC's governing board also appeared Wednesday
before the Senate panel but were scheduled later in the day to avoid a public
confrontation with Davis.
The governor met privately Wednesday with two new board members,
including Patrick H. Wood III, a Bush ally from Texas who, according to
Davis, has indicated a "more aggressive approach to refunds might be in
order."
Still, there was no shortage of partisanship at the committee hearing.
Republican aides passed out hand-held fans bearing the inscription:
"Gray Davis' solution for summer blackouts." Davis handed out a slick
177-page book detailing steps his administration has taken to ease the power
crunch. The Bush administration issued a Department of Energy study asserting
that California would face twice as many rolling blackouts if hard price caps
were imposed on wholesale electricity.
Davis did not escape a scolding from Republican senators for his
criticism of the Bush administration's refusal to impose firm price controls.
Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) pointedly asked Davis "how he let things
get totally out of hand" and excoriated the governor for assigning blame for
the state's problems to the Bush administration, federal regulators, former
Gov. Pete Wilson and various "corporate pirates." He also faulted Davis for
not acting sooner to pass on higher wholesale costs to consumers.
"If I passed on a 700% increase to the citizens of California, there
would be an outrage the likes of which you have never seen," Davis responded.
Republican senators also challenged Davis on how he hopes to stimulate
more power plant construction in California if state officials continue to
attack generating companies. They noted that the state attorney general even
suggested that the chairman of one power company deserved to be locked in a
cell with an amorous inmate named Spike.
"This is a rough business," Davis responded. "The people I represent are
mad."
He also told his Republican critics: "If you were in my shoes and facing
the extraordinary price increases, you would feel as I do. Our first
obligation is to fight back."
Davis urged the committee to keep pressure on FERC to rein in natural
gas prices, which until recently have been as much as eight times higher than
the national average.
FERC Chairman Curtis L. Hebert Jr. assured the committee that his agency
is aggressively pursuing remedies to California's energy price spikes and
supply shortages. "We have been engaged," he said, citing more than 60 orders
issued by the agency to address the power crisis.
Commissioner William L. Massey, a Democrat who has urged stronger
federal intervention in the electricity markets, said he regrets the
commission did not act sooner.
"Businesses have closed down, putting thousands out of work and hurting
the Western economy, and all because of a broken electricity market," he
said. "By acting 10 months ago, we could have prevented much of the economic
carnage."
Despite the tensions, Davis elicited some sympathy from even his
Republican critics.
"I wouldn't wish your problems on my worst enemy," Thompson told Davis.

House Approves Utility Aid for Needy
Congress: Bill would add $300 million to program that helps families pay
their bills. Strict price caps are blocked.

By JANET HOOK, Times Staff Writer

WASHINGTON--In its first direct legislative response to the nation's
burgeoning energy crisis, the House on Wednesday approved legislation that
would provide an additional $300 million to help low-income families pay
their power bills.
The bill amounts to a midyear increase of 21% for the $1.4-billion
energy assistance program--twice as much as President Bush had proposed
adding to help the poor cope with increases in utility bills.
Before final action on the bill, House Republican leaders blocked
Democratic efforts to force votes on a broader response to the energy crisis
in the West: strict energy price caps that reach beyond the restraints
imposed Monday by federal regulators.
Republicans argued that price caps would not solve California's energy
problem, while Democrats accused the GOP of being cavalier about the crisis
faced by consumers.
"This says to the people of the West, 'Your emergency doesn't count to
us,' " said Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco).
But such assertions were countered by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas), who said: "Members should reject the siren song of price caps and
remember this: Government price controls will mean more blackouts."
The issue erupted during debate on a $6.5-billion midyear appropriation
bill to cover unanticipated costs and emergency expenditures, including $5.5
billion for the Defense Department and $116 million to help the Internal
Revenue Service pay the cost of sending out rebate checks authorized by the
recently enacted tax cut law.
The measure passed, 341 to 87.
In an earlier vote, Bush barely escaped an embarrassing slap when
Democrats moved to cut the proposed IRS increase by $29 million--the cost of
a letter the agency is sending to tell taxpayer of their impending tax rebate.
Democrats complained that the letter, which prominently mentions Bush,
reads like a piece of campaign literature. Republicans said it was needed to
save people from calling the IRS about their checks. The amendment failed,
216 to 212.
The bill now goes to the Senate, where Democrats are considering an even
bigger increase in energy aid for the poor.
Overall, the House bill would provide the $6.5 billion requested by
Bush. But it would change some spending priorities. For instance, Bush's
Office of Management and Budget objects strongly to provisions that would
rescind $389 million in money appropriated for the Federal Emergency
Management Agency--just as the disaster relief agency is facing big outlays
to cope with damage caused by Tropical Storm Allison.
That provision to rescind the money came under attack from Democrats and
Republicans, posing the debate's most serious challenge to the bill. But an
effort to send the bill back to the Appropriations Committee and restore the
money was defeated on a party line vote of 218 to 209.
The energy aid for the poor is provided through the Low-Income Home
Energy Assistance Program, which helps the poor and elderly pay heating and
air-conditioning bills. In California, a family of four must earn less than
$33,125 to be eligible, and the average benefit is $326 a year.
Although Republicans and Democrats have been divided over broad
questions of energy policy, there has been a bipartisan consensus on more
help for needy consumers. So, despite pressure to hold down the cost of the
supplemental spending bill, House Republicans doubled Bush's request for $150
billion in additional energy aid. GOP leaders blocked, on procedural
technicalities, Democratic amendments to increase the funding even more.
Republican leaders also fought efforts by Democrats to turn debate on
the spending bill into Congress' first broad-gauged discussion on the
nation's energy crisis. Democrats wanted to offer major energy amendments,
including one to impose strict cost-based price caps on wholesale electricity
in California--stricter price restraints than the policy announced Monday by
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.
Proponents of the stricter caps, echoing complaints by California Gov.
Gray Davis and others, said FERC's order did not go far enough to guarantee
relief for consumers against blackouts, shortages and price gouging.
Republicans argued that price caps would be counterproductive and that
California's problems will be solved only by increasing the energy supply.
Democrats lost a 222-205 procedural vote that blocked their amendments
from coming to a vote.It was an important victory for Republican leaders who
had feared mounting support for price caps even within their own party.
However, momentum flagged this week after the FERC decision.
The House bill also includes:
* $45 million for a Defense Department plan to make military bases in
California self-sufficient and get them off the state's power grid during
shortages.
* $1.5 million for planning and environmental studies for a proposed
upgrade in an electrical transmission line in Central California known as
Path 15.




Summer Starts, Power Doesn't Stop
Energy: Consumers show they can take the heat, with their conservation
helping to limit demand. But experts remain wary.

By MITCHELL LANDSBERG, Times Staff Writer

As unwelcome as the killer bees, as hyped as "Pearl Harbor," the big,
bad summer of 2001 officially arrived today and--did someone forget to turn
out the lights?
After months of dread, the Blackout Summer began on a curiously bright
note. Despite several days of summer-like weather, there was barely a whisper
about blackouts. The state that couldn't plug in a night light in January
without tripping electrical shortage alarms managed to enter the summer with
electricity to spare.
For the moment, power supplies look healthy. Wholesale electricity
prices are a sliver of what they were just a month ago. Demand for power is
down, apparently the result of a successful conservation campaign. And
California officials appear to have won their months-long battle with the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which imposed price and supply controls
on the Western electricity market beginning at midnight last night.
All in all, an auspicious beginning for what many have warned would be a
dreadful summer. So why aren't California energy officials blowing up
balloons for the big end-of-crisis party?
"We are not out of the woods," said Richard Sklar, the state's energy
supply czar. "We are not out of the woods on price, and we are not out of the
woods on availability."
His view is echoed by most of those who closely watch the state's
electrical market. So far, California's supply-demand balance is coming
closer to best-case predictions than to the worst. But it is a delicate
balance.
On Wednesday, with temperatures hovering around summer norms, operators
of the statewide power grid managed to maintain--if just barely--the 7% of
operating reserves they strive for. When reserves dip below that, the state
begins ascending the ladder of staged emergency declarations that eventually
lead to blackouts.
Total electricity use in the state peaked about 4 p.m. at 39,156
megawatts--a high for the year, but well below the state's all-time record of
45,884 megawatts, which was set on July 12, 1999.
State officials credit conservation with shaving off about 4,000
megawatts, an amount that easily means the difference between blackouts or no
blackouts on most days.
"There is no doubt in my mind that conservation . . . has led directly
to the situation that we're in now," said Mike Sloss, who tracks conservation
for the California Energy Commission.
Richard Roher, who crunches conservation numbers for the commission,
said consumers appear to be continuing to cut their electricity use by about
11%.
There also has been good news on the supply side of the equation. After
months in which power plant breakdowns and shutdowns were costing the state
as much as 15,000 megawatts of electricity at a time, most plants are now
online and outages were down to 4,300 megawatts Wednesday.
Most small, alternative energy suppliers finally reached agreement this
week in their epic contract battle with Southern California Edison, putting
that vital segment of the state's energy production back in business. And in
the next two weeks, the state's first two new major power plants in a decade
are scheduled to open, adding more than 1,000 megawatts to the power
stream--enough to serve about 750,000 typical homes.
State officials are also hoping that the FERC ruling, which limits
prices in the 11-state Western region and requires generators to sell
available power to California, will ease the situation further.
"Everyone is very interested to see how tomorrow unfolds, price-wise and
supply-wise," Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for California's grid
operator, said Wednesday.
For all the positive signs, no one is predicting that the state will
weather the summer without blackouts. No one knows how many power plants will
break down. Nor does anyone know the extent to which Californians' best
intentions to conserve will melt away in a sustained heat wave.
While the past few days have been hot, they haven't been searing. It was
81 in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday, 94 in Riverside, 102 in Sacramento,
109 in Palm Springs--toasty, but far from the hottest weather any of those
places can expect this summer.
Nor was it unusually hot in surrounding states, whose ability to sell
power to California depends in part on their own energy needs. Electricity
use generally rises with the thermometer, because air conditioners use more
power than most other appliances.
"If it gets hot in California, and it's also hot in the Northwest . . .
and it's hot in Phoenix, we could run into some significant problems," said
Jan Smutney-Jones, executive director of the Independent Energy Producers
Assn., a trade group for power plant owners in California.
The state has benefited recently from imports of electricity from the
Northwest, where snow runoff is cascading through electrical turbines. But
those imports are expected to dry up later in the summer as stream flowswhich
have been kept high to assist salmon runs--are scaled back to levels that
reflect the region's winter drought.
So the summer of 2001 could still be interesting. And it may begin with
a blackout after all. For weeks now, an e-mail campaign has spread through
the Internet, calling on people to voluntarily cut off most or all of their
power between 7 p.m. and 10 p.m. tonight.
The protest, called the "Roll Your Own Blackout," is the idea of a
Southern California artist who worked in tandem with a software engineer from
Berkeley. Their intention is to protest the energy policies recently
announced by President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney.
"When you hear Mr. Cheney, who drafted the energy plan, deriding
conservation as merely a personal virtue, it is as though he believes virtue
has no place in government policy, and that would be a very dangerous thing,"
said Dave Aragon, the software engineer.
The California crisis gave birth to their campaign, but Aragon said he
is hoping that the protest goes beyond the state's borders.
"Worldwide would be fine," he said.






Board Votes to Let State Tax Power Plants
Proposal: Levies on property currently are made by counties. The revenue
would increase, say proponents of change.

By NANCY VOGEL, Times Staff Writer

SACRAMENTO--State tax collectors endorsed a proposal Wednesday that
could force power plant owners to pay tens of millions of dollars more in
taxes next year.
The five-member Board of Equalization voted unanimously to assert
jurisdiction over the property taxes paid by companies with power plants that
produce more than 50 megawatts. Under the board's proposal--which faces
public hearings before it takes effect--the state would seize from counties
the authority to tax these plants.
State control could potentially enrich government coffers, because the
state would tax the plants based on their fair market value, while counties
tax power plant owners based on the original value of the plants plus a 2%
annual inflation rate.
Consumer advocates argue that the value of private power plants has
skyrocketed in the past year, as the price of wholesale electricity soared in
the malfunctioning market created under California's 1998 deregulation plan.
Under deregulation, utilities sold 22 power plants to private companies,
many of them based out of state, for a total of $3.2 billion.
"They are making exorbitant profits," said Lenny Goldberg, executive
director of the California Tax Reform Assn., a nonprofit group largely funded
by unions. He called the power plants "vastly underassessed."
Board of Equalization Chairwoman and state Controller Kathleen Connell
said the move is necessary not only because it might bring in more tax
revenue, but because California itself could soon build power plants or own
power lines under plans pushed by Gov. Gray Davis.
"We may not be getting the best value through the current system," said
Connell, "especially if the state proceeds with plans to own plants in
California.
"It makes sense to act now to bring all generating facilities under the
same assessment system," she said.
For many decades, the Board of Equalization levied property taxes on
power plants because they were owned by utilities and regulated by the state.
But in 1999, after the launch of deregulation, the tax board voted to allow
counties to assess property taxes on power plants under a formula set by
Proposition 13, the 1978 ballot measure that limits property taxes for
homeowners and businesses.
The board's vote Wednesday launches a process of public hearings that
could lead to a reversal of that 1999 decision.
Officials from several cities that are home to power plants urged the
Board of Equalization to take no action. Under the current system, cities
with power plants get a greater share of property tax revenue, which is
generally split among local governments and schools.
Long Beach got about $55,000 a year in property tax revenue when the
state was assessing taxes, said city Controller Barbara Hennessy, but now
gets nearly $1 million a year.
Shari L. Freidenrich, treasurer for Huntington Beach, said a reversal of
the board's tax method could cost the city--home to a major power plant--$1.5
million a year in property taxes.
A bill pending in the Legislature by Assemblywoman Carole Migden (D-San
Francisco) would protect those cities by guaranteeing that they get the same
proportion of property tax revenue even if the state reasserts control over
power plant assessments.
Goldberg, of the California Tax Reform Assn., argued that allowing the
state to tax plant owners based on market value would bring in more revenue
for the entire state.
As an example, he estimated that a big power plant on Monterey Bay owned
by Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Energy North America would have paid Monterey
County at least an additional $10 million in property taxes last year under
the proposed method of assessment. The plant, valued by the county at $362
million, is probably worth about $2 billion given market conditions, Goldberg
said.
The power industry argues that when California lifted state regulation
of power plants in 1998, those plants became businesses no different from a
department store or bakery in terms of property tax status.
"We would expect to be treated like any other business in California has
been treated since Prop. 13 went into place," said Duke spokesman Tom
Williams.



Davis' spinmeisters draw heat from watchdogs
State controller refuses to pay energy advisers

Gov. Gray Davis' decision to hire the "Masters of Disaster" -- two former
Clinton-Gore spin doctors -- has led to a lawsuit by an anti-tax group and a
refusal by the state controller to pay the two political strategists.
Since the energy crisis began, Davis has hired several nationally known
experts to advise him. But the recent contract for Chris Lehane and Mark
Fabiani has opened a political wound, in part because the two men are
considered fiercely partisan and politically ruthless.
State Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat who continually fights with
Davis, said yesterday that she will refuse to pay Lehane and Fabiani with
state funds. Their contract is worth $180,000 for six months.
Connell said it's hard for her to imagine that Lehane and Fabiani are working
on state policy, as required by law, and not politics.
"From my viewpoint, you're asking Californians to survive with fewer lights
on and you're asking them to assume the burden of $43 billion in long-term
debt for power," Connell said. "It's just another slap in the face to ask
them to pay for people to explain the situation away."
The National Tax-Limitation Committee, a Sacramento group that mostly
monitors legislation, filed a lawsuit last week alleging that Fabiani and
Lehane are violating the Political Reform Act because they also have done
work for Southern California Edison as consultants.
It's considered a conflict of interest for public officials to work on issues
that affect companies that pay them more than

I just spoke with Mr. Charles de Saillan, Asst. General Counsel for the NMED,
concerning the referenced Compliance Order.  Apparently the NMED mailed out
60 of these orders last week.  The NM legislature has adopted a statute of
limitations under the NM Air Quality Act and the NMED was acting to attempt
to foreclose the use of this defense.  (Dave - can Mary hunt this new
legislation down??).

The language in the order assessing a $15,000 penalty per day of violation is
standard language when the NMED has not assessed a specific figure.  It will
be a couple of weeks before the NMED will be able to provide us a specific
penalty.  We discussed settlement and the administrative hearing process.  A
settlement meeting is not likely to take place soon due to the NMED's
workload.  We need to have a number from the NMED before the settlement
conference anyway. We will have to file the request to go to hearing no later
tahn July 18th.  However, Charlie stated that if the respondent evidenced
good faith to achieve as settlement the Secretary had the discretion to allow
additional time to submit a full answer (where we provided all of the details
of our defense.)

I told Charlie we would be organizing ourselves internally and that we would
get back to him with some proposed dates for a settlement conference, a
request for hearing and a request to extend the time in which to file an
answer - preferably tied to after the settlement conference.

Let's see about dates and Dave or I will call the NMED and submit a letter
with the three items above.  We want to make sure that the NMED has time
before the end of the 30 day period to respond to our request for an
extension on the answer.

Calif Sen Pwr Probe Committee OKs Deposing Energy Execs
Updated: Friday, July 20, 2001 08:16 AMET


(This article was originally published Thursday)

By Jason Leopold

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES

LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--A California Senate committee investigating
manipulation in the state's wholesale power market approved a measure late
Thursday, authorizing the committee to depose the chief executives of major
energy companies to provide insight into the companies' trading practices.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation voted 28-6 in
favor of deposing some of the energy sector's most powerful chief executives.


The move comes a day after the committee held Reliant Energy Inc. (REI, news,
msgs) and Enron Corp. (ENE, news, msgs) in contempt for refusing to provide
documents on its electricity trading and sales practices. The full Senate is
expected to vote on the contempt charge and decide the punishment to impose.

Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, the committee chair, would have carte blanche to
depose executives, such as Enron Chairman Ken Lay, who has been singled out
by Attorney General Bill Lockyer for gouging consumers in the state.

Representatives of the energy companies under investigation were not
available for comment.

The committee has been investigating whether energy companies knowingly
manipulated the state's wholesale electricity market to drive up prices and
create artificial shortages.

It has yet to uncover a "smoking gun." But has secured the testimony of
former Duke Energy (DUK, news, msgs) power plant employees who told the
committee that the company reduced output at a San Diego power plant during
power emergencies to drive up power prices.

The state's Independent System Operator, however, conceded that it ordered
the fluctuations in capacity at the power plant.

HEADLINE: Energy secretary, former Gov. Wilson speak on energy crisis

BYLINE: By Rick Jurgens

BODY:

SAN FRANCISCO _ Two prominent Republicans came here on Thursday to promote
free-market solutions to the energy crisis that has hit California and
threatens
to spread nationwide.

Spencer Abraham, energy secretary in the Bush administration, only briefly
mentioned the state's current troubles and instead regaled 600 attendees at a
Bay Area Council banquet with the promises of new technologies.

Earlier, former Gov. Pete Wilson focused on the past as he offered 90 people
at the Public Policy Institute of California a rambling defense of the 1996
electricity industry restructuring law he signed.

At the heart of electricity industry restructuring is a traditional
Republican theme: a preference for market forces and competition over
regulators
and government planning. But the fate of California's electricity industry
restructuring plan now rests in the hands of Gray Davis, the state's
Democratic
governor.

Abraham never mentioned Davis.

"I didn't come here to play the blame game," he said in a news conference.

California's electricity problems are merely the most intense in a nation
facing "rising demand, stagnant supplies and an energy (infrastructure) that
is
out of date and in need of repair," he said.

Picking up on an initiative that has emerged as a priority for some
advocates
of restructuring, Abraham stressed the need for enhanced federal authority to
meld regional networks of high-voltage transmission lines into a national
grid.

But Abraham's main pitch was that California technology companies could
contribute "intellectual capital and ingenuity to the world of megawatts."

Looking far into the new century, he offered a vision of an energy industry
replete with micro turbines, fuel cells and hybrid engines.

"Our carbon-based economy itself may pass from the scene to be replaced,
perhaps, by a hydrogen- based economy," he said.

Wilson's concerns were more prosaic. He defended restructuring _ now plagued
by soaring prices and rolling blackouts _ as a step forward from the previous
structure, where electricity came from regulated monopolies.

"There were flaws," Wilson said of the restructuring bill that he signed
into
law in 1996. "I acknowledge that. They were less important than launching
California on the path to deregulation."

Restructuring was the only way to bring down power costs that were higher
than in other states, and to break a regulatory logjam that had limited power
plant development, he said.

Wilson criticized the law's retail rate freeze. Although it triggered a
financial crisis for the state's utilities, the freeze was largely "a
self-inflicted wound," insisted upon by utilities seeking to be repaid for
costly investments in nuclear plants and contracts with small generators, he
said.

Wilson also said it had been a mistake to forbid the utilities to sign
long-term contracts with generators. Those were ruled out because regulators
feared such contracts would give utilities an unfair advantage as competition
developed, he said.

Noting that he had been singled out for criticism by Davis, Wilson fired
back, saying that Davis had been too slow to invoke the "virtually
dictatorial"
powers that the governor has in emergencies, including electricity shortages.

But Wilson expressed some sympathy for Davis, noting that the Legislature
would not have allowed faster power plant siting and construction without a
crisis.

He also grudgingly complimented his successor's political skills.

"I admire Gov. Davis' ability to conduct public relations," Wilson said,
noting that a visit by President George W. Bush had turned into an "absolute
public relations triumph for the governor."

Wilson echoed some of Davis' themes. Under presidents Clinton and Bush, the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's response to the crisis had been "a bit
slow off the mark," Wilson said.

There remain "unanswered questions" about the role of natural gas suppliers,
and whether shortages and high prices in California resulted from "artificial
or
real constraints on pipeline capacity," he added.

Generators, while not the cause of the crisis, should also be held to
account.

"If people have been guilty of gouging, they should pay up," he said.

Wilson said the current troubles are a symptom of the state's failure to
plan
for growth. The electricity crisis "will be dwarfed in the future by a water
crisis," he warned.

HEADLINE: Edison Bailout Bills Remain Stalled

BYLINE: MIGUEL BUSTILLO, CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO

BODY:

Leading lawmakers conceded they would probably leave on their summer break
without passing legislation aimed at rescuing Southern California Edison from
its financial straits as competing bailouts stalled in the Legislature
Thursday.

The Assembly is expected to consider one of two rival measures to save
Edison
today, and the Senate is expected to take up an Edison rescue deal of its own.

But all three pending measures face long odds and none have sufficient
support to clear both houses, legislative leaders said.

With the Legislature set to quit for the summer as early as today, the
leaders predicted they would be forced to continue negotiations during the
monthlong recess in hopes of brokering a deal.

"I can't imagine that in the next 24 hours" lawmakers will reach consensus
on
an Edison rescue, said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), who
coauthored
one of the lower house's rescue bills with Assembly Speaker Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks).

One indication of the lack of enthusiasm for the legislation is that Keeley
himself does not support the measure that bears his name. "I don't believe
that
this bill in its current form should become law," he said. "This bill is not
ready."

The maneuvering in both houses Thursday capped a day of frenetic activity in
the state Capitol, which has become flooded with cell phone-carrying lobbyists
seeking to influence the Edison deal for seemingly every special interest in
the
state.

Yet amid the flurry of action, there seemed little chance of actually making
law. Many of the participants said the legislative debate appeared to be less
an
attempt to pass a bill than a war of one-upsmanship between the houses to see
who could "lob a grenade" into the rival house and go home until August. That
way, if Edison soon winds up in Bankruptcy Court, leaders of each house could
argue they were not to blame.

Hoping to head off a growing sentiment among lawmakers that bankruptcy may
not be such a bad alternative, Gov. Gray Davis spent the day working the
phones
in hopes of persuading legislators that a government rescue of Edison would be
good for the state.

To avoid mass blackouts, California has been purchasing billions of dollars
worth of electricity since the beginning of this year because the state's two
largest private utilities, Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric, are no longer
credit-worthy enough to buy power on behalf of their customers.

The utilities lost that status and ran up billions in debt the last two
years
because they were paying high prices for power on the wholesale market and
could
not recover those costs from customers because of a state-imposed rate freeze.

As a result, the state government is stuck in the power-buying business
until
the utilities regain their financial footing--an expensive predicament that
threatens the state's financial health.

Davis attempted to head off the crisis by negotiating rescues of the two
utilities, but PG&E lost faith in the talks and opted to take itself into
Bankruptcy Court in April, embarrassing the Democratic governor.

Days later, Davis reached a tentative rescue deal with Southern California
Edison. But the plan hit the Legislature with a thud amid concerns it was
overly
generous to Edison, and it has languished for months.

Last week, lawmakers finally picked up the pace and began moving forward
with
a series of competing proposals to alter the governor's deal with Edison. But
it
was clear from the outset that no consensus had emerged, and many lawmakers
are
becoming convinced that legislative inaction--even if it means bankruptcy--may
be the best way to resolve Edison's financial predicament.

"We're bailing out people who don't need to be bailed out," said Sen. Ross
Johnson (R-Irvine).

Legislative leaders hoped to pass something before today when the Assembly
and Senate are scheduled to break for their traditional summer recess. The
date
is considered important because Edison and Davis had set an Aug. 15 deadline
for
lawmakers to take action on the rescue deal. If no bill is passed by then--as
seems likely--the utility has the right to walk away from negotiations.

However, it became evident Thursday that the dueling measures making their
way through both houses lacked strong support.

In the Assembly, the Hertzberg-Keeley bill, a modification of Davis'
original
plan, was competing against a rival bill by Assemblyman Rod Wright (D-Los
Angeles), who had teamed with Republicans to push what he bluntly called a
"straight bailout" of Edison.

In the Senate, Davis' original plan was amended by Sen. Byron Sher
(D-Stanford) and turned into a trimmed-down rescue plan that was opposed by
Edison.

Sher's bill was voted down twice in policy committees Wednesday and
Thursday,
but it was resuscitated both times, and is now on the Senate floor.

HEADLINE: Edison May Avert Bankruptcy Filing;
Energy: Thanks to a rate increase and natural gas price drop, the utility's
improved cash flow may cover its electricity costs.

BYLINE: JERRY HIRSCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER

BODY:

For the first time in months, Southern California Edison is collecting more
money than it is spending on electricity, a shift that could enable the
utility
to avoid bankruptcy without a state intervention as dramatic as the proposed $
2.8-billion purchase of the company's transmission lines.

The turnabout has come during the last several weeks as natural gas
prices--a
major component in the cost of electricity--have plummeted and as Edison has
collected more money from customers through a record increase in rates
approved
by state regulators.

The utility this month expects to collect more than it will spend on
electricity--the first time that has happened since the state's power crunch
started in May 2000. If the trend holds, Edison would be able to cover several
hundred million dollars in losses that piled up after Feb. 1 from its
purchases
of electricity, said executives at the Rosemead-based company.

Edison's relief comes against a backdrop in which the California power
crisis
appears to be easing, as consumers conserve energy, new power plants come
online
and wholesale prices moderate from the high levels of last winter.

The executives said that barring an unusually severe heat wave, which would
prompt customers to crank up energy-guzzling air conditioners, or another
spike
in natural gas prices, Edison by early next year also could make payments on a
proposed bond offering to pay down its $3.5 billion in debt from energy
purchases before Feb. 1.

Creditors of the utility and consultants working with the governor's office
agree that such a scenario could mean that Edison would be able to stay out of
U.S. Bankruptcy Court without the state buying the company's transmission
lines,
which is a key element in Gov. Gray Davis' now-stalled proposal to rescue the
utility.

Jim Scilacci, the utility's chief financial officer, has hinted at improving
company finances during conference calls with creditors holding $931 million
in
defaulted bonds and notes in recent weeks. Investors have responded
positively,
boosting the company's depressed stock price about 45% in the last six weeks
to
a Thursday close of $14.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Although Edison's cash flow may be enough to cover its electricity costs,
its
huge debts keep it far from solvency. Moreover, the company still faces two
wild
cards in its fight to avoid bankruptcy: California's own claims on that cash
and
the utility's uncertain prospects of gaining state approval to use the money
to
repay its debts.

The Department of Water Resources is buying electricity for 27 million
Californians served by Edison and the state's two other regulated utilities.
The
agency could disclose as soon as today how big a slice it will take from
Edison's rate collections to repay a proposed $13.4-billion bond offering to
cover the state's purchases.

The water agency began buying electricity from private generators in
January,
after Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the Northern California utility,
became mired in debt. PG&E went on to file for bankruptcy protection in April.

"What this means for Edison all depends on how much money it can keep," said
Paul Patterson, an analyst with investment bank ABN Amro in New York.

The water department's requirements could eat up much of the margin that has
provided Edison with its small cushion this month. However, Joseph Fichera,
chief executive of Saber Partners, which is advising the governor, said the
latest numbers indicate that there is enough money in current rates to
implement
the governor's plan to pay for the utility's debt as well as the state's
current
and future power purchases.

Even if the water department allocation still left room for Edison to pay
off
its debts, such a course of action would require approval by the state
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission. Although energy trends appear
to allow the utility to regain its financial footing, analysts cautioned that
the utility still could find itself in Bankruptcy Court if the state doesn't
provide a method for Edison to pay its debts.

"While we might be able to cover our costs going forward, it is equally
important that we have a way to pay off that $3.5-billion debt," said Brian
Bennett, an Edison vice president. "But without knowing what [the water
department's] revenue needs are, we won't know what is left over in rates to
cover our costs."

Bennett blamed the utility's so-called under-collection--debts that piled up
as frozen consumer rates could not cover soaring wholesale electricity
costs--on
what he called "flawed regulatory policies."

Based on recent energy prices, Bennett said, "We are just only beginning to
repay the under-collection."

The recently enacted rate increases, which kicked in last month, have pushed
what Edison can charge customers for the electricity component of their bills
from about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour to 10.27 cents.

At the same time, declining natural gas prices have sliced in half what the
utility must pay to a group of small and alternative-energy companies that
generate about 27% of its electricity needs. Edison, for example, paid this
group 18.6 cents a kilowatt-hour in February. That dropped to 13.6 cents by
May
and now stands at about 7.5 cents. Each penny decline in the cost of
electricity
from this group of generators represents more than $200 million in savings for
Edison on an annual basis.

Bennett cautioned that if the water department requires additional funds or
if Edison's energy costs were to turn upward again, "then rates once again may
not be adequate to cover our generation costs. It is therefore imperative that
this uncertainty in the rate structure be cured now so we establish
predictable,
stable rates for our customers."

Three plans to aid Edison to varying degrees are working their way through
the Legislature, though late Thursday it appeared none would be approved
before
lawmakers adjourn for a summer recess. Several legislators have said they are
content to let Edison join PG&E in bankruptcy.

Any plan that would allow Edison to use a portion of the rates it is
collecting to pay off a bond offering would meet the objection of some
consumer
groups, which label the concept a corporate bailout.

"Just as the utilities gambled on deregulation and were winners at first,
Edison now has to be responsible for its losses," said Harvey Rosenfield,
president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica.
He
said Bankruptcy Court is the most appropriate place for Edison to resolve its
financial problems.

Several creditors of the utility, however, said that as long as Edison can
tread water or even work down its debts, there is little incentive to put the
company into bankruptcy, which would only add another legal layer and more
expenses to an exceptionally complicated situation.

Creditors could move against the company if they believed its finances were
declining and thus shrinking the amount of cash and assets that could be
distributed in a bankruptcy proceeding. They also could put Edison into
involuntary bankruptcy if some creditors exacted payment from the company
ahead
of others that are owed money.

HEADLINE: State advisers forced to sell energy stocks;

CONFLICT: Holdings called unethical

SOURCE: Chronicle Staff Writer

BYLINE: Mark Martin

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
One consultant hired by the state to negotiate long-term electricity contracts
owned stock in a company that signed billion-dollar deals with California.

Another fresh hire bought more than $10,000 in stock in Enron Corp. -- the
Houston power trader frequently vilified by Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers --
as
he helped the state develop electricity buying strategy.

A top Davis lawyer told the two consultants and seven others on Wednesday
morning to sell off stock in companies like Enron and Calpine Corp. within
four
hours or lose their jobs.

Having a financial interest in electric companies while working for the
state on power issues was not ethical, said Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs
secretary, in a memo.

All nine complied with the directive, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio
said, but controversy intensified yesterday over whether some of the state's
hired guns managing the energy crisis have conflicts of interest.

The stock investments have come to light in the past week as 35 consultants
hired by the state to buy and schedule power and to negotiate energy contracts
have submitted documents detailing their personal finances.

Most of the consultants who owned stock list their jobs as schedulers --
those who schedule electricity deliveries after power has been purchased.

But others more directly involved with power trading also owned stock in
energy companies, documents show.

Richard Ferreira earns $200 an hour to help negotiate and manage the
state's
long-term contracts with power companies. He started his job Jan. 31.

According to Ferreira's financial statement, he owned between $2,000 and $
10,000 worth of stock in Calpine Corp. -- the company based in San Jose that
announced on Feb. 28 it had signed two long-term contracts with the state
worth
$8.3 billion.

Ferreira could not be reached for comment, and spokesmen for the Department
of Water Resources, which hired the consultants, said he did not know if
Ferreira worked on the Calpine contracts.

Another consultant, Richard Nichols, bought between $10,000 and $100,000
worth of stock in Enron in April -- more than three months after his company
signed on with the state to help "in the procurement of power supplies,"
according to his job description. The stock buy came at a time when the
Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission was taking a hard line against wholesale
electricity price caps for California.

Nichols' company, Navigant Consulting, Inc., could make as much as $800,000
for its work for the state this year. Nichols could not be reached for
comment.

Citing invoices from Controller Kathleen Connell's office, Secretary of
State Bill Jones, an announced GOP candidate for governor, argued that there
are
at least seven other Navigant employees who are billing the state for work on
energy issues. None of them have disclosed their financial interests.

Jones said he takes issue with the Davis administration's decisions on who
should file financial statements and who should be exempt.

FINANCES NOT DISCLOSED

Several consultants, including two Wall Street firms that made $275,000 a
month to negotiate the state's attempts to bail out troubled public utilities,
have not disclosed their finances because Davis officials have concluded they
do
not fit the definition of a consultant.

Jones has suggested that the state's long-term deals with several companies
to deliver electricity might be invalid if negotiators had a financial stake
in
those companies.

Maviglio said Davis officials were investigating whether there had been any
direct conflicts. The state attorney general's office and the state's Fair
Political Practices Commission also are reviewing Jones' allegations.

Maviglio and a spokesman for the state's Department of Water and Power
could
not say yesterday whether new employees were asked before they were hired
whether they had any financial stake in the energy market.

STOCKS SOLD VOLUNTARILY

But some consultants acknowledged a potential conflict and got rid of
stocks
before this week. In his filing, Mark Skowdronski reports owning more than $
10,000 worth of Reliant Energy stocks when he began his job in March of
negotiating long-term contracts for the state. When he was given the task of
negotiating with Reliant, he said he sold his stock on March 20.

Jones has stopped short of accusing anyone of criminal activity. And a
letter from Attorney General Bill Lockyer to Jones notes that the consultants
would have to own more than 3 percent of a company they dealt with to be
prosecuted criminally.

Maviglio said the accusations come from a man who is launching his run for
Davis' job next year.

"This is all politics," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "We're
following the law."

He said that when the state was forced to enter the business of buying
power
earlier this year, officials had to quickly hire people who knew the energy
business, including some who still had investments in power companies.

"If you want a plumber, you hire a guy who has plumbing experience,"
Maviglio said.E-mail Mark Martin at markmartin@sfchronicle.com.

HEADLINE: Democrats defy Davis with bill on PUC;

Utilities panel would keep power over rates

SOURCE: Chronicle Sacramento Bureau

BYLINE: Lynda Gledhill

DATELINE: Sacramento

BODY:
Lawmakers moved with lightning speed yesterday to undo a plan that would force
California regulators to raise electricity rates whenever state power buyers
deem it necessary.

A hastily introduced bill pits Democratic lawmakers against the
administration of Gov. Gray Davis, which is counting on the state Public
Utilities Commission to approve rate increases to pay for electricity without
questioning whether the state got a good price.

Historically, utilities bought their electricity and asked the PUC to
approve rate hikes. The PUC decided whether the requests were justified.

But with the utilities now deeply in debt and the state buying electricity,
the old system has broken down. This week, the PUC issued a draft agreement
that
would guarantee the state would get as much money as it needs to pay for the
electricity it is buying.

Consumer advocates said the proposed agreement would force the PUC to cede
its responsibility to protect customers from unreasonable rate increases.

Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, called the agreement
"overreaching" by the governor's Department of Water Resources, which is
buying
the state's power.

Under Burton's bill, consumers would still have to repay $13.4 billion in
bonds that the state plans to float to cover its purchases. But the bill would
allow the PUC to scrutinize the state's expenses beyond those covered by the
bond -- costs mounting to billions of dollars over the next 15 to 20 years.

The bill passed out of two committees with bipartisan support yesterday and
now faces a vote by the full Senate. Both business and consumer groups
expressed
their support for the measure.

"This is better for ratepayers," said Lenny Goldberg of the Utility Reform
Network. "It makes the bond issue secure and gives a chance to look into all
of
the contracts."

PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said some change is needed to restore
commission oversight.

"The only check and balance on the Department of Water Resources as it is
would be the governor," Bilas said. "I think it takes a different branch of
government to do that oversight."

But Bruce Van Dusen, a lawyer hired by the Department of Water Resources,
said Burton's bill could delay the bond sale and jeopardize the general fund.

The concern is that while Burton's bill guarantees that the bond issue
would
be repaid, it does not spell out how all the long-term electricity contracts
that the state has signed will be covered. The contracts stipulate that the
generators will be paid through electricity rates.Chronicle staff writer

HEADLINE: More energy fallout

BODY:
THEY SAY nothing is fair in love and war. It isn't. But nor is it fair when it
comes to energy.

In Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney, champion of the drill-and-burn
industry, asks the Navy to foot the electric bills for his mansion.

At the same time, the vice president refuses to disclose the costs incurred
by his energy task force or to reveal the hot shots from the oil and gas
industry who helped shape its final policies.

Closer to home, California residents brace for the aftershocks of the
energy
crisis. With the state now locked into secret, long-term and costly energy
contracts, it is the public -- not the energy suppliers who made out like
bandits -- who will be burdened by the billions spent purchasing electricity.

At present, only 39 percent of those surveyed approve of the way Gov. Gray
Davis has handled this crisis. Approval may drop even lower when California
residents absorb the astonishing news that we suddenly enjoy an energy surplus
and that our state is now selling it on a glutted market.

Add to the disgruntled those folks who were already in the habit of
shutting
off lights and lowering their thermostats. For them, the mail brought no 20
percent rebate on their electricity bill. It is the watt hogs, who never
lowered
the air conditioner and left lights burning all over their homes, whose paltry
efforts netted them the governor's award.

Give the governor credit for keeping the lights on in California. But his
less-than-bold decisions will result in serious political and economic
consequences. Soon, we will have to confront the grave reality that we have
mortgaged many of our dreams for expanded health care, improved education and
support for the mentally ill for a future burdened by crushing debt.

HEADLINE: PUC agrees to adjust electric rates if necessary

BYLINE: By KAREN GAUDETTE, Associated Press Writer

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO

BODY:

When the California Department of Water Resources asks the Public Utilities
Commission to raise electric rates, the PUC no longer will be able to refuse
if
it feel those hikes are unjustified or are not in the public's best interest.

So reads a proposal between the DWR and the state Public Utilities
Commission
released earlier this week that could go into effect next month and has both
PUC
members and public advocacy groups worried.

"This gives an unelected unaccountable state agency ... the unilateral right
to order rate increases for the next 15 years," Harvey Rosenfield, President
of
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer rights said earlier this week. "Every
mistake they could possibly make will also be passed along to ratepayers."

The numbers that will indicate whether the state will need to try out the
proposed process are scheduled to be released by the DWR on Friday. Loretta
Lynch, PUC president, and Oscar Hidalgo, a DWR spokesman, both said they
believe
current electric rates cover the state's power buying costs for now.

But the thought of a state agency potentially hitting residents and
businesses in the pocketbook without any oversight so troubles Sen. John
Burton,
D-San Francisco, that he is pushing legislation that would retain the PUC's
authority to say no.

Since January, the DWR has spent more than $8 billion buying electricity for
the customers of three financially ailing utilities. It will likely spend $43
billion to supply Californians with electricity over the next 20 years.

The PUC raised rates twice already this year, money which the utilities pass
along to the DWR to help it pay its debts. But in order for the state to issue
some $13 billion in bonds later this summer, it must show Wall Street that it
has a solid stream of money rolling in that will cover its power-buying needs.
Ratepayers will pay off those bonds over 15 years, and state officials say a
solid revenue stream could help keep interest low.

The PUC/DWR proposal gives the DWR - a state agency whose director is not
elected, critics point out - the ability to ask for rate increases that would
essentially be rubber-stamped by the PUC with a 30 to 90 day turnaround.

"This authority to pass through costs without CPUC review would never be
permitted for costs incurred by a utility," Burton wrote.

Burton's bill would set aside a certain amount of ratepayer revenue to go to
DWR, rather than steering the entire amount in its direction.

Power buying expenses and administrative costs would be reviewed by the PUC
and the public to determine if it is appropriate to raise electric rates to
fund
them.

The bill would also retain the right of Californians to have someone other
than their local utility provide their electricity, a tenant of deregulation
which the PUC has seemed likely to end.

In May, the PUC issued a record rate increase that raises electric rates by
roughly 38 percent for residential ratepayers who use the most power, and by
varying amounts for farmers and businesses. That followed a roughly 10 percent
rate hike in January.

The state has bought electricity for the customers of Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., Southern California Edison Co. and San Diego Gas and Electric
Co.
since January, when the utilities warned the state that high power prices and
the inability to recoup their costs through frozen electric rates were driving
them into debt.

PG&E filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Edison and SDG&E both
have agreed to sell their transmission lines at above market value to the
state
for to make up for their losses, though the Legislature has not decided
whether
to approve the deals.

The PUC will take comments on the agreement until Aug. 1.

HEADLINE: Power Struggle

ANCHORS: ALISON SMITH

BODY:

ALISON SMITH: Oil. Gas. Alberta. Three words often said in the same breath.
But it's coal that supplies the province with most of its electricity. A
plentiful resource with enormous potential. Especially for export to the
United
States. Canada's largest private power company TransAlta is planning a huge
expansion to one of its coal fired plants. But it's a plan that's meeting
plenty
of resistance. Here's the CBC's Margo McDiarmid with the power struggle.

TYKE DREVER: It used to be where the kids used to play in the sand and the
level of the lake was basically right here. At that point in time I could
bring
my motor boat into here and actually winch it into the boathouse for the
winter.
Now if we look in the distance behind me, you'll see how far out my motor boat
is now.

MARGO MCDIARMID: Tyke Drever has seen his lake change a lot over the years.
The water is simply disappearing.

DREVER: That used to all be lake bottom. That was all lake bottom. There was
water covering all that but not has turned into green grass.

MCDIARMID: Drever's home is on Lake Wabamun, about 75 kilometers west of
Edmonton, one of the region's most popular recreation spots. It's also the
site
of three coal fired power plants owned by TransAlta, two of them right on the
lake. The coal comes from the mine right across the bay. Drever and his
neighbours have an on-going battle with TransAlta, Canada's largest private
power company. They blame TransAlta for blocking streams that drain into the
lake, for sucking up water to make power.

DREVER: I think it would be fair to say that probably the mining is the
starting point of the problems because nobody knows what in actual fact, what
the mining has done to the natural mother nature's inflow, influx of water
into
the lake.

MCDIARMID: And now there'll be an even larger power plant just down the
road.
TransAlta wants to double the size of its Keephills plant, adding two new
generators like these. Alone they'd be enough to power a city the size of
Edmonton.

LINDA DUNCAN (Wabamun Lake Resident): I'd rather have the lake back.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN (1): I'd rather have the lake back too.

MCDIARMID: Drever and other members of a local group don't like the thought
of an even bigger power plant nearby.

DREVER: They will say that the Keephills plant is outside of the watershed
area of the Lake Wabamun. Question mark. We don't know that.

BOB CALHOON (Wabamun Lake Resident): It scares me.

MCDIARMID: Why is that?

CALHOON: Because we've seen the damage that is done now with the plants we
have here now. What kind of damage is going to be done when they expand these
plants even greater than they are now?

MCDIARMID: TransAlta hasn't built a new plant in years because of
uncertainty
over deregulation. Now the rules are clear. Power is bought and sold by
private
companies. With an energy shortage in Alberta, TransAlta is ready to expand.

MIKE KELLY (TransAlta): We have such a shortage of electricity and demand is
so high that we thought we really had to move, to do something about that, to
fill the gap.

MCDIARMID: TransAlta says most of its new power will stay in Alberta. Any
extra will be exported to B.C. and then possibly to California. But Americans
want more from any Alberta company willing to sell. With natural gas prices
going up, cheap Alberta coal power is a hot item.

MURRAY SMITH: When the Americans come to visit you, they don't come for tea.
And they want things.

MCDIARMID: Energy Minister Murray Smith says Alberta will help them out. At
a
recent gathering of energy ministers, Smith pointed out the province is ready
to
cash in on the export business.

SMITH: I think that exports are actually, in the long run, a good thing for
Alberta. To be able to reach out with exports allows us to build the grids,
build the inner connects and then allows us to generate more power that will
give Albertans lower prices.

MCDIARMID: And they're already lining up to buy Alberta's power. The
National
Energy Board is now juggling seven applications for export licenses to bring
power from Alberta to the U.S. and more than half are from big American
companies. One of the largest is Morgan Stanley, an international investment
bank based in New York. Morgan Stanley wants a 20 year export license from the
National Energy Board. The plan? Buy up extra power in Alberta and sell it to
California.

BRIAN STAZINSKI (Clean Air Coalition): I think they're profiteers. They're
coming in here and asking for about three percent of our supply to sell to the
United States and when we ask them where are you getting supplied from, they
go,
hm, we don't know. We don't care. We're just going to get a piece of the
action
and make some money on this. What's cost effective about continuing to
generate
all kinds of emissions?

MCDIARMID: Brian Stazinski is an environmentalist, named on of Time Magazine
six heroes of the planet for his work with conservation. But now he's taken on
new work. To stop Morgan Stanley's export application and others like it.
Because exports mean building more plants and burning more coal.

STAZINSKI: It's just fast track approval all the way to the bank. And so
we're going to see a lot of developments if the Morgan Stanley's get their
way.
I don't think the people of Alberta understand that.

PAT SPILSTEAD (Wabamun Lake Resident): So many of these things are now
sensible.

MCDIARMID: The residents of Wabamun Lake understand it. They just have to
look out the window. TransAlta is expanding one plant now. The power will
mostly
stay in Alberta. But no one around this table thinks it will stop there.

DREVER: At five or six applications a year, it's not unreasonable to assume
that there might be eight plants around the shore of this lake. I mean where
does it stop?

DUNCAN: We're swamped and we keep saying who's there in the Government of
Alberta and the Government of Canada to represent the interests of the public
of
Alberta?

SPILSTEAD: Where do the economics become more important than the
environment.
Now we're an isolated little problem, but maybe a perfect example of a great
intrusion on the Alberta environment.

MCDIARMID: And critics say the environment will pay the price. Alberta coal
is considered cleaner because it has low amounts of chemicals that cause smog.
But burning it still creates a long list of toxins like particulants -- tiny
bits of dust that can lodge in the lungs. They're considered a toxic
substance.
Coal power increases carbon dioxide linked to global warming. And then there's
mercury. It's linked to birth defects and nerve damage. New research by
federal
committee on mercury shows that among the provinces, Alberta's coal plants
generate 41 percent of all the mercury in the country, the highest rate in
Canada. Environmentalists are pushing for a public debate on exporting power.

STAZINSKI: They should have a say about whether or not we should be digging
up our farm land, burning the coal, getting all of the emissions so that the
Americans can get the benefits of the electricity. People of Alberta should
have
an opportunity to say whether or not that's a good idea.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN (2): Anything you didn't understand or anything you need to
clarify?

MCDIARMID: Power companies are well aware the public is nervous.

UNIDENTIFIED MAN (3): I was just wondering how much increase of mercury...

MCDIARMID: TransAlta is hosting meetings to answer questions. It's promising
the Keephills plant will use state of the art technology to keep its pollution
to a minimum.

KELLY: There are new standards that have been put in place by Alberta
environment and we're going to meet those standards and we're going to put on
some, some pretty solid technology actually to control our emissions.

DREVER: Come on, Kilt

Come on

That a girl



MCDIARMID: It will get busier in the Lake Wabamun area. TransAlta wants to
open its bigger plant in four years. The company says the Keephills plant and
the mine are too far away to affect the lake. In fact, it's now putting some
of
the water back to raise the level. Tyke Drever would like to think that's
true.

DREVER: Wouldn't it be wonderful if in my lifetime I could see this water
lapping at those piers again, lapping at those railway ties again? And my
kids'
kids playing in water at the edge here. Kiltie

Come on Kilt



MCDIARMID: Drever is also realistic. He knows there's a big thirst for
electricity. It's very political. New projects will be hard to stop. And he
wonders what price in the end Alberta will have to pay for its power.

DREVER: It's raining. It's raining a little bit.

MCDIARMID: For The National, I'm Margo McDiarmid in Wabamun Lake, Alberta.

SMITH: We'll be back in a moment with a program note.

HEADLINE: Cheaper Energy Undercuts California's Long-Term Power Contracts

BYLINE: By Dana Bartholomew

BODY:


California suddenly faces an energy surplus, forcing the state to sell power
it bought for an average of $ 138 per megawatt for as little as a dollar,
electricity traders say.

In fact, the state has sold its unused power so cheaply that the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power -- which has made tens of millions selling power
to the state during the crisis -- has become an occasional buyer of power from
the state at rates below its normal costs.

State officials acknowledged that cool temperatures and the surprising
success of conservation efforts have glutted the energy market in the past
week
but they dismissed the surplus as a "blip."

They said they are getting $ 15 to $ 30 per megawatt for up to 6,000
megawatts a day during the early-morning hours -- losing millions of dollars
on
power purchased in recent months under long-term contracts.

"Both $ 1 and $ 5 have occurred," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of
the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents many generators and
utilities
that sell millions in power to the state each day.

"It gives Californians a great glimpse of what happens when the state moves
into private industry. They (legislators) do the right thing politically, and
it
backfires economically," he said.

Critics say the state, in an effort to capture runaway wholesale energy
costs
this spring, locked in power at too high a price. Ultimately, ratepayers of
such
private utilities as Southern California Edison, will be forced to pick up the
tab.

"We think it's an outrage," said Kris Vosburgh of the Howard Jarvis
Taxpayers
Association. "The governor went willingly into these agreements and tried to
prevent the public and the press from seeing them (and) didn't ask for public
or
expert participation.

"Now it's the ratepayers that are paying for his mistake."

The state, assisted by former Los Angeles DWP General Manager David Freeman,
has negotiated more than $ 42 billion in such contracts that stretch as far as
2021.

State officials disputed the rock-bottom rates quoted by forum traders.

"I'm looking at the average price, and (it) far exceeds a dollar," said
Oscar
Hidalgo, spokesman for the state Department of Water Resources, which now
spends
$ 30 million a day on power, down from $ 65 million in May.

"This is an overall blip on our picture here."

Gov. Gray Davis defended the state's purchases, saying through spokesman
Steve Maviglio that they had stabilized the market.

"Like we said all along, we're doing everything within our power to control
the situation and stabilize things," he told The New York Times. "But the
weather is not within our control. When the utilities were in this business,
they ran into this situation routinely."

While the state once spent most of its money for energy on the volatile spot
market, it currently buys 95 percent of its power under long-term contracts.

Unlike natural gas, electrical energy can't be stored and must be passed on.
When usage fails to meet expected demand, during a cooler summer for example,
suppliers are forced to accept whatever price they can get for the surplus --
sometimes at a loss.

Some of that loss, Hidalgo said, was to pay back power loans from the
federal
Bonneville Power Authority in Washington state.

While the state admitted shedding up to 20 percent of its power since July
11, Ackerman said that up to 6,000 megawatts a night of surplus power was
previously "laid off."

Selling surplus power is common to any utility -- or acting utility -- in
the
energy business. California Energy Markets, a trade weekly, said the state
sold
such power July 12 at $ 25 a megawatt.

Critics have called the state contracts with 42 energy generators turkeys
for
locking in power purchases at $ 138 per megawatt hour, or $ 70 long-term.

"The state was in a terrible bargaining position at the time (it wrote the
contracts)," said Pasadena Councilman Sid Tyler, chairman of the Deregulation
Committee for the Pasadena Water and Power Department.

"There's nothing quite as bad as having to buy high and sell low -- we all
know the consequences of that, long-term."

Assemblyman Keith Richman, R-Granada Hills, has written an alternative bill
to rescue Southern California Edison that he said has a provision to scrap the
state's energy contracts.

Richman, who had sued the state to release details of the contracts, said an
estimate from the state Controller's Office pegs them closer to $ 50 billion.

"I am very concerned we have entered into these long-term contracts that
will
not only cause an excess of power, but will cost the ratepayers for years to
come and be a burden on the back of Californians."

HEADLINE: Six months later, utility debts are still toughest nut to crack

SOURCE: Scripps-McClatchy Western Service

BYLINE: DAN WALTERS

DATELINE: SACRAMENTO, Calif.

BODY:

When Gov. Gray Davis and other state politicians finally became engaged in
the energy crisis last January - a half-year late - the state's major
investor-owned utilities had already amassed more than $13 billion in debt
from
runaway power costs and were out of credit.

Davis and the Legislature launched a massive state power purchase program, a
speed-up of new power plants, conservation subsidies and other actions, not
all
of which have successful. But everyone involved knew that the utilities'
debts,
which had driven them to the brink of bankruptcy, would be the most complex
and
politically difficult aspect of the crisis.

Six months later, that's still true.

An administration team negotiated for weeks with Pacific Gas and Electric
and
Southern California Edison on schemes to retire their debts and bring them
back
to a creditworthy status. The talks with PG&E went nowhere and three months
ago,
the huge San Francisco-based utility filed for bankruptcy. Davis, clearly
concerned that Edison would follow, hammered out a deal with the smaller
utility
within hours.

It was, by any standard, a sweet deal for Edison and its parent company,
Edison International, too sweet for just about everyone in the Legislature,
and
immediately efforts began to change it.

Edison lobbyists worked the Legislature and the utility cranked up a massive
advertising and public relations campaign, to no apparent avail. And Davis,
oddly, pulled back from the fray. The governor concentrated on another aspect
of
the crisis with greater political sex appeal: demanding that generators, many
of
whom are PG&E and Edison creditors, be forced to repay many billions of
dollars
because, as he put it, they had gouged the state. Ultimately, Davis' campaign
failed, although his strident advocacy did, apparently, arrest his decline in
public opinion polls. Meanwhile, the Edison deal languished. With the
Legislature now poised to leave Sacramento on a month-long summer recess and a
self-imposed deadline for enacting the Edison plan approaching, the Capitol is
newly aflutter with efforts.

"Complex" doesn't even begin to describe the situation. There are at least
three alternative plans kicking around, none of which can be passed as
written.
Davis may be willing to accept almost anything that would save him from the
embarrassment of another utility bankruptcy on his watch, but currently backs
a
scheme ginned up by Assembly Democratic leaders. Edison, however, has split
with
Davis and now favors an alternative offered by Republicans and some moderate
Democrats - one that consumer advocates denounced as a corporate bailout.
Meanwhile, liberal senators are pushing another version that Edison likes even
less, but its critics among consumer activists like more.

With both lawmakers and outside interest groups so widely scattered over
what, if anything, should be done to rescue Edison, a consensus developed late
Thursday to keep the vehicles alive with preliminary floor votes, but continue
private negotiations through the month-long vacation recess.

The many-sided stalemate stems from both the rivals plans' provisions -
farmers, for example, fear environmentalists' gaining authority through the
state over Edison-owned watershed in the Sierra - and the convoluted dynamics
of
the Capitol.

Legislative leadership is very weak in the era of term limits, especially in
the Assembly, and lawmakers are leery about voting for any complex utility
measure, particularly one that might raise rates. Some call it "1890 disease"
for the number of the 1996 deregulation bill that backfired so badly.

Then, too, some liberals and consumer activists appear to want all of the
measures to fail, forcing Edison into bankruptcy court. Then, they believe,
the
newly created but still inactive state power authority could step in, using
its
$5 billion in untapped bonding authority, and pick up assets of the utilities
on
the cheap, thus creating a massive state utility system.

Wheels within wheels, and none of them meshing.

Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy
Former governor defends himself

Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy
deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for
failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency
powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis.
"There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis
on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics
and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday.
Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in
jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic
governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to
blur perception of the current energy troubles.
"They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And
they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush,"
said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a
triumph -- for Davis."
But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power."
Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis
-- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank,
released polls showing Californians now believe energy ranks far and away as
the state's most pressing problem. Many of those voters blame Wilson, not
Davis, for the power shortages and rolling blackouts, the poll shows.
The former governor's sharp words were rejected by Davis' senior political
adviser, Garry South, who said Wilson is trying to "revise history."
"If there is one shred of evidence that Pete Wilson said one thing or raised
one red flag about energy supply, let him produce it," South said yesterday.
"Pete Wilson accusing Gov. Davis of being responsible (for energy) is like
Herbert Hoover blaming FDR for the Depression. We're trying to clean up his
mess."
The GOP former two-term governor spoke on the issue of California energy as
members of the Bush administration fanned out across the nation, including a
California trip by Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham, to push the White
House's energy policy.
But even the president appeared to point the finger at Wilson for some of
California's problems. "They hadn't built a power plant in 12 years" in
California, Bush told reporters Wednesday. "And guess what? When you grow
your state the way they have . . . it creates problems."
Such words chafe Wilson, who produced California Energy Commission figures
that, he said, showed that small plants were built during his administration.
In fact, he argued, the 1996 deregulation bill encouraged energy producers to
seek state approval for new plants.
While acknowledging the 1996 bill he signed was "flawed," Wilson said, "I
thought the flaws would be addressed."
"We knew it was not a perfect free market mechanism," said Wilson, adding
that he had strong reservations about the utility rate caps included in the
legislation. "(That) was a gamble, but it was one that paid off for while."
But, he insisted, the bill -- which critics say kicked off California's
energy woes -- had benefits for the state.
Wilson said it was believed deregulation would spur private industry to build
new plants that would fuel industry and "lots of jobs for Californians."
Deregulation was also seen as a means to balance power companies' concerns
about a lengthy, "nightmarish" process -- which he said dated to the early
1970s -- to build large power plants.
Davis "is now posing in front of those plants" opening because of decisions
made before he took office, Wilson noted. "I hope that he's pleased with our
handiwork."
Wilson, also lambasted Davis for failing to heed 1998 warnings from the
California Energy Commission about coming blackouts.
And, Wilson said, as the state faced rolling blackouts, job losses, and
skyrocketing energy costs, Davis failed to use one of his greatest tools in a
crisis: emergency powers.
Wilson noted that after the 1994 Northridge earthquake, estimates suggested
it would take 2 1/2 years to rebuild downed freeways and overpasses. He used
his emergency powers to offer incentives to contractors that rebuilt the
bridges within 65 days.
South, noting that Davis has used his emergency powers to deal with the
energy crisis, said there is no comparison between an earthquake and a full-
blown statewide energy crisis.

PG&E announces deals with smaller suppliers


(Published July 20, 2001)
SAN FRANCISCO -- Two weeks after reaching a long-term agreement with a major
electricity supplier, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. on Thursday announced
similar pacts with 130 smaller alternative energy companies.
The deals, which must be submitted to a federal bankruptcy judge for
approval, are expected to provide about 1,600 megawatts at 5.37 cents per
kilowatt hour -- a price set by the Public Utilities Commission for long-term
agreements sealed by July 15. The total is about two-thirds of the
electricity that the utility usually receives under contracts with
alternative energy suppliers.
The utility has promised to repay the 131 companies the $740 million it owes
them when its plan goes into effect.
It owes an additional $260 million to other small producers who have not
settled. Some of those companies are trying to get out of PG&E contracts.
--Claire Cooper
County sues over bond sale
Monterey County officials sued the county's investment adviser for selling
them $4.9 million in Pacific Gas and Electric Co. bonds as the utility was
collapsing financially.
PG&E defaulted on the bonds, which came due March 26, although it has paid
the county $5,334 in interest, the county said in its lawsuit.
The lawsuit, filed in San Francisco Superior Court, says Banc of America
Securities sold the bonds to Monterey County on Dec. 11 even though the
county "was seeking a conservative, low risk investment."
At the time, the securities firm was aware that PG&E "was financially
unstable and its securities subject to potential default," the lawsuit says.
BofA Securities said the PG&E bonds were "similar in risk to investment in a
certificate of deposit and less risky than an investment in treasury bonds,"
the suit says.
BofA Securities couldn't be reached for comment.

Dan Walters: Six months later, utility debts are still the toughest nut to

(Published July 20, 2001)

California selling surplus power at fraction of cost it paid


\
objattph
By Karen Gaudette ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 19, 2001  SAN FRANCISCO ) California
has begun selling power for a fraction of its purchase price as cool weather
creates an abundance of electricity, spending that has been criticized by
some watching the state's power crisis closely.  Power the state bought at an
average of $138 per megawatt is being sold for as little as $1, energy
traders say, though the price is disputed by state officials.  The state
acknowleges the power sales, but says the surplus represented only a blip in
an otherwise typical scorching summer and that blackouts still could roll if
temperatures increase again.

However, the surplus power selloff could encourage criticism that the state
bought too much power at too high a price in its haste to fend off rolling
blackouts and power prices 10 times higher than the year before.  "If the
price is $138 on average for a month and you have to turn around and sell a
chunk of it for a dollar, you're not going to look real good to a number of
people," said Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading
Forum in San Jose.  "I just don't think many people in California truly
understood what their state did when they stepped into this business."
Unlike natural gas, extra electricity cannot be stored away for a later day.
Since Californians haven't been running their air conditioners as often as
expected over the past week, the state hasn't needed the entire 38,000
megawatts it had figured it would need.  The state Department of Water
Resources, in charge of buying power for three financially ailing utilities,
has spent the past few months arming the state with long-term energy
contracts while weaning itself away from buying the highest-priced power on
the last-minute electricity market.  Those contracts, along with last month's
20 percent boost in energy conservation and the temperate weather, mean
there's suddenly more power than Californians can use.  Energy traders say
the state has tried to sell as much as 6,000 megawatts at one time, Ackerman
said.  That's around 16 percent of the 38,000 megawatts the state estimated
it would use around this time of year, Ackerman said. A megawatt is enough
electricity to power roughly 750 homes.  "We know from traders who have
bought that it's gone as low as a dollar and last week we know it was as low
as $5," Ackerman said. "When a seller shows up with an enormous amount of
power for sale and the market knows it, it has a depressing effect on
prices."  California Energy Markets, a trade weekly, said the state sold
power last Thursday at $25 per megawatt ) a price that Steve Maviglio, a
spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis, said was "much closer to reality."  The state
"never sold anything more than 1,000 megawatts on any single day," Maviglio
said. "(Ackerman) has no evidence" of California selling power for $1,
Maviglio said. "California Energy Markets is much closer to reality."  Oscar
Hidalgo, a DWR spokesman, acknowledged the state has been trying to sell as
much as 20 percent of its daily megawatts, though he would not say at what
price. That could put the state at a disadvantage in the market if
competitors knew how much it was paying, Hidalgo said.  "This is unusual, but
it was anticipated, it is typical in the power buying operation," Hidalgo
said.  "It's better than doing nothing with surplus power," Hidalgo said.
"Scheduling energy is a balancing act because you can't store the item."
Hidalgo said the state is sending some of the extra electricity up to the
Bonneville Power Administration to repay it for power it had loaned
California earlier this year.  "This is not a bad position for us to be in
every once in a while," Hidalgo said. "If someone were to make these
long-term contracts go away, we would fall off a cliff and be back where we
were in January."




PUC reveals plan to transfer much of watchdog role


\
objattph
By Craig D. Rose  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  The California
Public Utilities Commission laid out a framework yesterday for transferring
much of its watchdog role in ensuring fair electricity rates to the state
Department of Water Resources.  The controversial proposal is in response to
legislation earlier this year that puts the water department in charge of
state power purchases. Utilities commission action is needed to ensure that
the water department has enough revenue to make the purchases and to clarify
areas of responsibility, including oversight of power rates.  Under the draft
agreement made public yesterday, the commission would guarantee that
consumers pay enough to cover interest payments on a planned $13.4 billion
bond sale later this year. The guarantee is considered an essential element
for completing the bond sale.  The bonds' proceeds are needed to repay some
$8 billion the water department already has spent to purchase electricity and
to cover future payments.  California began buying electricity through the
water department earlier this year after the state's utilities were unable to
make purchases because of credit problems brought on by the state's failed
deregulation plan.  No mention was made in the draft agreement of the
possibility of further rate increases to cover electricity purchases. Some
observers have speculated that the current rate structure, even after two
rounds of rate increases, may not cover all costs.  On the other hand, the
draft agreement states that the water department itself will determine if the
prices it pays for electricity meet the legal test of being just and
reasonable, a determination heretofore made by the utilities commission.
Under the utilities commission's procedure, the public is invited to comment
on the draft. An administrative law judge for the commission will consider
the draft before issuing a proposed decision. A full commission vote is
expected Aug. 23, a deadline that would have to be met if the bond offering
is to proceed as planned later this year.  Harvey Rosenfield, president of
the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, said the utilities
commission's draft agreement would allow a "secretive agency of dubious
competence controlled by the governor and completely unaccountable to the
public" to unilaterally order rate increases.  "It was deregulation which got
us into the mess we are in today," Rosenfield said. "Now Wall Street is
demanding that the (utilities commission) be forced to surrender its
authority and legal responsibility."  He urged the commission to reject the
draft proposal.  Carl Wood, one of five members of the Public Utilities
Commission, said the draft agreement was driven largely by legislation
empowering the water department as an electricity purchaser. With a state
department buying power, Wood said, oversight shifts to the governor and the
Legislature.  Commissioner Richard Bilas said he saw the agreement as
empowering the water department as "prosecutor, judge and jury" in matters of
electricity purchasing.  "The argument is that it's better off this way than
the way we were," Bilas said. "And that's true in the short run. But what
about in the long term?"




Variety of plans to help Edison find friends, foes


\
objattph
Agreement in Legislature doesn't seem likely soon By Ed Mendel  UNION-TRIBUNE
STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  SACRAMENTO -- Plans to aid Southern California
Edison met mixed fates in legislative committees yesterday amid opposition
from business, consumers and Edison itself, which said one of the plans would
not restore its ability to borrow money.  The Senate energy committee
rejected a plan that is tough on Edison, but the committee plans to consider
it again today.  In the Assembly, a committee approved two plans. One has the
support of Democratic leaders, is viewed more favorably by Gov. Gray Davis
and has not drawn opposition from Edison. The other, crafted by the committee
chairman, Rod Wright, D-Los Angeles, and Republicans, is supported by
businesses and Edison.  Senate President Pro Tempore John Burton, D-San
Francisco, told an Edison official during a committee hearing that financial
experts have told him repeatedly that bankruptcy is the logical course for
Edison.  "They keep saying they don't understand why a business in your
situation does not avail themselves of that," Burton said.  The Senate leader
told the Edison official not to expect the usual legislative compromises that
would give the utility most of what it is seeking in a rescue plan.  "I want
to disabuse you of the fact that somehow you are going to get some great big
deal at the end of the rainbow," Burton said. "Because you are not going
to."  The Senate and Assembly Democratic leadership plans require businesses
to pay off most or all of Edison's debt, while also preventing businesses
from shopping around for cheaper power. Business groups oppose the plans
because of those provisions.  Davis is pushing for a legislative plan that
would keep Edison from joining Pacific Gas and Electric in bankruptcy. He
wants an Edison rescue plan that could become a model for getting PG&E out of
bankruptcy.  Once their financial health is restored, the utilities could
resume buying power for their customers, allowing the state to get out of the
power-buying business it entered in January, when the utilities were crippled
by a failed deregulation plan and no longer able to borrow money.  But the
lengthy and sometimes emotional debates in legislative committees yesterday
made it clear that reaching an agreement on an Edison rescue plan in the next
few days will not be easy.  A plan that Davis negotiated with Edison in early
April found little support in the Legislature and is not being considered.
Opponents said the plan was too generous to Edison.  But the alternative
rescue plans prepared in the Legislature also are called too generous to
Edison by a consumer group, the Foundation for Consumer and Taxpayer Rights,
which is threatening to put an initiative on the ballot to repeal any Edison
"bailout."  Edison, on the other hand, fears that it will be saddled with too
much debt and placed under a regulatory system that does not assure lenders
that the utility will be able to pay costs for operating and buying equipment
and power.  "We don't believe this bill in its present form would restore us
to creditworthiness," Bob Foster, an Edison vice president, told a committee
hearing the Senate plan.  The plan by Wright and Republicans was supported by
business groups and Edison but opposed by consumers. All ratepayers would pay
off the Edison debt and businesses would be allowed to shop for cheaper power
as state long-term contracts expire.  "What will come out of the mix is hard
to tell," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "Everyone is working
feverishly to get something passed in the next few days."






Baja is hoping energy squeeze can spark boom

New electricity, gas plants seen spurring a fresh wave of growth By Diane
Lindquist  UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER  July 19, 2001  Energy shortages in
California and Mexico are firing hopes for a new wave of industrial
development in Baja California, where a maquiladora slowdown has cut
thousands of jobs.  The power squeeze has triggered a rush to build
electricity and natural gas projects in Baja California.  Once those plants
are up and running, energy experts and Tijuana boosters say, the state will
be able to make an unusual pitch to global manufacturers: Come to Baja
California, where power is plentiful, reliable and relatively cheap.  "It's a
new frontier for Baja California," said Institute of the Americas president
Paul Boeker, a frontier that "opens up investment opportunities that aren't
possible at the moment."  To seize the possibilities, Tijuana's Economic
Development Corp. is pushing the Baja California government to fund a study
to identify the United States' biggest electricity and natural gas users.
"When we saw the price of energy going up so high in California, we thought
we might be able to use this as a marketing tool," said David Mayagoitia, a
director of the development group.  The hope is that an influx of big-energy
users, such as high-tech firms that operate clean rooms, will offset serious
problems in the region's sputtering maquiladora industry.  Since October,
Baja California has lost 11,700 maquiladora jobs, 4 percent of the sector's
total. In Tijuana alone, 7,600 positions have disappeared.  "I've never seen
so many large and small and medium companies narrow their operations in such
a short amount of time," said Deloitte & Touche accountant Mauricio Munroy.
Maquiladora insiders like Munroy blame the U.S. economic downturn, rising
costs, a strong peso and a new Mexican regulatory regime for reining in the
operations.  Mayagoitia calls it a crisis.  "Our labor costs are going up.
We're not as competitive as other places in the world. We have to look for
other angles."  Over the past three decades, the arrival of foreign-owned
maquiladoras has pushed Baja California's population to 2.5 million and
transformed the state into one of the world's manufacturing hot spots. The
region now ranks as a top producer of televisions and other consumer
electronic products, and many other goods.  There are 1,287 factories in the
state, employing 278,900 workers.  New operators continue to come. Since
October, when employment began dropping, 33 companies have established
factories in the state. Other companies, including Korean electronics giant
Samsung, the state's largest operator, are expanding.  But in the past nine
months, the sector's growth has dropped below its routine double-digit rate.
Some companies, such as Sanyo and Day Runner, have shut factories. Others are
threatening to. And so many have trimmed operations that Munroy said, "I
don't think we can feel comfortable the industry's going to recover."  But
now, California's energy crisis and cross-border power demands could alter
that picture. A natural gas pipeline and three power plants in the works will
boost the state's electricity output by 2,200 megawatts. As much as 1,500
megawatts could flow to California consumers.  Additional plants are
anticipated. Mexican Energy Secretary Ernesto Martens has said there's no
limit to the number that could be built in Baja California. And California
and Mexican officials are considering recruiting energy companies to start
projects in Baja California.  Meanwhile, numerous companies -- El Paso and
Phillips, Sempra, Chevron and Chiyoda among them -- have expressed interest
in building liquid natural gas facilities near Rosarito and Ensenada. The
operations would convert into vapor form liquified natural gas imported from
other regions for use in Mexico and the United States.  Such projects could
give Baja California billions of dollars in investment, thousands of
construction and operating jobs, and a reputation as an energy-abundant place
to do business.  "Large energy consumers could come down here, set up
operations and get a big break on their utilities," Mayagoitia said.
Previously, such operators have shunned Baja California.  "They've always
said electricity down here is not constant. There are too many fluctuations
on the line," Mayagoitia said.  While a bigger supply would overcome that
obstacle, other challenges must be met before the region can use energy as a
marketing tool.  At a San Diego Dialogue forum on energy last week, Boeker
listed the key elements needed to attract the next wave of industrial
development to Baja California. As he sees it, they need at least one liquid
natural gas import facility, to allow power generators to export to
California and sell directly to companies in Baja California, and to upgrade
the cross-border gas and electricity transmission infrastructure.  Mexico
also needs to make sure its business laws and regulations, which in the past
have restricted the energy sector, allow corporations to get the supplies and
prices they need to be competitive, Mayagoitia said.  "We think if the
numbers make sense, and they have confidence that Mexico can deliver what
they need, then we'll have the market niche."






GOP pushes energy bill with billions in tax breaks, emphasis on coal, oil,
nuclear power


\
objattph
By H. Josef Hebert ASSOCIATED PRESS  July 19, 2001  WASHINGTON ) House
Republican leaders hope to pass a broad energy package in the coming weeks
that offers billions of dollars in tax breaks and favors for the coal, oil
and nuclear industries as well as conservation incentives.  Much of the
legislation, which emerged in bits and pieces this week from four House
committees, mirrors ) and in some cases goes beyond ) the energy blueprint
outlined by President Bush two months ago.  House GOP leaders have promised
to enact energy legislation before Congress leaves for its summer recess in
August.  The energy package includes drilling in an Arctic wildlife refuge, a
top priority of the White House; incentives for technology to allow continued
use of coal for power production; and tax breaks for high-mileage hybrid
gas-electric automobiles.  But in some cases, the House committees have
cleared measures not even sought by the administration.  Within one of the
energy bills is a provision giving some of the largest, most profitable oil
companies a waiver on having to pay the government royalties on oil and gas
taken from new lease areas in the Gulf of Mexico. During the presidential
campaign, Bush opposed such a royalty waiver, which critics claim amounts to
a $7.3 billion windfall to the oil companies.  The House tax-writing
committee, meanwhile, produced $33.5 billion worth of energy-related tax
breaks ) a much broader sweep of tax incentives than Bush has sought ) even
though some Democrats wondered whether there will be money available.  About
half the tax breaks would go to oil, gas and coal industries and an
additional $9 billion was earmarked to promote conservation and energy
efficiency  Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., chairman of the Ways and Means
Committee, said the aim was to produced "a balanced package of tax measures"
that helps conservation and development of energy supplies.  But the breath
of the tax incentives went far beyond those proposed by the White House
energy task force headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.  In addition to tax
breaks for clean coal initiatives, refineries, pipelines and nuclear power
plants, the committee also approved tax credits on a wide range of
conservation programs, from helping to sell hybrid-fueled cars to making it
cheaper to insulate homes, buy residential solar panels, reduce energy use in
commercial buildings and develop and sell more efficient appliances.  Still,
"overall the (legislative) package is disappointing," said David Nemtzow,
president of the Alliance to Save Energy, a private energy conservation
advocacy group.  While Nemtzow praised the tax writers for some of their
provisions, he said big-ticket energy saving items ) such as a major increase
in automobile fuel economy and tougher appliance standards ) were largely
rejected in other energy legislation advanced to the House floor this week.
The disagreements over energy efficiency, a fight Democrats pledged to
continue when the legislation is considered by the full House, was apparent
during the Energy and Commerce Committee's crafting of its energy bill.  A
proposal to boost the federal corporate average fuel economy standard, or
CAFE, from the current 27.5 mpg to 37.5 mpg was soundly defeated, 43-11.
Another fuel economy increase and an attempt to force the Bush administration
to accept a more stringent federal air conditioner standard also fell by
similar margins.  Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., the committee chairman, dismissed
the criticism. He called the legislation that emerged from committee by a
50-5 vote a "landmark conservation bill" that for the first time in years has
Congress taking steps to increase motor vehicle fuel economy.  The bill
requires that CAFE standards for light trucks be adjusted to reduce gasoline
consumption by new sport utility vehicles and minivans by 5 billion gallons
over six years. Critics called that far too little, noting that the gasoline
savings over six years would amount to about what all cars and trucks consume
in two weeks.  The Bush administration's biggest victory came in the
Resources Committee, where Democrats failed 19-29 to strip the legislation of
a provision that would allow oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge in northeastern Alaska.  Opponents vowed to kill the provision on the
House floor, where Democrats will be joined by many moderate Republicans in
opposing it. Senate Democrats also have said no Arctic refuge drilling
measure would pass.  Nevertheless, Rep. James Hansen, R-Utah, sponsor of the
legislation, said he was optimistic. "It's a selling job," he said, noting
that with the various energy bills before the full House, "we're now down to
serious business."








Edison May Avert Bankruptcy Filing
Energy: Thanks to a rate increase and natural gas price drop, the utility's
improved cash flow may cover its electricity costs.
By JERRY HIRSCH
Times Staff Writer

July 20 2001

For the first time in months, Southern California Edison is collecting more
money than it is spending on electricity, a shift that could enable the
utility to avoid bankruptcy without a state intervention as dramatic as the
proposed $2.8-billion purchase of the company's transmission lines.

The turnabout has come during the last several weeks as natural gas prices--a
major component in the cost of electricity--have plummeted and as Edison has
collected more money from customers through a record increase in rates
approved by state regulators.

The utility this month expects to collect more than it will spend on
electricity--the first time that has happened since the state's power crunch
started in May 2000. If the trend holds, Edison would be able to cover
several hundred million dollars in losses that piled up after Feb. 1 from its
purchases of electricity, said executives at the Rosemead-based company.

Edison's relief comes against a backdrop in which the California power crisis
appears to be easing, as consumers conserve energy, new power plants come
online and wholesale prices moderate from the high levels of last winter.

The executives said that barring an unusually severe heat wave, which would
prompt customers to crank up energy-guzzling air conditioners, or another
spike in natural gas prices, Edison by early next year also could make
payments on a proposed bond offering to pay down its $3.5 billion in debt
from energy purchases before Feb. 1.

Creditors of the utility and consultants working with the governor's office
agree that such a scenario could mean that Edison would be able to stay out
of U.S. Bankruptcy Court without the state buying the company's transmission
lines, which is a key element in Gov. Gray Davis' now-stalled proposal to
rescue the utility.

Jim Scilacci, the utility's chief financial officer, has hinted at improving
company finances during conference calls with creditors holding $931 million
in defaulted bonds and notes in recent weeks. Investors have responded
positively, boosting the company's depressed stock price about 45% in the
last six weeks to a Thursday close of $14.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.

Although Edison's cash flow may be enough to cover its electricity costs, its
huge debts keep it far from solvency. Moreover, the company still faces two
wild cards in its fight to avoid bankruptcy: California's own claims on that
cash and the utility's uncertain prospects of gaining state approval to use
the money to repay its debts.

The Department of Water Resources is buying electricity for 27 million
Californians served by Edison and the state's two other regulated utilities.
The agency could disclose as soon as today how big a slice it will take from
Edison's rate collections to repay a proposed $13.4-billion bond offering to
cover the state's purchases.

The water agency began buying electricity from private generators in January,
after Edison and Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the Northern California utility,
became mired in debt. PG&E went on to file for bankruptcy protection in April.

"What this means for Edison all depends on how much money it can keep," said
Paul Patterson, an analyst with investment bank ABN Amro in New York.

The water department's requirements could eat up much of the margin that has
provided Edison with its small cushion this month. However, Joseph Fichera,
chief executive of Saber Partners, which is advising the governor, said the
latest numbers indicate that there is enough money in current rates to
implement the governor's plan to pay for the utility's debt as well as the
state's current and future power purchases.

Even if the water department allocation still left room for Edison to pay off
its debts, such a course of action would require approval by the state
Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission. Although energy trends
appear to allow the utility to regain its financial footing, analysts
cautioned that the utility still could find itself in Bankruptcy Court if the
state doesn't provide a method for Edison to pay its debts.

"While we might be able to cover our costs going forward, it is equally
important that we have a way to pay off that $3.5-billion debt," said Brian
Bennett, an Edison vice president. "But without knowing what [the water
department's] revenue needs are, we won't know what is left over in rates to
cover our costs."

Bennett blamed the utility's so-called under-collection--debts that piled up
as frozen consumer rates could not cover soaring wholesale electricity
costs--on what he called "flawed regulatory policies."

Based on recent energy prices, Bennett said, "We are just only beginning to
repay the under-collection."

The recently enacted rate increases, which kicked in last month, have pushed
what Edison can charge customers for the electricity component of their bills
from about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour to 10.27 cents.

At the same time, declining natural gas prices have sliced in half what the
utility must pay to a group of small and alternative-energy companies that
generate about 27% of its electricity needs. Edison, for example, paid this
group 18.6 cents a kilowatt-hour in February. That dropped to 13.6 cents by
May and now stands at about 7.5 cents. Each penny decline in the cost of
electricity from this group of generators represents more than $200 million
in savings for Edison on an annual basis.

Bennett cautioned that if the water department requires additional funds or
if Edison's energy costs were to turn upward again, "then rates once again
may not be adequate to cover our generation costs. It is therefore imperative
that this uncertainty in the rate structure be cured now so we establish
predictable, stable rates for our customers."

Three plans to aid Edison to varying degrees are working their way through
the Legislature, though late Thursday it appeared none would be approved
before lawmakers adjourn for a summer recess. Several legislators have said
they are content to let Edison join PG&E in bankruptcy.

Any plan that would allow Edison to use a portion of the rates it is
collecting to pay off a bond offering would meet the objection of some
consumer groups, which label the concept a corporate bailout.

"Just as the utilities gambled on deregulation and were winners at first,
Edison now has to be responsible for its losses," said Harvey Rosenfield,
president of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica.
He said Bankruptcy Court is the most appropriate place for Edison to resolve
its financial problems.

Several creditors of the utility, however, said that as long as Edison can
tread water or even work down its debts, there is little incentive to put the
company into bankruptcy, which would only add another legal layer and more
expenses to an exceptionally complicated situation.

Creditors could move against the company if they believed its finances were
declining and thus shrinking the amount of cash and assets that could be
distributed in a bankruptcy proceeding. They also could put Edison into
involuntary bankruptcy if some creditors exacted payment from the company
ahead of others that are owed money.

Summer blackout seers missing the mark -- so far
Blackout visions only bad dreams
WHAT OUTAGES? State efforts paying off
Joe Garofoli, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:jgarofoli@sfchronicle.com>

Months ago, the experts said there might be a blackout today.
If not today, then probably this week.
Well, most likely this month.
If not, then for sure sometime this summer, so Californians had better unplug
the toaster and pray for rain because there are going to be 260 hours of
blackouts this summer. Or more.
It's starting to feel like the day after Y2K around here.
An unexpected thing happened on the way to California's summer of darkness -
- nothing. Zero blackouts this summer, thanks to Gray-friendly skies and
Californians conserving power in record amounts.
Now the state is so flush with power that it's selling back the surplus at a
loss. Even Disneyland has cranked up its flashy Electrical Parade again.
Still, the doomsayers aren't backpedaling, merely clarifying their fevered
springtime predictions. Like Michael Zenker, of Cambridge Research
Associates.
"I think (the reporter) was asking me to speculate," Zenker said of his
comment in May that there could be hundreds of hours of darkness this summer.
Officially, he said, his organization predicted 20 to 40 hours of blackouts.
And it doesn't plan to adjust that figure. "We've decided not to do any live
forecasting," Zenker said.
Who knew what the summer would bring? Not California's power officials. The
state's Department of Water Resources was in such a blackout-fearing frenzy
earlier this year that it purchased too much power. So, over the past few
days,
the state has been forced to sell power it bought for as much $133 per
megawatt for between $15 and $30, department spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said
yesterday.
"If you would have told us last winter that there would be a week in July
that there would be a surplus of power, a lot of people would have had smiles
on their faces," Hidalgo said.
That isn't the only fallout from the summer of surprising light. A group of
California business and development leaders worries that the rest of the
country is asking the same misinformed question as your Aunt Minnie in
Cleveland: "How do all you people in California work by candlelight all the
time?"
That kind of ignorance cost a Hewlett-Packard manufacturing plant in
Roseville some business two months ago. A longtime Midwestern customer was so
afraid that his company's order wouldn't be filled on time because of
blackouts that he sent his business to an HP plant in California's energy
nemesis: Texas.
"If that company thought that way, then how many others back East are
thinking that way?" said Ken Larson, a spokesman for Hewlett-Packard. He is
helping a $150,000, six-month promotional campaign called the Power of
California, which will send economic and business leaders across the country
to counter the misrepresentation that blackouts are a part of daily life in
the Golden State. The campaign is being funded mostly with private money.
Looking back, there was no shortage of blackout Henny Pennys last spring.
The North American Electrical Reliability Council predicted 260 hours of
darkness. The Bay Area Economic Council said there would be a blackout every
business day this summer.
Neither organization regrets yelling "Blackout!" in a crowded state.
"At the time (March), there was good reason to expect that things would be
that bad," said Sean Randolph, president of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a
group of public and private leaders.
"Without that elevation of public consciousness, we wouldn't have gotten the
demand change (conservation) that we expected."
Others resorted to two favorite scapegoats: the weather and the media.
"The headlines on blackouts were around last summer," said Ellen Vancko, a
spokeswoman for the North American Electrical Reliability Council in New
Jersey. "You should check out your own paper."
Besides, Vancko said, nobody could have predicted that temperatures would
remain at or below average in California's major cities.
Actually, temperatures were 1.3 degrees above normal at San Francisco
International Airport in June and 3 degrees above normal in most Central
Valley cities. And yet, no blackouts.
Nearly every forecaster cautions that summer is only half over and the
hottest part of the season lies ahead.
"Conservation is still important," said Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for
the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state's power
grid. She offered a prediction on when Californians could relax about the
threat of blackouts.
"At the first frost," she said. "November, maybe?"

State advisers forced to sell energy stocks
CONFLICT: Holdings called unethical
Mark Martin, Chronicle Staff Writer <mailto:mmartin@sfchronicle.com>

Sacramento -- One consultant hired by the state to negotiate long-term
electricity contracts owned stock in a company that signed billion-dollar
deals with California.
Another fresh hire bought more than $10,000 in stock in Enron Corp. -- the
Houston power trader frequently vilified by Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers --
as he helped the state develop electricity buying strategy.
A top Davis lawyer told the two consultants and seven others on Wednesday
morning to sell off stock in companies like Enron and Calpine Corp. within
four hours or lose their jobs.
Having a financial interest in electric companies while working for the state
on power issues was not ethical, said Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs
secretary, in a memo.
All nine complied with the directive, said Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio
said, but controversy intensified yesterday over whether some of the state's
hired guns managing the energy crisis have conflicts of interest.
The stock investments have come to light in the past week as 35 consultants
hired by the state to buy and schedule power and to negotiate energy
contracts have submitted documents detailing their personal finances.
Most of the consultants who owned stock list their jobs as schedulers --
those who schedule electricity deliveries after power has been purchased.
But others more directly involved with power trading also owned stock in
energy companies, documents show.
Richard Ferreira earns $200 an hour to help negotiate and manage the state's
long-term contracts with power companies. He started his job Jan. 31.
According to Ferreira's financial statement, he owned between $2,000 and
$10,000 worth of stock in Calpine Corp. -- the company based in San Jose that
announced on Feb. 28 it had signed two long-term contracts with the state
worth $8.3 billion.
Ferreira could not be reached for comment, and spokesmen for the Department
of Water Resources, which hired the consultants, said he did not know if
Ferreira worked on the Calpine contracts.
Another consultant, Richard Nichols, bought between $10,000 and $100,000
worth of stock in Enron in April -- more than three months after his company
signed on with the state to help "in the procurement of power supplies,"
according to his job description. The stock buy came at a time when the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was taking a hard line against wholesale
electricity price caps for California.
Nichols' company, Navigant Consulting, Inc., could make as much as $800,000
for its work for the state this year. Nichols could not be reached for
comment.
Citing invoices from Controller Kathleen Connell's office, Secretary of State
Bill Jones, an announced GOP candidate for governor, argued that there are at
least seven other Navigant employees who are billing the state for work on
energy issues. None of them have disclosed their financial interests.
Jones said he takes issue with the Davis administration's decisions on who
should file financial statements and who should be exempt.
FINANCES NOT DISCLOSED
Several consultants, including two Wall Street firms that made $275,000 a
month to negotiate the state's attempts to bail out troubled public
utilities, have not disclosed their finances because Davis officials have
concluded they do not fit the definition of a consultant.
Jones has suggested that the state's long-term deals with several companies
to deliver electricity might be invalid if negotiators had a financial stake
in those companies.
Maviglio said Davis officials were investigating whether there had been any
direct conflicts. The state attorney general's office and the state's Fair
Political Practices Commission also are reviewing Jones' allegations.
Maviglio and a spokesman for the state's Department of Water and Power could
not say yesterday whether new employees were asked before they were hired
whether they had any financial stake in the energy market.
STOCKS SOLD VOLUNTARILY
But some consultants acknowledged a potential conflict and got rid of stocks
before this week. In his filing, Mark Skowdronski reports owning more than
$10,000 worth of Reliant Energy stocks when he began his job in March of
negotiating long-term contracts for the state. When he was given the task of
negotiating with Reliant, he said he sold his stock on March 20.
Jones has stopped short of accusing anyone of criminal activity. And a letter
from Attorney General Bill Lockyer to Jones notes that the consultants would
have to own more than 3 percent of a company they dealt with to be prosecuted
criminally.
Maviglio said the accusations come from a man who is launching his run for
Davis' job next year.
"This is all politics," said Steve Maviglio, Davis' press secretary. "We're
following the law."
He said that when the state was forced to enter the business of buying power
earlier this year, officials had to quickly hire people who knew the energy
business, including some who still had investments in power companies.
"If you want a plumber, you hire a guy who has plumbing experience," Maviglio
said.

Democrats defy Davis with bill on PUC
Utilities panel would keep power over rates

MN222719.DTL>
Sacramento -- Lawmakers moved with lightning speed yesterday to undo a plan
that would force California regulators to raise electricity rates whenever
state power buyers deem it necessary.
A hastily introduced bill pits Democratic lawmakers against the
administration of Gov. Gray Davis, which is counting on the state Public
Utilities Commission to approve rate increases to pay for electricity without
questioning whether the state got a good price.
Historically, utilities bought their electricity and asked the PUC to approve
rate hikes. The PUC decided whether the requests were justified.
But with the utilities now deeply in debt and the state buying electricity,
the old system has broken down. This week, the PUC issued a draft agreement
that would guarantee the state would get as much money as it needs to pay for
the electricity it is buying.
Consumer advocates said the proposed agreement would force the PUC to cede
its responsibility to protect customers from unreasonable rate increases.
Senate leader John Burton, D-San Francisco, called the agreement
"overreaching" by the governor's Department of Water Resources, which is
buying the state's power.
Under Burton's bill, consumers would still have to repay $13.4 billion in
bonds that the state plans to float to cover its purchases. But the bill
would allow the PUC to scrutinize the state's expenses beyond those covered
by the bond -- costs mounting to billions of dollars over the next 15 to 20
years.
The bill passed out of two committees with bipartisan support yesterday and
now faces a vote by the full Senate. Both business and consumer groups
expressed their support for the measure.
"This is better for ratepayers," said Lenny Goldberg of the Utility Reform
Network. "It makes the bond issue secure and gives a chance to look into all
of the contracts."
PUC Commissioner Richard Bilas said some change is needed to restore
commission oversight.
"The only check and balance on the Department of Water Resources as it is
would be the governor," Bilas said. "I think it takes a different branch of
government to do that oversight."
But Bruce Van Dusen, a lawyer hired by the Department of Water Resources,
said Burton's bill could delay the bond sale and jeopardize the general fund.
The concern is that while Burton's bill guarantees that the bond issue would
be repaid, it does not spell out how all the long-term electricity contracts
that the state has signed will be covered. The contracts stipulate that the
generators will be paid through electricity rates.

Davis' plan, announced in April, offers Edison $2.76 billion for its
transmission system and lets the utility issue revenue bonds to repay the
rest of their debts. Edison is estimated to have amassed $3.5 billion in
debts from record-high wholesale electricity prices to customers. A competing
bill by Speaker Robert Hertzberg, D-Van Nuys, and Assemblyman Fred Keeley,
D-Boulder Creek, would trims at least $300 million from the governor's offer,
and also would allow Edison to issue the bonds, which would be repaid by
Edison ratepayers over a decade.
* Pacific Gas and Electric Co. decides to extend contracts to buy electricity
from 131 small power plants for the next five years, the utility announced
Thursday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court. As part of the deal, the utility also will
pay those power plants $740 million for unpaid electricity deliveries they
had made to PG&E before it filed for federal bankruptcy protection on April
6. The power plants throughout the state, which largely harness energy from
the sun, wind, biomass and natural gas to produce electricity in
environmentally friendly ways, agreed to supply PG&E with nearly 3,000
megawatts of power for 5.37 cents per kilowatt hour on average.
* Assemblyman John Campbell sends a letter to the director of the Department
of Water Resources, demanding to know how much surplus power the state is
selling and at what price. Since January, the state has bought electricity
for the customers of three financially ailing utilities. Cooler July
temperatures than expected have led to a sudden surplus of power, which
energy traders say is being sold for more than $100 less than it was bought.
State officials say the extra power shows the state planned ahead well, and
that if the weather heats up, it will be prepared.
* In sharp contrast to a poll released in May, Californians now say that
although the state needs power, nuclear energy is not a safe enough source.
The poll, released Thursday by the Public Policy Institute of California,
showed that 55 percent of residents believe nuclear power is too dangerous,
even if building more nuclear power plants would help alleviate the country's
energy problems. In a Field Institute poll of 1,015 adults released in May,
59 percent of Californians favored nuclear power and 36 percent were opposed.
* PG&E Corp. shares rise 30 cents to close at $15.40. Shares of Edison
International rise 25 cents to close at $14.70. Sempra shares rise 65 cents
to close at $27.12.
* No power alerts Thursday as electricity reserves stay above 7 percent.
* The Senate and Assembly are expected to vote on competing versions of deals
to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy. Legislators are trying
to clear their agendas before leaving for a monthlong summer break.
WHAT'S NEXT:
* The Department of Water Resources, the state agency that since January has
been buying electricity for the customers of three financially ailing
utilities, is set to release on Friday numbers that will indicate whether
state power regulators will need to order an electric rate increase so the
state can recoup its power buying and administrative costs.
THE PROBLEM:
High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight
supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and
maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California's
electricity crisis.
Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost
nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's
electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E,
saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state
lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and
natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are
refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power
for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The
state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas
& Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and
PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs.
The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37
percent for the heaviest residential customers and 38 percent for commercial
customers, and hikes of up to 49 percent for industrial customers and 15
percent or 20 percent for agricultural customers to help finance the state's
multibillion-dollar power buys.







Energy Secretary to speak at forum on California energy crisis

(07-20) 00:28 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --
U.S. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham spent only a few minutes addressing
California's power woes as he spoke to an audience of business leaders and
city representatives who have seen blackouts roll through their factories and
technology firms.
California's power woes will not be solved with conservation and increased
reliance on renewable energy alone, Abraham told the crowd of local business
leaders in echoing statements from other Bush administration officials.
"If you don't have enough energy supply you face the threat of blackouts,"
Abraham said. He devoted the rest of his speech promoting key aspects of the
Bush administrations energy plan.
The nation needs to expand and improve its electricity transmission system to
make sure power can get where it needs to go, unimpaired by political and
geographical borders, Abraham said.
"It's not just enough to just have an adequate supply. It has to be
reliable," Abraham told the crowd.
Abraham urged the technology industry to focus on developing methods to move
power more efficiently, and added that charging more for power at certain
times of day would trigger more conservation than the government urging the
public to cut back usage.
He praised the efforts of Washington State-based Puget Sound Energy to bill
its ratepayers more if they used electricity during times of highest demand
-- when electricity is most expensive -- to encourage them to conserve or
shift their factory production or laundry to cheaper hours of the day.
Rather than relying solely on distant power plants for electricity, Abraham
hopes homes and businesses will soon run their appliances on power they might
produce in their own backyards and parking lots.
Abraham arrived in San Francisco after telling a crowd of Hispanic community
advocates in Milwaukee that the Bush administration saw partnerships with
neighboring countries, including Mexico, as essential to developing untapped
energy sources.
Abraham's speeches around the country coincide with a House Republican effort
to approve broad-ranging energy legislation before the end of the month when
Congress leaves for its summer recess.
The GOP's energy package would offer billions of dollars in tax breaks and
favors for the coal, oil and nuclear industries as well as conservation
incentives. That plan is similar and in some cases exceeds the energy
blueprint outlined by President Bush two months ago.
The package of legislation includes drilling in an Arctic wildlife refuge;
incentives for technology to allow continued use of coal for power
production; and tax breaks for high-mileage hybrid gas-electric automobiles.
It exceeds the Bush plan in a provision that gives some of the largest, most
profitable oil companies a waiver on having to pay the government royalties
on oil and gas taken from new lease areas in the Gulf of Mexico. Bush opposed
the royalty waiver, which critics claim amounts to a $7.3 million windfall to
the oil companies.
Vice President Dick Cheney is also visiting cities around the country
promoting the Bush energy plan, fearing it is losing steam as gas prices and
other energy costs continue to slide.
Both the Bush plan and the House's energy package have been criticized by
environmental groups as being too soft on expanding energy efficiency and
conservation programs and too easy on extending tax breaks to energy
companies.
Some of the criticisms stem from Cheney's refusal to identify all the
industry leaders who met with the energy task forced chaired by the vice
president which developed the Bush energy policy.

Energy secretary in S.F. to push Bush program
Abraham says supply is the key, not conservation

In San Francisco to stump for President Bush's energy plans, Energy Secretary
Spencer Abraham yesterday praised California's conservation efforts but
insisted that frugality alone would not solve the power crisis.
Abraham, speaking to a group of Bay Area business leaders, warned against the
perception that the crisis is lessening even though rolling blackouts haven't
materialized this summer as expected.
"There's a pervasive myth," he told people at the Bay Area Council's annual
dinner at the San Francisco Hilton on O'Farrell Street. "It's the idea that
we have no real energy crisis, or if we do, it can be overcome with
conservation."
He insisted that California and the rest of the country still need to
increase power production, decrease dependence on foreign oil and fix an
inadequate electricity transmission system -- key elements of the
administration's plan.
"We've not only got to have more supply, it has to be reliable," he said.
Abraham also delivered a pitch aimed straight at some of the technology
companies with representatives at the dinner, saying the government needed
their help to create a radically different power system in decades to come.
He described a future in which superconductors would make energy transmission
more efficient, with electricity flowing easily across the country through a
"transmission superhighway."
The United States would join Canada and Mexico in hemispheric power planning,
and consumers would have their own home generators and sell power back to the
grid. He also suggested that environmentally friendly hydrogen fuel devices
could one day replace much of the need for gas and oil.
"I challenge high-tech to embrace this agenda, to fight for this agenda, and
apply your genius to it," Abraham said.
His address came as the federal government's latest broad energy bill --
including new fuel economy requirements for sport utility vehicles and
subsidies for clean coal technology -- was sent to the House of
Representatives floor. Although the proposal received substantial bipartisan
support in the House Energy and Commerce Committee, many Democrats have
argued that it does not do enough to promote conservation.

THEY SAY nothing is fair in love and war. It isn't. But nor is it fair when
it comes to energy.
In Washington, Vice President Dick Cheney, champion of the drill-and-burn
industry, asks the Navy to foot the electric bills for his mansion.
At the same time, the vice president refuses to disclose the costs incurred
by his energy task force or to reveal the hot shots from the oil and gas
industry who helped shape its final policies.
Closer to home, California residents brace for the aftershocks of the energy
crisis. With the state now locked into secret, long-term and costly energy
contracts, it is the public -- not the energy suppliers who made out like
bandits -- who will be burdened by the billions spent purchasing electricity.
At present, only 39 percent of those surveyed approve of the way Gov. Gray
Davis has handled this crisis. Approval may drop even lower when California
residents absorb the astonishing news that we suddenly enjoy an energy
surplus and that our state is now selling it on a glutted market.
Add to the disgruntled those folks who were already in the habit of shutting
off lights and lowering their thermostats. For them, the mail brought no 20
percent rebate on their electricity bill. It is the watt hogs, who never
lowered the air conditioner and left lights burning all over their homes,
whose paltry efforts netted them the governor's award.
Give the governor credit for keeping the lights on in California. But his
less-than- bold decisions will result in serious political and economic
consequences. Soon, we will have to confront the grave reality that we have
mortgaged many of our dreams ( for expanded health care, improved education
and support for the mentally ill ( for a future burdened by crushing debt.

Wilson says Davis ignored warnings about energy
Former governor defends himself

Former Gov. Pete Wilson, who signed the controversial 1996 energy
deregulation bill into law, blasted his successor Gray Davis yesterday for
failing to aggressively use the governor's most forceful tool -- emergency
powers -- to contain the state's energy crisis.
"There are people who have ignored the supply and tried to blame the crisis
on everyone else," the Republican former governor told nearly 100 academics
and reporters at the Public Policy Institute in San Francisco yesterday.
Arguing that Davis ignored early warnings about brewing problems and "put in
jeopardy parks, schools and other capital needs," Wilson said the Democratic
governor has skillfully engaged in finger-pointing and public relations to
blur perception of the current energy troubles.
"They've sought to blame me, and have done so with some success. . . . And
they've found a much more profitable and exciting target, President Bush,"
said Wilson, who wryly pronounced Bush's recent trip to California as "a
triumph -- for Davis."
But Davis' strategy, he said, "doesn't create one watt of new power."
Wilson's speech -- his toughest public remarks to date on the energy crisis
-- came the day the Public Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank,

32. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly "just a  friend"
have carnal drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling  weird and

Senator Ray Haynes (R) held a press conference this morning to discuss a
report his office produced regarding municipal utility energy charges.
Twelve reporters attended the press conference.  According to Senator
Haynes, none of municipal utilities provided him with documentation or
assistance with his report.  Senator Haynes delivered the report to Senator
Dunn and has requested that he open an investigation into municipal utility
practices.  He also expressed continued disappointment over the Senate's
unwillingness to adopt his legislative amendment which would establish a
windfall profit's tax for municipal utilities.

Senator Haynes referenced Enron several times by comparing Enron's rates to
those rates charged by LADWP and SMUD.

In developing the report, Senator Haynes' office did not analyze peak versus
off peak energy prices, what percentage of power was being sold by municipal
utilities, or, what the cost for producing or procuring power was for the
municipal utilities.  These items were raised by a reporter.  After the
press conference, reporters met privately with SMUD and other municipal
utilities who defended their actions and refuted Senator Haynes' claims.

I was able to obtain one copy of the report and will FedEx it to Karen in
Houston.

As you may know, prior to the start of the last day of the FERC meetings in
Washington DC on Monday, the CalPX submitted to the setttlement judge an in
camera list of the issues that the Committee has been discussing with the
CalPX.  The list did not describe the pending proposals as to how the issues
were to be resolved; it only listed the issues according to the CalPX.

Based upon the list submitted to the settlement judge, I wanted him to know
that the Committee is discussing the issues with the CalPX.  I had a meeting
with the judge and his staff, with the CalPX and its FERC counsel present,
to let the judge know that settlement discussions were underway, but I did
not know whether the Committee would ultimately approve the proposals that
were pending at that point (the July 8 proposal that was sent to the
Committee).  He asked for a copy of the proposal, which I handed his staff,
and he suggested that I describe the proposal to all the sellers in the room
after the California and IOU representative leave.  I told him that I could
not describe the proposal as anything other than a proposal that Powerex
supported and that there were others on the Committee that both supported
and did not support the proposal as it stood at that point.  He told me to
make the presentation and to tell the group that it was not a Committee
proposal at that point because there were both Committee members that
supported and did not support the proposal at that time.  I did indicate,
however, that I was working hard to develop a consenus on the Committee to
support the proposal.

At the judge's request, I made a presentation to all the sellers that were
in the room after the State and IOU representatives left at about 4 pm.  I
did not indicate the names of any Committee members that supported or did
not support the proposal, although I did tell the group that Powerex
supported the proposal.  The lawyer for Mirant told the group that Mirant
was not in support of the proposal at that time.

Lynn Miller from the CalPX and her FERC lawyer were in the room, which was a
good thing as it turned out.  A number of sellers asked whether there was
some way to avoid sending any money to the CalISO without some assurances
that it will be distributed to the appropriate sellers in that market.
Although the CalPX had previously been reluctant to include in the proposal
any language regarding how the CalISO makes distributions, based on the
discussion in the room, CalPX has agreed to escrow amounts payable to the
CalISO, subject to Committee oversight, to ensure that the CalISO directs
that the funds be distributed to the parties entitled to the funds and does
not just turn them over the CDWR or someone else, like the Governor.

Similarly, based on the discussion in the room, the CalPX has agreed to
modify the proposal to provide that any funds that come in the future can
first be used to "true up" the prior distributions back to the beginning
based on the differences in the amounts previously distributed and the
amounts that would be distributed based on a net receivable approach.

There were a few other changes that seemed to make sense, which I have
incorporated into the revised draft attached hereto.  I also attach a
redlined copy to show the changes from the July 8 draft that was circulated
last week.  It appears that the Committee now has more time to discuss and
consider the proposal, although the judge's staff indicated to me that the
FERC would like to receive a proposal that is endorsed by the Committee as
soon as possible because the FERC is anxious to resolve the remaining CalPX
issues.

During my presentation to the seller group at FERC on Monday, a number of
sellers asked for a copy of the proposal.  I was handed about 100 business
cards asking me to send out copies.  At this point, I would prefer to send
out copies only after the Committee has developed a consensus to support the
proposal.  Therefore, I am not sending out copies at this time.  I ask that
all Committee members also not send out copies at this time.

Thank you all for responding to calls on short notice last week.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

met with the Governor's folks and spoke to Loretta Lynch last week to
discuss undercollection strategies, the MOU, and direct access.  He is
not optimistic that any of these issues will be resolved to the
Chamber's satisfaction.  The Gov's folks truly believe that the
successful bond issuance depends upon an end to direct access.  Even if
Bowen gets cooperation on her legislation,  Allan believes she doesn't
really want to do it and is not sure she can get a signature.  I told
him that Burton said he would sign off on a direct access bill if Bowen
agrees to it.  That gave him little encouragement because he doesn't see
much motivation for Bowen to press on the Governor and Angelides.
Allan's view corresponds with everyone we've spoken to whobelieve that
nothing major will happen legislatively.  A subsequent conversation with
Hertzberg's office confirms that they feel unable to move an energy
agenda at this time, although they have not given up.

Recent message from China Jonny:


Howdy! We haven't moved yet to Nanjing, I was just there for work purposes.
Will be moving there in late August (probably August 23-25). It's been
rainy/cloudy here in SE China for the last three days, a wonderful respite
from the furnace like heat of the past six weeks. The countryside from
Shanxi all the way down to Jiangsu province was choked with varying shades
of green. Even Shanxi province has received some rain this summer; this
helps mitigate the effects of a three-year drought they've suffered through
recently.

Had a good 4-day weekend in Taiyuan. We had a big dinner party for Ai Ping's

father on his 65th birthday. This party also served as mini-wedding
reception for us and the Shang family's close friends. Both of Ai Ping's
parents are from Henan province. One of Ai Ping's uncles works for her
brother in the steel business. Essentially, he's a good-hearted,
hardworking, farmer from the Shang family's ancestral home village. Northern

Chinese peasants are world famous for their ability to drink gallons of rice

liquor, and I was witness to a fascinating display of this sort. The uncle
must have consumed about a liter of various alcohols including the local
moonshine, a bottle of Jim Beam that I brought, and lots of Qingdao beer.

He was the king of China for an hour; people were rolling on the floor with
his antics. The wait staff of the restaurant even stopped working to observe

him bouncing off the walls in drunken glee. He drank two large whiskey and
cokes within minutes and stated,"It's just like drinking a cool glass of
water!" to the delight of the revelers. Of course, disaster eventually
struck. He hadn't eaten enough food, and his poor liver couldn't process the

tidal wave of booze. First, his head went bonk onto the table. People ran
for cover expecting the worst. He wretched under the table. Ai Ping's
parents were obviously embarresed, but didn't lose too much face because
everyone was friends or family.

We're hoping to make a trip back to the USA in early October if all goes as
planned. Is this a good time for your guys? China has its National Day
holiday (one week) in the first week of October. We would leave China around

the 29-30th of September and make it a one week trip back to the states. The

Wuxi school is obligated to reimburse me for two, round-trip plane tix. I
need to use them before I lose them. This summer's work schedule didn't
allow me any time off. Let me know if this is a good week for you guys.

Dad, we'll need your assistance in obtaining a tourist visa for Ai Ping. You

and Mom will need to write a "letter of invitation" for Ai Ping explaining
the reason for her travels to the US (ie. an Iowan wedding reception). The
person who invites the Chinese national to the US must also do one of two
things according to the US Embassy's website in Beijing: either provide tax
information from the last 2-3 years OR fill out and sign the I-134 form
which guarantees your economic situation. Unfortunately, you're going to be
involved in some more beaurocratic bliss in order for us to get Ai Ping her
travel visa. My sincere apologies. We've begun collecting documents here on
the China side for the same purpose. I'll do some more net research
concerning this issue, and try to provide you with more info. However,
please start preparing these documents if possible. Once Ai Ping is issued a

tourist visa to the states, travels there, and returns she'll have a much
easier time obtaining the next visa in the future because she'll prove to
the INS that she's not an immigration threat. Thank you for your assistance
in these matters.

That's all for now. Will write again in near future with more info. Hope all

clan members are healthy and in good spirits...

Love,

Jon

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the Chief
Judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that &you
can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink.8  Below is a Cliff
Notes version of the Judge,s report and recommendation issued at 4:49 PM
today.  Attached is the complete work.
The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- &While the amount of
such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, they
do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion
dollars in an aggregate sum.  (At the same time, while there are vast sums
due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by
the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California.  Can a
cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller?  The
Chief Judge thinks not.8  Another notable quote:  &(it is the opinion of the
Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and
cannot be substantiated.8
The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which was
summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate
offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also
rejected.
Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales in
the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge,s
recommendations do not go beyond that date.  "Spot market" sales are "sales
that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior
to delivery."
Evidentiary Hearing- &The differences between what the State of California
believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what
the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise
material issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential
refunds involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a
trial-type, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to
apply to the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an
answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track
schedule.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for
calculating potential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a
methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal
PX's spot markets in an after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event,
sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating
that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein
over the entire refund period.8
Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the
June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to
calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISO's
and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period October
2, 2000 through May 28, 2001.
Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates
(associated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order)
provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.
Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based
upon a daily spot gas price.  &In the event that the marginal unit is located
in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate and
Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the
marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If
the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas
price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by the
marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  The
daily spot gas prices should be for the "midpoint" as published in Financial
Times Energy's "Gas Daily" publication for the aforementioned delivery
points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the
refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and
holidays).8
O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the
calculated market clearing price.
Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the
market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may
subtract from their respective refund calculation.
Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing
price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E and
SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.
Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service
prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the
real-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the
same as set forth in the June 19th Order.
Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge
recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for
calculating refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85%
non-emergency requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that
actual prices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be
recalculated.
Offsets-  &Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a
refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all
charges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding
amounts due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be
offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of
their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period.8
Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless
the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

Brendan & I have been in discussion over the last few days, as he was
concerned that his personal circumstances would prevent him from travelling
out of Brussels for the next 6 months or so (except very occasionally), and
about how this would affect his ability to support the Continental Gas
business as he was hired to do.  Options included :

(1) Brendan going back to the Commission for a year or two and reapproaching
Enron after that period and
(2) keeping him in Brussels for the interim period and redefining the role
to focus less on gas and to pick up other EC related work on ecommerce,
environment, coal, steel etc.

Where Brendan has been involved so far, he has shown valuable knowledge of
and insight into the Commission's working practices.  Following discussion
with Eric, our recommendation is to keep Brendan in a Brussels position in
the interim, rather than risk the possibility that after 1 or 2 years he
never actually appears.  He should be available to transfer to London on a
temporary (and perhaps even permanent) basis in early 2002.  Under these
circumstances, I believe it would make more sense for Brendan to report to
Peter Styles during this interim period.  Peter will open discussion with
Brendan to define what he will be doing.  We'll need to consider separately
how to support the Continental Gas activity, given the hole this creates.

Employees: Power supply held down
By Kevin Yamamura and Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 22, 2001)
Three former San Diego Gas & Electric Co. employees who worked at a Duke
Energy plant said Thursday that the generator destroyed working parts,
withheld power supply or otherwise took actions that they believe drove up
the price of electricity.
State officials said the whistle-blowers' comments at a state Senate hearing
today could provide the most damaging illustration yet that power generators
held down production to inflate prices on the spot market. Gov. Gray Davis
has long alleged that power companies have overcharged the state and
utilities.
Jimmy Olkjer, a former assistant control room operator at Duke's South Bay
plant in San Diego, said in a phone interview that during the state's power
shortages, Duke cut supply. Although Duke, a Charlotte, N.C.-based company,
owned the plant, and it contracted with SDG&E to operate the unit, he said.
"Rather than creating more power, they were creating less," Olkjer said. "I
think there was manipulation of the market."
The California Public Utilities Commission and several state legislative
committees continue to investigate price manipulation allegations, and
Attorney General Bill Lockyer has said he will take witnesses to a grand jury
next month.
The generators have denied they manipulated the market.
"We stand behind our maintenance practices and have done a good job keeping
the power flowing," Duke spokesman Tom Williams told the CBS television
network.
But former mechanic Glenn Johnson said he saw generation units taken "down
for economics."
Ed Edwards, also a mechanic, said he was ordered to destroy 23 pallets of
working parts.
"We were asked, myself and other employees, to disperse of perfectly good
parts that were used to make repairs of systems and components," Edwards
said.
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, chairman of the market-manipulation
committee, said his staff has been looking for employees or others with
intimate knowledge of power plant operation to come forward, and he promised
that others will testify at future hearings.
"It's the first time that we've had evidence from directly within power
plants in California that the ramping up and ramping down of power generation
was a response to price and not to demand," Dunn said.
He said he would reach no conclusions until Duke and other generators testify
next month, but he added that the former employees' testimony raises
suspicions "at first blush."

Consumers cut their own power in protest
By Silvina Martnez
Bee Staff Writer
(Published June 22, 2001)
When the temperature hit 100 degrees at 7 p.m. Thursday, Larry Lynch turned
off the air conditioner, unplugged the refrigerator, pulled out the TV cords
and shut down all other appliances in the house.
Lynch, a 61-year-old newsletter publisher in Sacramento, responded to the
"Roll Your Own Blackout" Thursday and joined thousands throughout the state
to protest energy policies and promote conservation by stopping the use of
energy from 7-10 p.m.
But the data coming off the grid at the California Independent System
Operator didn't show the effort.
During the first hour of the voluntary shut-off, the demand for energy by
PG&E customers in Northern California was almost the same as at the same time
Wednesday, ISO officials said.
Protesters didn't expect significant changes on the grid.
"I feel it will at least send a message that we don't have to depend on it
(energy)," said Jackie Bell, 37, a consultant at the Capitol joining the
conservation drive from her apartment on Fulton Avenue.
"It's just a symbolic act," said Peter Lopez of Sacramento, who decided to
use the evening to meditate. "Maybe I'll just go outside, stare at the stars
and try to spot a few constellations in the night."
It was the longest day of the year, and one of the hottest. But those
determined to advocate conservation didn't mind the sacrifice.
"People are getting focused on the fact that we have power at our end," said
Joan Blades, a spokeswoman for MoveOn, a grass-roots organization in the Bay
Area and one of hundreds of online groups passing along the call for the
voluntary blackout.
An electrical engineer in Oakland started the "Roll Your Own Blackout" idea
when he posted a note in a political chat room in April. Then an artist in
Los Angeles forwarded the e-mail to a number of friends and from there it
quickly spanned the globe.
By Thursday afternoon, more than 12,000 people had signed up at the MoveOn
Web site to join the protest, Blades said.
Many threw blackout parties. In San Francisco, the nonprofit group Global
Exchange gathered hundreds around a big bonfire at Ocean Beach.
At his home in east Sacramento, Lynch did fine without electricity for three
hours. He ate tuna salad for dinner, watered the lawn and when it got dark,
he opened the windows and let some air in.
"We should show that people are willing to shut the power off if the prices
go too high," he said.
ISO has not declared a power emergency since May 31.
"We have seen a consistent conservation on a day-to-day basis, and it's
making the difference between blackouts and no blackouts," ISO spokeswoman
Stephanie McCorkle said.
McCorkle encouraged initiatives like "Roll Your Own Blackout."
"People are conserving," she said. "And we can only support this whole
effort."

Davis consultants had contract with Edison: The disclosures turn up the heat
on the governor for hiring the ex-Clinton aides.
By Emily Bazar
Bee Capitol Bureau
(Published June 22, 2001)
Two consultants hired to advise Gov. Gray Davis on energy policy officially
disclosed their contract with Southern California Edison on Thursday, but
Davis aides insisted it is not a conflict because "Edison and the Governor's
Office have the same goal."
Communications consultants Chris Lehane and Mark Fabiani have drawn intense
criticism since they were hired last month to shape the Democratic governor's
public response to the state energy crisis.
The former Clinton administration communication aides -- nicknamed the
"Masters of Disaster" for their spin on the Whitewater, travel office and
1996 fund-raising controversies at the Clinton White House -- have come under
fire for receiving a six-month, $30,000-a-month contract, more than the
governor or anyone on his staff makes.
Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who is running for governor next
year, has called for an investigation into potential conflicts. State
Controller Kathleen Connell, a Democrat, has said she will not issue
paychecks to the pair pending her own investigation.
The criticism mounted after the duo's economic interest disclosure forms were
released late Thursday, showing that each has received at least $10,000 under
contract from Edison in the past year.
But Davis spokeswoman Hilary McLean defended their credibility, saying
there's no conflict of interest because Lehane and Fabiani both disclosed
that they had worked for Edison before they signed their contracts with the
state.
Besides, she added, Edison and the governor are working toward the same goal:
Both want the Legislature to adopt a memorandum of understanding, a proposed
agreement, that would prevent Edison from going bankrupt by financing a state
purchase of the utility's transmission lines.
"It's not a conflict because there's been full disclosure," McLean said.
"Edison and the Governor's Office have the same goal, passing the MOU. We're
working together at this point with Edison."
But open-government groups and Republican lawmakers bristled at the notion
that disclosure negates any potential conflict.
Derek Cressman of the California Public Interest Research Group pointed to a
section of state law that prohibits public officials from influencing
decisions if it would have "a material financial effect" on a business entity
that provided them $500 or more within the last year.
"You have two individuals on the government payroll who had previously been
on the Edison payroll and it's not clear to whom their loyalties are," he
said. "Just because they've revealed it doesn't mean there's not a conflict
there, and that they're not serving two masters."
On Thursday, Jones said he is awaiting the results of the Fair Political
Practices Commission investigation and agrees with Connell's decision this
week to withhold payment from the consultants.
"This further calls into question the ethics of how these individuals were
hired and contracts were let," Jones said.
Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte believes there's no question that Lehane
and Fabiani are violating conflict-of-interest laws and suggested that the
two should be paid out of Davis' campaign funds, which had reached $26
million by Jan. 1.
Brulte, of Rancho Cucamonga, added that he would not vote for a state budget
as long as Lehane and Fabiani remain on the state payroll.
"The state of California does not need to be paying political wordsmiths
$30,000 a month," he said. "I just wish (Davis) were as frugal with the
taxpayers' money as he is with his campaign money."

State deal may ease blackout threat
Canada to supply energy as summer demand rises

SACRAMENTO -- California may be able to avoid some of the blackouts predicted
for this summer, thanks to a little-known power-swapping agreement with a
Canadian utility.
The arrangement is expected to give California electricity in July and August
from the hydroelectric generators of BC Hydro in British Columbia, despite a
serious drought in the Northwest.
California has sold surplus power in recent months to the government-owned
utility, which is expected to return power to the state as heat drives up the
demand for electricity.
State deal may ease blackout threat
Continuing coverage: California's Power Crisis
Despite the energy crunch, the state often finds itself with surplus power
that can be sold or swapped. For instance, advance power purchases that
provide energy at a better price may deliver more power than needed at any
given time, particularly during off-peak hours.
BC Hydro's reservoirs and hydroelectric generators are a little like an
electricity storage battery. By importing California power, BC Hydro has been
able to conserve water that can be released this summer to produce power for
California.
As a result of the agreement and other factors, state power buyers say they
are in a stronger position going into the hot summer months than they had
expected. So far this week, the state has managed to get through a heat wave
without so much as a Stage 1 power alert.
"We are in much better shape at this point than I imagined we would have been
as little as a month ago," said Ray Hart, head of the power purchasing unit
in the state Department of Water Resources.
The North American Electric Reliability Council, which last month predicted
260 hours of rolling blackouts for California this summer, has noticed a
change in recent weeks.
"We don't seem to have the crisis we were all expecting," said Ellen Vancko,
a council spokeswoman. "But whether that is a short-term or a long-term event
we don't think anyone knows yet."
Much of the credit for avoiding blackouts is given to unexpectedly high
conservation by Californians and an increased supply of power. Many
generators that had been shut down for maintenance or lack of payment are now
back on line.
But the hydroelectric power agreement had gone unnoticed until now.
Hart mentioned it during a Senate Energy Committee hearing this week. But he
declined to reveal the amount of power banked with BC Hydro, saying it could
hurt the state's competitive position in the market.
"If I start talking specifics," said Hart, "then I have to give out what I am
doing every single day, and I have no market position."
In the past, California routinely sent power to a number of utilities in the
Pacific Northwest during the winter when residents there needed heat.
Northwest utilities returned power to California in the summer when air
conditioning drove up demand.
Little was expected from the reciprocal arrangement this year because
California was short of power last winter as electricity prices soared, and
drought has sharply lowered reservoirs in the Northwest. But the agreement
with BC Hydro will provide at least some power this summer.
The state was forced to begin buying power in January after its two largest
utilities, Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric, were
unable to borrow because of a $13 billion debt. The rates that the utilities
could charge their customers were frozen under a failed deregulation plan as
the cost of power on the wholesale market skyrocketed.
Hart said it took time to convince BC Hydro, which has demanded cash for some
electricity, that it could safely do business with California despite big
debts owed to generators for power they supplied to the utilities.
"We have only been able to do it for the last couple of months," said Hart.
"It took a long time to get them to do it because of credit issues."
A spokesman for BC Hydro said the utility engages in power swaps but does not
release the name of the other parties or the terms of the agreements.
"Our first priority is taking care of our own," said Warren Cousins of BC
Hydro. "We are still looking for opportunities to help out other entities
when we can."
Hart said the state has another arrangement with the federal Bonneville Power
Authority, but again refused to provide details. He said the state has sold
surplus power to several buyers, including the Los Angeles Department of
Water and Power.
Information about state power purchases had been closely guarded until
recently. Gov. Gray Davis, pressured by lawsuits and a court ruling, released
edited versions last week of 38 long-term power contracts worth $43 billion.
The Davis administration said it agreed to release contract information
because power prices have dropped, easing competitive pressures.
Ex-worker: Duke manipulated market
By Bill Ainsworth
UNION-TRIBUNE STAFF WRITER
June 22, 2001
SACRAMENTO -- A former operator at Duke Energy's Chula Vista plant said he
was told frequently by company officials during the past year to alter the
plant's output in a way that may have boosted electricity prices.
The operator, Jimmy Olkjer, said he was even ordered to cut power generation
during energy emergencies, when the state faced rolling blackouts because of
a scarce supply of electricity.
He said he believes reducing the electricity generation helped the company
charge higher prices. "It looks like that's what they were doing," Olkjer
said in an interview.
He and another former plant employee said that during the past year the
company regularly operated its least-efficient turbine, possibly to justify
higher prices.
The allegations, which they plan to repeat today at a state Senate hearing
investigating power generators, provide the first insider evidence that Duke
Energy may have manipulated output at its South Bay plant to drive up prices.
Duke, based in North Carolina, leases the South Bay plant from the San Diego
Unified Port District.
A March report by the Independent System Operator, which manages California's
electricity grid, alleged that by withholding power Duke and four other
owners of generating plants have contributed to billions of dollars in
overcharges to California consumers.
Tom Williams, spokesman for Duke Energy North America, said that varying the
output of the generating units at the Chula Vista plant had nothing to do
with trying to achieve higher prices.
He said the changes in output helped balance the state's grid by "dancing in
the market" -- providing flexibility for grid managers by allowing the plant
to add or reduce power quickly.
Williams added that the aging South Bay plant produced as many megawatts last
year as it did in 1994.
Olkjer served as a plant operator for 18 years, mostly when the plant was
owned by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. After Duke took over the plant, workers
were guaranteed their jobs for two years. In April, when that period ended,
Duke laid off Olkjer and other workers. Now he is retired.
During the two years Duke has managed the plant, Olkjer said, operators
frequently got calls from officials with Duke Energy Trading and Marketing in
Salt Lake City telling them to adjust their production schedule.
Some employees at the plant monitored the hourly price of electricity posted
by the Independent System Operator and recognized a correlation, he said.
"We noticed that a lot of times when the price was down (our) megawatts would
go down," he said. "If the price was up, often the megawatts would go up."
Olkjer said he was never told why he was being ordered to turn the plant's
output up and down. When he asked, he said, company officials told him it was
none of his business.
Still, he was puzzled, particularly when he was told to throttle down the
plant during electricity emergency alerts -- as he says he did Jan. 16 when
the state declared a Stage 3 alert, with the possibility of rolling
blackouts.
"It doesn't make sense to cycle up and down when there's a Stage 3 alert," he
said.
Duke spokesman Williams said the company may turn down units at the orders of
the ISO during a Stage 3 alert because the grid manager can find cheaper
power somewhere else.
Lisa Szot, spokeswoman at the ISO, said she couldn't determine whether the
ISO had ordered Duke to power down its Chula Vista plant Jan. 16.
Olkjer said the frequent adjustments of power production, which sometimes
occurred every half-hour, wear out the plant's equipment.
"It's harder on the machinery," he said. "It's like driving down the street
putting your (foot) on the gas and then slamming on the brake."
Before deregulation, Olkjer said, the four units at Chula Vista, which have
the capacity to produce 706 megawatts, had been operated steadily during much
of their history.
S. David Freeman, formerly general manager of Los Angeles' Department of
Water and Power and now chief energy adviser to Gov. Gray Davis, said rapid
cycling had become more common under deregulation and is hard on equipment.
"We had almost 15,000 megawatts of generating capacity down for repair last
winter," said Freeman, referring to what industry experts agreed was an
extraordinary level of plant outages over several months.
SDG&E, which built the Chula Vista plant in the 1960s, sold it to the Port
District for $110 million. In 1998 the port leased the plant to Duke Energy
for 101/2 years in what critics are now calling a sweetheart deal.
The company pays minimal rent, but has made large profits. In the first
quarter of this year, Duke, which owns three other plants in California, said
profits rose 208 percent to $428 million from energy sales and trading.
Duke may hold the record for charging the highest price for electricity. It
asked $3,880 per megawatt-hour this year. By comparison, before the energy
crisis began, electricity sold for around $35 per megawatt-hour, an amount
which powers about 750 homes.
Federal regulators have ordered the company to refund $20 million to the
state for charging excessive prices unless the company can justify them.
In May, the company offered to pay the state to settle any price gouging
investigations, but Gov. Gray Davis declined.
Olkjer and Ed Edwards Jr., who worked at the plant for 20 years before being
laid off in April, said they couldn't understand why Duke ran the
inefficient, high-cost turbine unit during the past year while other
generators sat idle.
They said they believed it may have been an attempt to fetch a higher price
for electricity because the company got extra fees when it ran.
Williams, the Duke spokesman, said the opposite was true. He said Duke ran
the small turbine more frequently because it was less expensive. It ran on
jet fuel, which was cheaper than the natural gas powering the other units.
Edwards said the smaller unit was run so hard that it was destroyed.
"It ran so frequently and so hard, it needed extensive repairs," he said.
Edwards told CBS News last night that plant outages at Chula Vista were
prolonged because one supervisor ordered him to dump spare parts.
The former power plant employees said they felt compelled to come forward
because they saw the impact the power crisis was having on their community.
"It kind of irritated me because you know there's people on a fixed income
that can't afford a big utility bill," said Olkjer.

Estimates of Power Profits Disputed
Electricity: A study of overcharges by suppliers may be flawed, state
officials say. Davis quoted the figures to Congress.
By DOUG SMITH, ROBERT J. LOPEZ and RICH CONNELL, Times Staff Writers
Gov. Gray Davis' contention that California has been nicked for billions
of dollars in inflated electricity costs is based on a study that state
officials concede may have significant flaws, according to interviews and
confidential government documents.
Those costs--estimated by the state to be as high as $9 billion--were
central to Davis' testimony this week before a U.S. Senate committee, where
he again denounced power wholesalers and urged federal regulators to "give us
back the money that was wrongly taken from us."
The governor's impassioned demand, however, was based on shaky
calculations. The formulas are being reworked, said Charles Robinson, vice
president of California's grid operator, which prepared the study.
Robinson said he "had no idea" how much the amount allegedly overcharged
by the generators might change. For now, he said, the agency stands by the
numbers.
But internal documents from the California Independent System Operator
warn that some of the financial assumptions used to quantify the alleged
excess profits could be well off the mark.
What's more, the documents caution against relying on the agency's study
as a basis for allegations of overcharging--as Davis did during his testimony
Wednesday. That warning was particularly important because the documents
provide for the first time a detailed accounting of how much each energy
supplier prospered from the state's power troubles between last summer and
February.
The largest amounts were charged by four out-of-state power companies,
according to the confidential Cal-ISO report. Okalhoma-based Williams Cos.
led the group with $860 million, followed by Duke Energy with $805 million,
Southern Company Energy Marketing (now Mirant) with $754 million and Reliant
Energy Services with $750 million.
When told of the alleged profiteering attributed to them, executives of
the companies insisted the numbers were grossly overstated because of
Cal-ISO's poor methodology.
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said his company's entire energy earnings
for North America were less than the amount it was accused of reaping
unfairly in California.
"It doesn't add up. It doesn't come close to adding up," Williams said.
"What [Cal-ISO] has done is highly irresponsible math."
Paula Hall-Collins, a Williams Cos. spokeswoman, said the firm would
need to study the ISO report further. But generally, she said, such reports
fail to fully account for electricity production costs.
"We maintain that we have not overcharged, and that we have operated
legally."
Reliant spokesman Richard Wheatley also questioned the figures, saying,
"There's a lot of misinformation out of there."
A Mirant spokesman said: "We haven 't overcharged. We haven't
manipulated. We haven't withheld."
Even some firms alleged to have overcharged to a much lesser degree were
outraged.
Joe Ronan, vice president for government and regulatory relations at
Calpine, said the $236 million attributed to his company "doesn't bear any
relation to reality."
"Anybody can throw out any number," he said. "It's like McCarthyism. . .
. Where is the evidence?"
A spokeswoman for Davis conceded that his refund figure was an estimate
but defended it as reasonable.
"It's no surprise that the people that are gouging us want to dispute an
estimate of how much they're gouging us," senior advisor Nancy McFadden said.
Despite the cautions expressed in the Cal-ISO documents, officials
Thursday insisted they were not troubled that the governor referred to the
agency's figures as potential overcharges.
"The way it should be characterized is the amount paid above a
competitive benchmark," said Robinson, who is also Cal-ISO's general counsel.
The first version of the now-disputed Cal-ISO study was made public in
March. It estimated that power sellers earned $6.3 billion in excess profits
between May 2000 and last February. The report, later revised upward to $6.7
billion, became a crucial element of the Davis Administration's campaign
against alleged electricity price gougers.
This week, just before Davis' appearance in Congress, the study was
updated again, adding another $2.2 billions in alleged excess profits through
May.
The orginal study, which did not include actual pricing data, was mostly
intended to prod federal regulators into seeking information from generators
that the state had been denied, Robinson said.
Thus far, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has ordered refunds
of only $125 million. Next week FERC is convening an unusual settlement
conference aimed at addressing the outstanding claims by the state, as well
as those of sellers who claim they are owed hundreds of millions of dollars
by California utilities.
One encouraging signal for state officials came this week when FERC
reiterated an earlier order that Duke Energy pay millions in refunds. The
order stemmed from the company's sale of electricity at $3,880 a megawatt
hour--for thousands of hours.
FERC's order said Duke's pricing had resulted in $11 million in
billings. A fair price for that power would have been $273 per megawatt hour,
the agency said.
Tom Williams, a Duke spokesman, said the firm is willing to accept the
lower price. He said he company has yet to collect a dime.

Edison Plans Bond Offer at 13% Rate
Debt: Yield is about double what a credit-worthy company would pay, analysts
say. But will investors bite?
By JERRY HIRSCH, Times Staff Writer
Edison International is offering investors what analysts are calling an
unprecedented 13% interest rate for $1.2 billion in notes to refinance debt.
Even so, it's far from certain that the Rosemead-based power company will
find enough buyers to complete the deal.
A failure by Edison to refinance $618 million in bank debt that comes
due June 30 and an additional $250 million in notes due in July could put the
company precariously close to bankruptcy and cast a shadow on California's
plan to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to pay for power purchases, said Dan
Scotto, a bond analyst at PNB Paribas in New York.
"Even though it would at first appear to be a company setback, it would
really be a major setback for the state," said Scotto, who added that
Edison's credit troubles could translate into higher prices for California's
proposed bond offering.
Edison, however, said Thursday that the deal is moving forward.
"We believe our deal is going well, and we are comfortable with it,"
said Jo Ann Goddard, vice president for investor relations. She declined to
discuss other details of the offering.
Goldman Sachs Group, Edison's investment bank, expects to formally price
the offering Monday. Edison officials would not comment on the proposed price
of the note offering, but Wall Street sources said the power company was
shopping the issue at the 13% rate.
Edison floated the plan earlier this month as a way to tap the borrowing
power of a profitable subsidiary to trim debt that comes due this year and to
insulate itself from a possible bankruptcy of its ailing utility unit. The
utility, Southern California Edison, has lost billions of dollars on
electricity sales over the last year.
The high interest rate on Edison's proposed sale of seven-year notes is
about double what a credit-worthy company would pay for a similar bond or
note issue and would add a premium amounting to tens of millions of dollars
in annual interest costs to the company's already strapped financial
condition, analysts said. It's a full two percentage points higher than the
average rate for other junk, or speculative, bonds. And corporate bonds with
similar ratings are going out at 9% to 10%.
Edison originally started marketing the issue at 12%, a full two
percentage points higher than what analysts initially expected, but then
raised the rate to 13% in recent days because it was finding few takers on
Wall Street.
"The word is that they couldn't get people interested and that they
might not be able to get it done," said Kurt Stabel, a money manager at
Street Asset Management in Newport Beach.
The higher rate, however, might be pulling investors out of the woodwork
and has increased the chance that Edison will pull off the deal, Scotto said.
"This never promised to be a day at the beach," Scotto said. "I think it
is really a question of find the right price, the price at which people feel
comfortable with the risk."
Both Stabel and Scotto said that Edison's note offering is unusually
complicated and requires far more explaining or "selling" than typical
corporate offerings.
Mission Energy Holding Co., a company created by Edison for the sole
purpose of issuing these bonds, will offer the notes. The assets of Edison
Mission Energy, a subsidiary that owns a network of power plants across the
United States and in Asia, Australia and New Zealand, will secure the debt.
Mission Energy Holding plans to issue the proceeds to Edison in the form
of dividends, giving the parent company funds to pay off a substantial
portion of its debt.
The notes will have a credit rating of BB-minus and come due in 2008,
according to bond rating agency Standard & Poor's. That's slightly higher
than the near-default CC rating now carried by Edison.
If the offering failed, Edison would face a series of difficult choices
that range from depleting its cash cushion to going back to its bankers and
begging for continued forbearance.
Its SCE subsidiary already has defaulted on $931 million in bonds and
notes. That triggered a default in bank lines of credit at Edison
International and SCE, which has since operated under extensions from its
lenders.
Edison has about $3 billion in cash, including $2 billion held by SCE,
according to regulatory documents.
"This could all still unravel, but I have been impressed with [Edison's]
effort to inch along so far," said Ellen Lapson, an analyst at Fitch Inc., a
corporate credit rating service. "Who would have thought that they could have
lasted so many months after their first default in January and still not be
in bankruptcy?"
Positive developments for Edison, including a deal to hold small
generators at bay with partial payments from SCE and progress at crafting a
rescue plan in both the state Legislature and the Public Utilities Commission
have sparked a small rally in the company's stock.
Edison shares have risen 8% this month. They gained 21 cents Thursday to
close at $11.90 on the New York Stock Exchange.
Energy Company Abandons Plans for Baldwin Hills Plant
Power: Homeowners and environmentalists rejoice at decision. The site is
proposed as a 1,200-acre state park.
By JOE MOZINGO, Times Staff Writer
In a victory for environmentalists and nearby homeowners, an energy
company announced Thursday that it was abandoning its plan to build a power
plant on the site of a proposed state park in the Baldwin Hills.
La Jolla Energy Development Inc., in a letter to the state Energy
Commission, said it was withdrawing its application for fast-track approval
of the 53-megawatt plant and "will not pursue the Baldwin facility in the
future."
"We listened to the community," La Jolla President Steve Wilburn said in
an interview Thursday. "We need to find another place for this equipment."
The project was to be a joint venture between La Jolla and Stocker
Resources, an oil company that leases the land where the trailer-sized
natural-gas plant would sit.
Stocker officials said they will decide in the next few days whether
they will pursue the project. "At this point it's just La Jolla pulling out,"
Stocker spokesman Steve Rusch said.
But most observers said it would be difficult to move forward on the
fast-track schedule the state has implemented to relieve the energy crisis.
The state commission was scheduled to decide whether to approve the
project today in Sacramento, but the hearing has been canceled.
The news sparked elation among environmentalists and nearby homeowners
who had fought the proposal on grounds that it would pollute neighborhoods
and threaten an ambitious plan to piece together 1,200 acres of public open
space in the hills.
"We're getting ready to have the biggest party," said Tony Nicholas,
president of the hills' United Homeowners Assn. "This shows how a community
can come together for a common goal and mobilize the people in a matter of
days."
About 76% of the residents in the hills are African American and many
saw the issue as a matter of environmental justice.
In addition, Stocker and La Jolla were seeking approval for the plant
within 21 days of filing their application, under the governor's emergency
power orders. By following this fast-tracked procedure, they would have been
able to avoid the normal, time-consuming environmental review process.
That angered opponents even further, and nearly 1,000 people showed up
at a public hearing Monday to fight the project.
But what officials said turned the tide against the project--at a time
when the energy commission is approving such plants as fast as possible--was
testimony from a South Coast Air Quality Management official who said his
agency would not be able to approve the plant quickly.
Executive Director Barry Wallerstein said his agency would have to
conduct hearings that would take up to 60 days, pushing construction well
beyond a Sept. 30 deadline set by the governor for fast-track projects. He
also said it was unlikely Stocker could get needed exemptions from federal
clean air laws.
In a letter to the Energy Commission this week, Wallerstein wrote: "It
appears that the Baldwin Energy Facility could not begin operation until some
time in the first part of 2002 at the earliest." By Wednesday night, the
energy commissioner who presided over the public hearings issued a statement
recommending that the rest of the commission deny the application for a
plant, citing Wallerstein's concerns.
Conservationists embraced the outcome as a sign that the movement to
create a park was gaining steam. The Baldwin Hills Conservancy was created
last year with the idea of creating green space for the densely populated
neighborhoods of south Los Angeles. With support from the governor and local
politicians, the state recently bought a 68-acre parcel in the area for an
unprecedented $41 million.
"This is a great day for the Baldwin Hills and all the people who have
worked so hard to bring this world-class vision to reality," said Esther
Feldman, president of Community Conservancy International and the main
organizer to build the park.
Also applauding La Jolla's decision were state Sen. Kevin Murray
(D-Culver City) and Assemblyman Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who had come out
strongly against the project. They and others questioned whether the small
amount of power provided by the facility--coming online after the dog days of
summer--would do much to relieve the energy crisis.
"I'm ecstatic" Wesson said. "At this point the environment has won."
The plant would have sat on what is a working oil field about 650 feet
from the Kenneth Hahn State Recreation Area. And according to park
proponents, it would lie in the middle of the grander state conservancy, on
what would be a half-mile bridge of land arching over La Cienega Boulevard.
Rusch, the spokesman for Stocker, said much of the information
circulating about the trailer-sized plant is false.
The plan did not call for "a stack with billowing smoke," he said. "If
the issue is air quality, we've cleaned air quality up." In the last decade,
Rusch said, the company's existing 400 oil pumps on the property have reduced
nitrogen oxide emissions from 374 tons to 3 tons a year. The power
plant--with two 70-foot stacks--would ultimately add about 18 tons a year.
He said the company was trying to cut its energy bills by providing its
own power to pump oil, while also contributing an extra 39 megawatts to the
state grid during the energy crisis.
Residents say there are more desolate places for the state to relieve
the energy problem. Said Mary Ann Green, president of the Blair Hills
Homeowners Assn.: "We just hope that Stocker would be responsive to the
outcry from the community."
Western states could feel pinch from California pricing

(06-22) 02:45 PDT SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --
When power supplies stretch thin across the West this summer, who will decide
whether Silicon Valley computers, Washington apple orchards or Las Vegas
casinos get first dibs on what's left?
It's a key question raised by the decision of federal energy regulators this
week to cap electricity prices throughout the West, using a formula based on
California's power costs.
Economists, energy industry executives and officials in all 11 states are
beginning to analyze the fit of this new piece in the energy puzzle.
Though most call the order a good step that could prevent price gouging,
others worry the pricing system could lead to electricity shortages for
California's neighbors, or prompt utilities to stock up on power contracts to
fend off shortages. That could diminish any leverage power buyers might have
as they compete for the remaining megawatts available each day.
Tying the highest possible power price to California could cause a problem
come winter, when power demand drops in the Golden State, said Gary Ackerman,
director of the Western Power Trading Forum, which represents most sellers of
energy.
States where consumers need electricity to heat furnaces through the winter
would be unable to outbid each other above the price cap, which is usually
determined by a formula based on the highest bid for last-minute power during
the most recent energy supply emergency in California.
That may leave power wholesalers, and not a free market, to decide who gets
the energy.
"Certainly, California has a tremendous pull on our prices and has for
probably the last year," said Claudia Rapkoch, spokeswoman for Montana Power
Co., which supplies natural gas and electricity to two-thirds of the Big Sky
state. "What it means for this winter, we're just going to have to wait and
see."
California utilities had much more control over power supplies before
deregulation in 1996 obligated them to sell off their power plants to
encourage competition. This brought lower prices for a time, but gave control
over power supplies to wholesalers that aren't obligated by state law to
serve the serve the best interests of local customers.
Rather than appointing one power grid manager to decide how to divide power
in the West, Ackerman predicts utilities in non-deregulated states will
simply sell their power within their borders. That would hurt California,
which this week imported about 10 percent of its electricity and its
remaining supply from local plants owned by out-of-state power companies.
Price cap or not, utilities in the region will watch out for each other as
best they can, because they might need the favor returned, said Charles
Reinhold, executive consultant for Electric Resources Strategies in Ariz.
Saddled with rising bills that threatened to exhaust the state's budget,
California recently began to sign long-term contracts with generators. Gov.
Gray Davis credits the change for helping to drastically reduce prices on the
spot market, which earlier this month fell below $50 per megawatt hour for
the first time in a year.
The long-term contracts, though, weren't cheap. California will pay an
average of $70 per megawatt hour during the next decade under 38 different
contracts signed so far.

Feds spurn Duke Energy in its bid to avoid refunds

Federal regulators have rejected attempts by Duke Energy Inc. to avoid
refunding millions of dollars to California for charging exorbitant
electricity prices in January and February.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission first ordered the refunds on March
9, and Duke responded by filing a challenge. But the commission on Monday
rejected the company's appeal and reiterated its earlier order, claiming Duke
had abused its power in the California energy market when it sold power for
$3, 880 per megawatt hour.
"We will not tolerate abuse of market power or anticompetitive bidding or
behavior," the commission said.
Duke acknowledged this month that it had charged $3,880 per megawatt for
about 5,500 megawatt hours sold to the state's major utilities in January and
February, netting it more than $19 million in receivables.
The commission did not specify how much money Duke should refund, but it
directed the company to readjust its January billings for those hours to a
price of $273. From a FERC document, it appears that about 2,835 hours
occurred in January, which would result in a total refund for that month of
$10.2 million.
Duke is one of the companies that have been identified by both the California
Independent System Operator, the manager of the state's electricity grid, and
the FERC as having exercised market power and overcharged Californians for
electricity.
Meanwhile, employees at the South Bay power plant in San Diego run by Duke
are expected to testify in a state Senate committee hearing today that the
company ramped production up and down. That allegedly was aimed at lowering
power production during shortages and attempting to drive up electricity
prices on the spot market.
The workers were employed by San Diego Gas & Electric Co. but were working
under contract to Duke.

Washington -- There was a reason Gov. Gray Davis donned a dark blue jacket
and endured beastly humid 90-degree heat this week in an area behind the
Capitol known as the "House swamp."
The nation was watching. And after months of political free fall, his message
seemed to be taking hold.
"California has been bilked out of $9 billion while the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission was asleep at the switch," Davis declared, repeating
testimony he had delivered hours earlier in the air-conditioned confines of a
Senate hearing room.
Wiping a bead of sweat from his brow as 10 television cameras and two dozen
reporters recorded the scene, the California governor apparently couldn't
resist taking another shot: "For nearly a year I've been pounding on this
commission to enforce the law."
The state's energy crisis, with its volatile spot markets, out-of-state
generators and dearth of alternative energy providers, is a dizzyingly
complex policy puzzle. The politics are much simpler.
Democrats present themselves as consumer crusaders, defending helpless
utility customers from greedy energy conglomerates and misguided regulators.
Republicans portray themselves as stewards of the free market and long-term
solutions, rejecting price caps and refunds as heavy-handed overreactions
with Soviet-style results.
The Democratic populism seems to be winning the battle. Though the debate is
far from settled, the consumer-oriented approach to California's energy woes
has raised their hopes of winning back the House of Representatives in 2002
and the White House in 2004.
"Republicans are scared out of their minds about this," said one gleeful
Democrat on Capitol Hill, who suggested that the White House's lackadaisical
response to California's problems would rile consumers from coast to coast.
"This could rival Pete Wilson's alienation of Latinos," said the Democrat,
referring to the former Republican governor's strident stand against illegal
immigrants, which many blame for the party's weak standing in California.
A sign of the GOP's concern surfaced this week with television ads, financed
by anonymous sources but produced by Republican Party strategists, that blame
the Democratic governor for California's energy problems.
Democrats, who long have worried that the crisis could cost Davis a second
term, now take credit for having pressured the White House and federal
regulators to take a more active role.
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which had previously resisted such
efforts, took steps toward controlling wholesale electricity prices Monday.
Later in the week, two commissioners appointed by President Bush testified
that they might be open to further price restrictions and support huge
refunds to California. And just yesterday, Vice President Dick Cheney, who
has been among California's most vocal critics, told Senate Democrats behind
closed doors that he could support refunds to California if federal
regulators agreed, according to those in the meeting.
"There is no doubt in my mind that action (taken by federal regulators) was
the direct result of pressure for price relief led primarily by the
California delegation," Davis said.
The pressure did not come only from Democrats. Republican lawmakers, some of
whom fear the crisis could cost them seats in 2002, wrote FERC last week,
requesting commissioners to "take further actions" to help the state.
The Democrats' public relations success follows an effort by the party to
raise the profile of its consumer crusade. Hardly a day has passed in the
past several weeks without a group of Democrats holding a news conference to
attack the White House, the Republican controlled House or FERC for inaction.
But it may have just as much to do with a White House that has been far more
focused on long-term energy production than the immediate concerns of
Californians. Even as it engaged in a legitimate policy dispute over how to
solve the power mess, the Bush administration appeared indifferent to the
plight of residents experiencing skyrocketing energy bills and rolling
blackouts.
Bush tried to correct that impression with a trip to the state last month.
But the damage appears to have extended beyond California.
A CBS News/New York Times poll released this week of 1,050 adults from across
the country showed that only one in three voters approved of the job Bush was
doing on energy. More than half the respondents said that protecting the
environment was a higher priority than producing energy, yet barely one in 10
said that Bush shared that priority.
Some Republicans say that Bush was in a no-win position, contending that
anything he did would have been attacked by California's opportunistic
governor.
"Politics is (Davis') main objective, and I don't see the Bush administration
being that way," said Rep. George Radanovich, R-Fresno.
The question for some analysts is whether Democrats might have been too
successful. By pressuring the federal government to take a more active role,
Democrats may lose their ability to point the finger at a convenient
scapegoat.
"Davis has always needed rate caps much less than he needed a scapegoat. Now
that FERC has given him what he wants, or close enough to it, it's a lot
harder for him to lay blame back on Washington when the blackouts kick in,"
said Dan Schnur, a GOP analyst based in San Francisco.

Suit filed over report on power lines, health
Deal on transmission grid could raise liability

N114037.DTL&type=news
As state legislators consider Gov. Gray Davis' deal to buy part of the power
grid in California, a public records advocacy group filed a lawsuit yesterday
demanding that the state release a report on potential health hazards of
living near high-voltage transmission lines.
The document could be vital to how legislators vote on the $2.76 billion deal
to buy Southern California Edison's power lines, said Terry Francke, general
counsel for the California First Amendment Coalition, which filed the lawsuit
in Alameda County Superior Court. The power line deal was brokered by the
governor to help the cash-strapped utility.
Legislators must approve the power grid purchase by Aug. 15 or the utility
can back out. Davis also has a $1 billion agreement to purchase San Diego Gas
and Electric's power grid, which also would require the Legislature's
approval.
Pacific Gas and Electric has not agreed to sell its transmission lines.
The power lines report was completed in April by California Electric and
Magnetic Fields Program, an agency set up by the state Department of Health
Services to study the issue, Francke said. Both state agencies and their
directors are named in the lawsuit.
Efforts to keep the report secret are suspect, Francke said.
"If it's known there's some danger . . . do you want the state owning that
liability?" he asked.
The study began in 1993 after the state Public Utilities Commission committed
$7.2 million for research and education on the subject, Francke said.
The state document deals with scientific findings on how magnetic and
electric fields from transmission lines affect humans and possible policies
based on those findings, he said.
The report was scheduled to be released to the public on May 7, but "at the
last minute, the Public Utilities Commission apparently instructed the staff
of the EMF Program to keep the reports secret," the lawsuit said.
State health services spokeswoman Lea Brooks said that the report was only a
draft and that her department was following orders from the PUC.
"The PUC wanted to see the draft before (it is released)," she said. "We
prepared (the report) for them. We are following their request."
Brooks refused comment on the lawsuit, saying her office hadn't seen it. PUC
officials were not available for comment.
Studies on the effects of magnetic fields have resulted in no clear consensus
on their effects, Francke said. That's what makes the state study important
for legislators to consider before voting on the governor's deal to buy
transmission lines, he said.
Opponents of the power grid deals say the report may add to objections to
Davis' agreements with the utilities. Some legislators would rather the state
help build more power generators in California.
"They are extra nails in the coffin," said James Fisfis, spokesman for state
Assembly minority leader Dave Cox, R-Fair Oaks. "We have fundamental issues
with the transmission lines, but when you start stacking these items up,
you have an undigestible deal."
Davis' spokesman Roger Salazar said he believed the governor hadn't seen the
health hazard report.
"Obviously, if something pops up and is an issue, you'll take a look at it,
but I don't think we're at that point yet," he said.
An Alameda County Superior Court judge will hear the lawsuit on July 23,
Francke said.

Texas power firm's shares falling
Power baron Enron finds fortunes fading

U178338.DTL&type=news
There's trouble in Texas.
Enron Corp., the Houston power firm that's profited mightily during
California's energy crisis, is suffering a surprising lack of popularity on
Wall Street.
While all eyes have been on Enron's enormous profits here and its enormous
pull in Washington, D.C., the reputed titan of the newly incarnated, free-
wheeling power industry has lost half its market capitalization -- more than
$30 billion -- since its peak in August.
Forgive Californians for savoring a bit of schadenfreude over the Houston
boys' reversal of fortunes. But what gives? Isn't this the company that was
fattening up on the backs of the state's beleaguered utilities, residents and
state budget? Isn't this the company with such close ties to the Bush
administration that Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, was reported to have
interviewed a candidate for a job on the commission that regulates his
company?
Yup. That Enron.
On Monday, Enron shares hit a 52-week low of $43.07, after the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission decided to apply the same price controls to power
marketers such as Enron that had applied to power-generating companies for
months. That's a far cry from August, when the company's shares peaked at
$90.
"There's a whole kaleidoscope of issues that Enron is being challenged with
in the marketplace right now, none of which on the surface is a major deal,"
said Donato J. Eassey, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Global Securities in
Houston. "But when you combine them all . . . I think what's happening here
is you have a crescendo with this FERC announcement. You have people saying,
'OK, the growth rate is now in question.' "
That growth rate was an eye-popping 88.82 percent in revenues for the United
States on a two-year average, and nearly 98 percent in the rest of the world.
Enron officials did not respond to a request for interviews, but as the stock
continued to drop Tuesday morning, chief executive Jeff Skilling issued a
statement to the markets in which he reiterated "strong confidence" in its
earnings guidance. The stock rebounded slightly throughout the week, closing
at $44.05 yesterday.
In a speech at the Commonwealth Club last night, Skilling blamed regulatory
interference with the "free market" for investor flight from his company.
"Our stock prices have gotten hammered," he said. "They're half what they
were a year ago."
Tumbling stock prices weren't the only bad news for Skilling last night. A
protester pelted the executive with a berry pie just before he began
speaking. As Skilling used paper towels to wipe the pie from his face, a
woman was arrested on battery and malicious mischief charges.
Enron isn't the only company with stock prices that soared in tandem with
California's power crisis and are now suddenly headed south. Shares of
Reliant Energy Inc., AES Inc. and Williams Companies Inc., which generate and
sell electricity in California, and El Paso Energy Corp., which sells natural
gas here, are all trading near 52-week lows.
The main culprit appears to be the suddenly serious talk in Washington about
power price controls, re-regulation and now, the possibility of big refunds
being ordered for California. Even Calpine Corp. of San Jose, which has
developed a reputation as an industry good guy because it has not played the
spot market and has not been accused of manipulative tactics, dropped nearly
7 percent yesterday, to $37.10. But none of the companies has been hit as
hard as Enron.
Such a drastic drop in market capitalization poses serious problems for any
company. It leaves it less money to invest in its own growth, and because
executive compensation is so closely tied to stock price, a sharp decline
makes it more difficult to retain talented leaders.
While Enron's power wholesaling division seems to be doing fine, the firm has
been buffeted by disappointments in other lines of business and other regions
in recent months. In the financial press, the continuing knock on Enron is
that its business lines are so new and complex, and the company is so
secretive about its operations, that analysts and fund managers don't feel
confident in their understanding of what it does.
A look at the firm's recent troubles exemplifies its diversity.
For instance, Enron has engaged in repeated battles with the state government
of Maharashtra in India over a 2,184-megawatt power plant there. The Dahbol
Power Co., which is 65 percent controlled by Enron, stopped construction on a
second phase of the project on Sunday, claiming it is owed $48 million by the
Maharashtra State Electricity Board. The state has accused Enron of charging
too much and not generating enough, and stopped buying power from the plant
last month.
Closer to home, Enron has struggled with its investments in fiber-optic
bandwidth. The company buys and sells unused, high-speed bandwidth space,
treating it like a commodity as it does electricity, coal or natural gas. But
the fiber-optic sector has imploded in recent weeks as it has become clear
that for all the long-distance cable laid in the ground, there have not been
enough "last mile" connections set up for users to actually take advantage of
it. Earlier this year, Enron scuttled plans for a joint venture with
Blockbuster to offer what it called "video on demand," in which customers at
home would be able to select a video of their choice for a fee and have it
transmitted via fiber-optic cables.
Then there was the FERC ruling. For months, the agency had resisted
aggressive price controls in the West, preferring to let the market run its
course. But as control of the U.S. Senate was handed to Democrats this month
and President Bush appointed a tough Texan regulator named Patrick Wood III
to the commission, the agency changed its tune. It expanded price controls to
all hours of the day, spread the controls throughout the Western region and
brought previously excluded power marketers under the tent.
So under current calculations, that means Enron could sell power for no more
than $108 per megawatt in a shortage and about $90 during normal hours -- far
short of the hundreds of dollars that companies were regularly charging
during the past year.
In part, the company's gyrating stock price reflects the volatile nature of
the businesses Enron has decided to pursue. And the hard-charging company has
a reputation for going aggressively into entirely new markets. But sometimes
that approach gets it in trouble, as was the case last year, when Enron had
to take a $400 million charge for its failed investment in Azurix, a global
water company that set out to make a commodity out of water supply the same
way it had done for electricity service, as governments privatized their
water systems. The opportunities never materialized.
Add it all together and Enron has a tough time supporting a price-earnings
ratio of nearly 39, considerably above the liberal standard of health, which
is 25. The company had less than $1 billion in profits on more than $100
billion in revenues last year. Still, a survey by Thomson Financial/First
Call found that analysts expect Enron to deliver earnings of 42 cents per
share in the second quarter (up from 34 cents last year), and $1.79 per share
on the year. Most maintain a strong "buy" rating on the stock.
But investors with big positions in Enron have taken a hit. Hardest-put of
them will be the Janus funds, which, as Enron's largest mutual fund investor,
held nearly $3.33 billion of its stock as of the end of April.
In a semiannual report to investors, John Schreiber, a portfolio manager,
said the stock price of the "new-age energy merchant" was a victim of
negative psychology resulting from the California energy crisis. Janus
declined to make fund managers available for interviews.
"There are tremendous rewards for being first into new markets," said Raymond
Niles, an energy analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. "When you're
an aggressive first-mover, from time to time you're going to make mistakes.
But I don't think any of the mistakes Enron has made hit the core of the
company."

Power firm accused of price-fixing
Former employees say Duke Energy slowed production of electricity to create
an artificial shortage, boost profits
BY DION NISSENBAUM
Mercury News Sacramento Bureau
SACRAMENTO -- One of the largest companies producing power in California
ordered workers to throw out spare parts and shut down equipment in an effort
to drive up the price of electricity, former power plant workers said
Thursday.
Speaking out on the eve of appearances at a state Senate hearing, the three
men offered the strongest evidence yet that at least one power producer --
Duke Energy -- sought to make more money by creating an artificial shortage
that may have created huge electricity price spikes.
``Their intent, in my opinion, was to boost the price up,'' said Glenn
Johnson, a mechanic who worked for two decades at the Chula Vista power plant
now run by Duke. ``If I've got the only box of penicillin in town and you're
sick, I can charge a million dollars a box,'' he said. ``If you want to live,
you're going to have to pay.''
Officials at Duke angrily challenged the accusations, calling them
irresponsible charges by disgruntled workers who were let go in April.
``Their allegations are just comical, just highly erroneous,'' said Tom
Williams, a spokesman for Duke, which runs four plants in California that
produce enough energy for nearly 2.6 million homes.
The charges come as the state heads into negotiations next week with
generators over the $8.9 billion the state claims its consumers have been
overcharged. Duke, based in Charlotte, N.C., came under considerable
criticism when it disclosed that it charged the state a record $3,880 a
megawatt-hour for power in January. Federal officials have called the charge
unreasonable and ordered Duke to refund California the money.
The employees, who first made their allegations public on ``CBS Evening
News'' Thursday night, will be the only witnesses today at an energy crisis
hearing headed by lawmakers who suspect that power companies have been
illegally gouging California.
State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Garden Grove, chairman of a committee investigating
price gouging, said the allegations raise serious concerns. ``While we still
need to hear the other side of the story from Duke, if there's any truth to
the information, I believe it would be devastating to the generators,'' he
said.
`Perfectly good parts'
In interviews with the Mercury News Thursday night, the three former plant
workers said that they were directed to scale back energy production and
throw out good spare parts that kept the plant from getting up to full power
for weeks.
Ed Edwards, who worked in the Southern California plant, said that he was
told to get rid of many boxes of good spare parts. Edwards said he tossed
more than 23 pallets of parts into a dumpster.
``I don't know why they were throwing away perfectly good parts,'' he said.
``It didn't make sense.''
Johnson said the lack of on-site parts prevented workers from quickly fixing

She turned, smiled and said, "Business.  I'm going to the annual

He swallowed hard.  Here was the most gorgeous woman he had ever seen

Struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, "What's your

"Lecturer," she responded.  "I use my experience to debunk some of the

"Really, what myths are those?" he asked.

"Well," she explained, "one popular myth is that African American men

The woman started to feel a little uncomfortable and blushed.  "I'm

Here is an update on Oakhill power sourcing:

Wholesale Generation + Ancillaries
Electric cooperatives and municipalities are exempt from retail deregulation.  We can not directly contract with AEP or whoever the wholesale generation provider would be because it constitutes a retail sale in a non-deregulated area.  The prevailing utility in the area must be the buyer of the power.
Generation + ancillaries will be provided by the chosen entity, through NTEC, and then through Rusk.  The wholesale generation + ancillaries contract will be a three party agreement between AEP (or whoever is chosen), NTEC, and Rusk.
Swing - There are consumption penalties for using more or less than the contracted 5.0 MW 7x24 block (meaning there is no free swing).  These penalties are part of the ancillary services, which means that we will not have the exact specifications until Rusk receives the bids on their RFP on 6/27/01.

T&D
T&D is provided directly by Rusk County Electric Co-Op.
NTEC is charging us $0.20 / MW as an administrative fee (mark up), which is why the fixed T&D cost from Rusk County is $10.20/MW and not $10.00/MW.
There will be a minimum T&D charge from Rusk, above which we pay for only what we use:
o	For example:  We pay the minimum charge or actual usage, whichever is higher.

Ricki is constructing the T&D only contract (which he claims will be similar in structure to the previous contract), with the inclusion of T&D pricing and swing.  I also reminded him that he needs to provide the audited financial statements to us.  Attached is a deal diagram with the most current information that we have.  Please let me know if you have any questions.

I spoke with Chuck Shoneman and Randy Rich (another partner at Bracewell also working on the case) yesterday regarding their estimate of time and cost to prepare a memo responding to the questions in the presentation.  Upon further reflection, Chuck thinks that, in order for the law firm to provide a useful and informative document, the memo must be pipeline specific.  He thinks that he can prepare the memo within the time frame discussed (aiming for end of July 4 week but no later than mid-July), for about $30,000 (plus costs, estimated to be about $5,000).  However, in order to meet this time frame, they will need some upfront information.  Specifically:

1.	Based on the three pipelines we discussed, they would like to get the FERC case docket numbers where FERC 	issued certificates for the particular storage facilities being considered.  Because these pipelines have many 	storage fields, it will save a lot of time and money to have these docket numbers up front.   The pipelines should 	have this information available.  If we cannot narrow down the facilities that we're looking at, the law firm's 		response memo will not be as useful and they may not be able to meet our timing requests.

2.	Additionally, the law firm would like to have all of the settlements and side agreements that the pipelines have	entered into with its customers regarding the storage facilities at issue.  The law firm's analysis will be impacted 	by these agreements, and obtaining the settlements from public records would be time consuming and costly, 	and side agreements are not publicly filed.

In order to access this information, it will be most efficient if our regulatory people meet with the pipelines' regulatory people to obtain the exact information that we need for the analysis.  Please let us know if this is doable.

One last point, Chuck asked if we would know by Monday whether we want to engage the firm for the work.  I told him we won't know before Wednesday, and he said that is fine, but the longer we wait to engage the firm, the further we push the date out for when the firm will get us a final product.  Just something to keep in mind.

Also, Donna's computer is broken and she cannot send emails, so she asked me to send this message about her follow up discussion with Henry May:  Henry May estimates that his firm can do the work for approximately $30,000.  However, he is making no promises about the result, and Donna got the impression that, even after we spend $30,000 for his analysis, his end result may be that we cannot do the deal.  Henry did mention, however, that a partner of his worked on a financing deal for Enron regarding Bamel Storage.  Robert Neustadter is looking into that transaction further.

Thanks

Sarah

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
State Budget Discussions Deteriorating -Bonds Issuance Jeopardized
PG&E Bankruptcy Advisor Comments on SoCal

Budget & Bond Concerns
Sources report that discussions within the state's budget conference committee have completely disintegrated.  Although last Tuesday's tentative $2.7B reserve agreement between the parties offered some hope to  the situation, Republicans have since completely broken with Democrats and are begging for a number nearly half of the previously agreed amount.  The legislative recess is scheduled to begin July 20th, and prior to the Davis administration, the legislature very rarely took month-long recesses due to the budget battle (there usually was a Democrat-controlled legislature and a Republican governor).  Sources report that if legislators take leave without a budget resolution, it would most likely compromise their ability to pass the budget and MOU, before the MOU's deadline of Aug. 15th.

Sources also indicate that delays in establishing the state's budget could prompt Wall Street investors to once again downgrade California credit rating.  A lowered rating could complicate the $12B bond issuance the state expects to offer in late September 2001 by forcing the state to offer a higher rate of return, which could mean fewer bonds.  Sources recently conducted a private interview with parties close to David Wiggs, head of the LA Department of Water & Power, (DWP is in constant contact with both SoCal and PG&E and is a creditor of both utilities and the DWR. -- Wiggs is close to and in constant contact with Governor Davis, Hertzberg and Burton, and he knows every other state official relevant to energy issues).  Wiggs' position on the bonds and SoCal follows:
The state is "really worried" about the bond issuance.  The state believes it can sell $3B in bonds now, but as for $11 - $12B, they are "not confident."  The state is currently trying to put its revenue streams in place, then it will have to prep Wall Street regarding the revenue streams.
Wiggs saw Treasurer Angelides Wednesday (6/20) and told him that, "I wouldn't buy these bonds."  Wiggs stated that, "There is not a clear enough path for those rates."
Wiggs was Hertzberg's advisor on energy.  He was also at El Paso (energy company, not gas company) during its bankruptcy.  Wiggs commented that he is worried because he lives in SoCal territory rather than DWR territory.
Both Wiggs and his DWR staff believe that an MOU/Plan B deal will not pass.  They are not thinking in terms of counting votes, but rather of the very large number of things that need to be done simultaneously in order to make a solution work.

PGE Advisor on SoCal
Sources recently interview the attorney who is currently acting as bankruptcy advisor to PG&E, and may be the potential advisor to SoCal in bankruptcy proceedings.  Comment follow:
The attorney believes that the likelihood of a SoCal voluntary filing is 60 to 70%, but he does not know when it will happen.  The attorney would not speculate as to the likelihood of an involuntary filing, stating that he did not know.
Concern was expressed that if a solution were passed to make SoCal liquid again, DWR (under instructions from the state) would then refuse to purchase the net short, leaving SoCal with a huge bill for power that it could not pay.  SoCal would then be faced with borrowing money to pay for the bill (an unlikely event, given their current status) or declaring bankruptcy.  The attorney commented that DWR had already tried to send power bills to PG&E in bankruptcy; Montali refused to force PG&E to pay them.  The attorney therefore believes that DWR is likely to force SoCal (and PG&E if it were made solvent) to resume paying for power as soon as possible.  The attorney believes that SoCal is aware of this problem and that it must be taken into account as part of a bailout solution.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Rick,

Thanks.  I understand that the ESD is an annual simulated emergency depressurization of the ETS compressor station on the lean and rich lines upstream of the Bushton Plant.  By operating the ESD valve, all the gas piping in the plant yard can be blown to atmosphere by Northern.  If that is done, the Bushton Plant obviously goes down and loses the ability to service its customers for a period of time.

You advised that in ESD simulations conducted in years past, we did not require the compressor to be fully blow down; we performed it in such a way that no depressurization at all was required, so the Bushton Plant was not out of service at all during the ESD simulations.  This year, however, someone in Northern's compliance section (maybe Pat Long's group) has required that the ESD simulation be conducted in such a way that partial depressurization of the yard piping will be necessary.  Northern has figured out a way to do this such that the flow of gas to the Bushton Plant will be uninterrupted, with some small pressure changes.

The ESD would normally last 15-30 minutes; however, Northern would also like to take the opportunity to perform needed work on the Northern generators located
at the ETS compressor station as well.  This will extend the simulation period to about two hours.  During this time, Northern's measurement equipment (the meters, the chromatograph, and the two Fisher Rocs) will be on battery backup.  You mentioned that the big power hog would be the gas chromatograph.

My gut is that we don't want to take any unnecessary chance that our back-up batteries would fail and leave us in a position where we had to rely on Plant PTR. Accordingly, my suggestions is that we should immediately investigate renting a Honda generator or some other back-up power source, and call Jim Bowen of Instromet for his input.  Please remember that although Jim was our expert in the arbitration, you don't want to just forward our internal memos and correspondence to him without checking with me first.

I await the input of others.

(Parenthetically, for the time being, I am asking that everyone put "Northern v. ONEOK" in the Subject line of internal e-mails regarding gas measurement at the Bushton Plant, given that we still have a lawsuit pending.  This applies whether or not the e-mail includes someone in Legal.)

Britt

Please plan on providing your own lunch on October 20.  We will provide drinks, but you should bring water for yourself.

I have ordered tee shirts. If you want one, please advise me of your size, small through extra large, in writing or e-mail.  The price is $8.00, which will just cover our cost.  The shirts are gray with the Habitat bent nail logo on the back and the St. Paul's logo on the front.  I will have them at the site.

We will have hard hats at the site.  If you are scheduled to work and have indicated that you have power tools, please confirm to me that you will be able to bring those tools on your scheduled days.

Noel Chang has volunteered to be the transportation coordinator.  He will provide or arrange transportation on a church van or bus on each of the Saturdays.  I have given him your name if you identified yourself to me.  You can contact him at "changing@swbell.net" or 281-461-4709.

We need volunteers for several other key positions.  If you are qualified to be a first aid/safety manager, or would like to organize food/water/beverage, daily registration, clean up or tool management, please let me know.

For additional information, contact me at: 713-748-3317; fax 713-741-6233; or email: lesliewmadams@aol.com.

Hi Beth,

At the same time, our lawyers in Houston have circulated a copy of the confirmation yesterday. Principally, they are the same that we circulated earlier, except that some of the defined terms in their confirm is more aligned to the Master Energy Swap Agreement. For e.g. Determination Period, Trading Day, etc.. I am attaching a copy of their draft for your perusal.

Could you kindly have a look at this latest draft and discuss any possible changes to this, including the legal changes you required in yesterday's draft, with our lawyers Mary Cook (713 345 7732) or Sara Shackleton (713 853 5620) directly.

We are hoping to get the actual dates, barrels etc. soon.

He would be taxed by the Mexican tax authority, not US.  Tim Callahan will set him up with a PWC tax consultant we utilize in Mexico to help him with his taxes in Mexico, but he would not fall under the tax equalization program like an expat.

Californians oppose Edison deal, poll finds

By Amy Chance
Bee Political Editor
(Published Sept. 25, 2001)

Californians by large margins oppose Gov. Gray Davis' proposal to use state-backed bonds to prevent Southern California Edison from slipping into bankruptcy, according to a Field Poll released Monday.

Overall, the new poll found that Californians' concern about the electricity shortage has eased considerably. They give themselves credit for proving power blackout predictions wrong with strong conservation efforts.

But they are in no mood as taxpayers or ratepayers to help bolster the finances of a key investor-owned utility.

The poll noted that Edison "is in danger of declaring bankruptcy" and asked those surveyed whether "to avoid this possibility" they supported a proposal in which Edison would issue $2.9 billion in state-backed bonds to be repaid by its customers over time.

Adults statewide opposed the idea 66 percent to 23 percent; registered voters were against it 68 percent to 21 percent.

Pollster Mark DiCamillo noted that a large majority of Southern California Edison's own customers -- 70 percent -- were opposed to the plan.

One factor, he said, may be the public's view of bankruptcy.

"With PG&E in bankruptcy, nothing has really changed for PG&E customers," he said. "That may have some influence on their attitudes."

The Democratic governor has sought for months to gain legislative support for a plan to prevent Edison from following Pacific Gas and Electric Co. into bankruptcy court, arguing that the state's ability to get out of the power-buying business depends on the effort.

But the Legislature adjourned Sept. 15 without taking final action on a plan. Consumer groups argued vigorously against what they termed a "bailout," and some lawmakers said they didn't see the proposal as a better alternative than bankruptcy.

Davis threatened to call lawmakers back to the Capitol to address the issue within two weeks, angering Senate President Pro Tem John Burton. Both the governor and Burton have since said they intend to negotiate before asking legislators to return.

DiCamillo said the numbers indicate that Davis is pursuing an unpopular path that could affect his own re-election effort.

"If he continues to pursue it -- and all indications are that he's going to -- he's expending more of his own political capital on an issue that is clearly not very popular," DiCamillo said. "He may wish to do that. Some people say that's how you define leadership -- when you take your own personal stances because you think they are in the public interest, (not) what people think at the time.

"But some of the medicine he's prescribing is unpalatable. And some of the Democrats in the Legislature have called him on it and said, 'We're not going to go for this. We're running for re-election, too.' "

A Davis adviser said the findings were "no surprise."

"Utilities aren't popular. That's the reality," said Davis political consultant Garry South.

In May, amid predictions that the state would spend the summer suffering through blackouts, 75 percent of Californians saw the situation as "very serious." That number dropped in the latest poll to 44 percent.

Asked to rate the efforts of various groups and officials to improve California's energy outlook, residential energy consumers put themselves at the top of the list, with 55 percent saying they have done a very good or good job.

Californians also saw industry and business as willing to pitch in, as 40 percent described their efforts as good or very good.

They gave higher "poor" marks, meanwhile, to a long list of others -- Davis, the Legislature, President Bush, the state Public Utilities Commission, the state's private utilities, out-of-state energy providers and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

And about half said they continue to see rate increases that hit earlier this year as "very" or "somewhat" serious, and expect rates in their area to rise even more in the next 12 months.

"If you asked them to rate how they got out of this situation, they'd say we got ourselves out of it by cutting back -- the politicians didn't help much, the regulatory agencies didn't help much," DiCamillo said. "But they're still irritated because rates have gone up, and they expect them to go up further.




Daniel Weintraub: Now it's illegal to purchase your own electricity




(Published Sept. 25, 2001)

Buying your own has been banned in California. Electricity on the open market is now officially contraband. Like prescription drugs, which you can get only from a licensed pharmacy, electricity is something you can buy from your local utility, which can make its own or buy it from the state. Beyond that, it's an illegal substance.

It was the grand hope of a deregulated electricity industry that you and I and the factory down the street would be able to buy our own juice from the lowest bidder. It might have been a pain -- kind of like shopping for telephone service. But just as breaking up Ma Bell spawned great leaps in mobile phone technology, busting the utility monopoly was supposed to usher in a new era for electricity.

Not that there were mobs of shopkeepers and apartment dwellers lobbying the Legislature for consumer choice. It was the biggest users who really wanted to cut their own deals. Under the old, regulated system, the huge factories that make steel and cement and computers, and gobble up electricity by the megawatt, were paying 50 percent more than their competitors in other states. They wanted the right to shop around.

The Legislature agreed, but only to a point. Lawmakers permitted choice, but they rigged the new system in its early years to favor the utilities that were a powerful force in the Capitol. They made it nearly impossible for the private generators to undercut the utilities' pricing, and they put roadblocks in the way of cities that might have gathered their small customers together and used their market clout to negotiate for lower rates.

The government spent millions on an advertising campaign trying to persuade us of the wisdom of buying our own energy. But there weren't really many deals to be had. Now there are none.

Consumer choice died a quiet death last week at the hands of the Public Utility Commission. Its demise was collateral damage from the mess that was California's experiment in electricity deregulation.

Choice couldn't survive because the state, which now controls the energy business, can't cope with the competition. If Californians were allowed to buy their own electricity, pretty soon most of us would figure out that we are getting a rotten deal from the state. As more people left the state system, the few that remained would have to pay higher and higher rates to keep the books balanced. Eventually, the whole thing would collapse of its own weight.

We're in this fix because Gov. Gray Davis, when he stepped in to buy electricity on behalf of the failing utilities in January, went too far. Craving stability at any price, Davis bought almost all the energy the state will need for the next few years and much of what we'll need for a decade. And he bought that electricity at the top of the market, paying prices that had never been so high, and might never be again.

As those prices were passed along to consumers, suddenly choosing your own electricity supplier got more attractive than ever. Thousands of businesses jumped at the opportunity. Among them were the big steel factories in the Inland Empire region east of Los Angeles.

Tamco Steel of Rancho Cucamonga, which makes rebar, realized its annual electricity bill was going to climb from $12 million to $26 million if it stayed with the local utility, Southern California Edison, according to a report in the Riverside Press-Enterprise. The company, which just laid off 70 people, one-fourth of its workers, desperately started searching for cheaper energy. It signed a deal with a private supplier on Sept. 1, just days before the state slammed the door shut on such opportunities.

That's a scenario that was repeated up and down the state all summer, and it illustrates why, in the twisted world of electricity regulation, the Public Utilities Commission had to step in and just say no. Without the ban there would have been a "jailbreak," in the words of one commissioner, leaving small customers or the taxpayers holding the bag.

That decision might have been unavoidable, given the circumstances. But it didn't have to be this way. Davis could have swallowed hard and ridden out the storm earlier this year. He could have signed electricity contracts for shorter terms at higher prices. That would have been painful, financially and politically, but once the crisis passed, Californians would have been free again to set their own course. Instead, we are imprisoned in a high-priced, state-run system, and will be for years to come.

California, in fact, is worse off than it was in 1995, when companies stuck with high utility rates first asked for the freedom to buy their own electricity. This does not seem like an unreasonable request, an act that should be against the law. Yet now it is. The real crime, though, is the state bungling that destroyed the electricity industry.

Daylight For Gray Davis


By David S. Broder

Wednesday, September 5, 2001; Page A19


SACRAMENTO -- The lights are dimmed in the office of California Gov. Gray Davis, but his prospects of winning reelection next year and becoming a 2004 Democratic presidential possibility are looking a lot brighter than they were just a few months ago.

The office air-conditioning is imperceptible, despite the outside temperature of 105 degrees, as Davis practices the energy conservation he has been preaching. But overall, the summer has been mild, electric power usage is down 12 percent from last year and there hasn't been a blackout anywhere in the state since May 8.

Republicans, who had set up a Web site to record the expected energy crisis, concede that Davis has dodged a disaster. Always cautious, the governor says, "So far, so good, but you never talk about a possible no-hitter in the middle of the game."

In fact, Davis is not home free. He is pushing a financial bailout bill to avert bankruptcy for Southern California Edison, a bill opposed by both free-market Republicans and liberal Democrats in the legislature. Sale of bonds to replace the billions the state spent buying power last winter and spring has been held up by litigation from already bankrupt Pacific Gas and Electric, leaving a potential hole in the current-year budget and ensuring that the election-year fiscal situation likely will be grim. Drought conditions threaten a water shortage next year.

Private polls show clear vulnerabilities for Davis. Despite a drop in public fears of an energy crisis and some increasing optimism about the overall direction of the state, two August surveys I was shown found fewer than one-third of Californians favor reelecting Davis, while two-thirds say he should definitely be replaced or they would consider an alternative. His job approval scores are as poor as those of President Bush, who lost California in a landslide last November.

The polls show a notable Davis weakness among Democrats, and one veteran lobbyist here told me that the governor was "just one blackout away from drawing a serious primary opponent" -- one reason that Davis last week preemptively staged a show of support from the Democratic mayors of seven big cities.

But the potential vulnerability may never be tested. Davis has $30 million in the bank and is headed for a $50 million war chest. California has not denied a sitting governor a second term since 1942, reelecting two Democrats and four Republicans, most recently Pete Wilson, who was in much worse shape politically in 1993 than Davis is now.

And all three potential Republican gubernatorial candidates have liabilities. Wealthy businessman William Simon Jr., son of the former Treasury secretary, has impressed Republican insiders as personable and smart. But he has never run for office before and is unknown to the voters, who have showed skepticism about first-time millionaire candidates in both parties.

Secretary of State Bill Jones, the only Republican in statewide office, has been Davis's most aggressive and effective critic, zeroing in on conflicts of interest in the stock holdings of several Davis energy advisers and appointees. But Jones left the Bush campaign early in the battle for the 2000 nomination to endorse Sen. John McCain, and the White House reportedly has told GOP contributors not to help him. Two McCain allies, Sens. Fred Thompson and Chuck Hagel, are coming out to raise money for Jones next month, but his treasury is anemic.

The White House favorite is former Los Angeles mayor Richard Riordan, who won two races in that heavily Democratic city. Riordan is 71 and, as Davis points out, has never run statewide or in a partisan contest. Conservatives question his liberal social policy positions, and Jones notes pointedly, "Riordan and his wife have contributed more than $1.5 million against Republican candidates, including $80,000 to Gray Davis in past races."

With its growing population of minorities, California looks even to business lobbyists more and more like a solidly Democratic state, where Republican victories will be the exception. GOP leaders in the legislature and the congressional delegation appeared last week to be ready to accept redistricting plans that would save their current seats but lock them into minority status for the next decade.

Bush, who was once seen by California GOP leaders as their salvation, now seems to some of them to have turned his back on the state. He has visited only once since taking office, and one GOP official told me, "The only Cabinet member we ever see out here is [former Californian] Ann Veneman," the secretary of agriculture.

It is a complete reversal of fortune for the home base of Earl Warren, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and Gray Davis is the lucky beneficiary of this historic shift.

Rick Simpson from the Speaker's office, said there will be no amendments to the bill prior to its passing the Assembly.  They are still scrambling for votes and sent the Chamber and WSPA lobbyists out to shore up a few while I was in the office.  I talked to Mike Kahl, WSPA lobbyist, whose firm also represents the restaurant assn.  He argued that the 24th was in the bill for awhile and he called all of their clients to tell them to sign up by the 24th.  He said Enron should have done the same.  I argued that Enron did the best it could, but that negotiations with many entities take varying amounts of time.  So long as the date is past, and customers still have to pay exit fees, what was the relevant policy debate.  There can't be a gold rush now.  Scott pointed out to me that bothWendy's and Burger King
probably belong to the restaurant assn., so our suggestion is that those entities contact Jot Condie at the assn to instruct his lobbyists to change the date to Sept. 1st.  This is time sensitive.  The Chamber lobbyist would love to see a Sept. 1 date, but was not optimistic that they could move the Governor's office.
Rick agreed to ask the Speaker to call Jeff Brown and ask for a delay until the Legislature has time to act.  He will say the bill is expected to pass his House tomorrow and changes will occur in the Senate which will give them direction.  Rick also expressed pessimism that Bowen's attempts at legislation will have a fruitful result.  I have been unable to speak to Burton directly about calling Brown, but hope to see him before the day is over.
Also I have a call in to Mayor Willie Brown, but so far I haven't heard back.
Jim, re the list of customers signing after July 1 - which ones would be affected by the Aug. 24th date?

Just went to make sure that Christine was in Personic so that we could schedule her to come in.  She applied on her own to us through our website on 10/1/01.  According to the emails I have received, Lee Allbritton submitted her resume on 10/9/01.  Under normal circumstances, we (Enron) would already "own" this candidate, and we would not be willing to pay any fee to the agency.

How would you like us to handle this?  I would be more than happy to call Lee and explain if that's the route you choose.  I didn't know what kind of relationship you had with him, or if you even wanted to mention this to him.

I'll wait to hear from either or both of you before we move forward with contacting either the candidate or Lee.

Molly



Lisa:  Let's hold off on scheduling her until we receive a response on this question.

Thanks,
Molly

Gents
I spoke to Ted Brennan, staffer for Cong. Ballenger, about the meeting the Congressman had with Pres Chavez.  Brennan stated that Ballenger raised a number of requests from his constituents over the course of the meeting which Chavez either acknowledged without really responding or said he would look into.  The Jose project I understand was not raised directly with the President though it was raised with the AmCham and other parties in the government that the Congressman spoke to.
Brennan commented that the President was preoccupied with the petroleum sector and views oil production as the key to helping the poor.  The President was not inclined, apparently, in this meeting,  to discuss diversification in investment so it was hard for the Congressman to engage him in a discussion about projects outside of the oil sector.  A refinery project was discussed as well as several other oil related projects.  But Brennan's view is that the President does not see as much value in investment outside of the petroleum sector as he does in additional investment in the sector.  Brennan also commented that there is real concern about possible nationalisation of projects in the oil sector.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Three blondes died in an accident trying to jump the Grand Canyon. They
are
at the pearly gates of Heaven. St. Peter tells them that they can enter
the
gates only if they can answer one simple religious question.

The question posed by St. Peter is - "What is Easter"?

The first blonde replies, "Oh, that's easy! It's the holiday in November
when we all get together, eat turkey and are thankful."

"Wrong!, you are not welcome here, I'm afraid. You must go to the other
place!" replies St. Peter. Then he turns to the second blonde, and asks
her
the same question - "What is Easter?"

The second blonde replies, "Easter is the holiday in December when we put
up a nice tree, exchange presents, and celebrate the birth of Jesus."

St. Peter looks at the second blonde, bangs his head on the pearly Gates
in disgust and tells her she's wrong and will have to join her friend in
the other place; she is not welcome in Heaven.

He then peers over his glasses at the third blonde and asks, "Do YOU know
what Easter is?"

The third blonde smiles confidently and looks St. Peter in the eyes, "I
know what Easter is."

"Oh?" says St. Peter, incredulously.

"Easter is the Christian holiday that coincides with the Jewish
celebration
of Passover. Jesus and his disciples were eating at the last supper and
Jesus was later deceived and turned over to the Romans by one  of his
disciples. The Romans took him to be crucified and he was stabbed in the
side, made to wear a crown of thorns, and was hung on a cross with  nails
through his hands and feet. He was buried in a nearby cave which was
sealed
off by a large boulder."

St. Peter smiles broadly with delight.

Then the third blonde continues ... "Every year the boulder is moved aside
so that Jesus can come out and, if he sees his shadow, there will be six
more weeks of winter!

I just returned from a meeting and had a voice mail from Marc Manly (NPW General Counsel) indicating they had a good meeting with Gene Lockhart this morning and were in the process of turning the document around.  The voice mail was left at 11:35 am this morning.  Marc indicated he would try to E-Mail the documents (blacklined to show changes) to us in approximately 1 hour and suggested that after we skim the documents we get on a short conference call with him so he could walk us through NPW's thought process on why they made the changes (and not to negotiate the document on this call).  Marc indicated, for example, that they changed the daily requirement for reporting in Section 2(b) because from a practical perspective NPW could not meet this schedule.  He also indicated that much of their review had been focused on making sure from a practical perspective the documents worked.

There are two open Republican seats on the CFTC.  The White House is interviewing prospective candidates.  The leading candidates are:  Walt Luken, Professional Staff Member on the Senate Agriculture Minority Staff; Ryan Weston, Professional Staff on the House Agriculture Majority Staff; and Sharon Brown-Hruska, an economist with the Mercatur Center and friend of Wendy Gramm's.

I have been asked by Walt Luken to be a reference for his candidacy.  Walt was instrumental in the CFMA, especially on the energy/metals exemption and is a pro-market supporter.  Linda and I know Walt well and believe he would be a good candidate.  Lisa has met with Walt.  We know his philosophical background and he is a friend of Enron.  I would like to be able to help him by being a reference.

Ryan Weston is also a friend of Enron and is pro-market.  His somewhat less experienced that Walt, but would be a good choice as well..

We do not know much about Sharon Brown-Hruska expect she worked at the CFTC from 1990-1995 and holds a PhD in Finance.  Steve and Rick - Could you find out if we have made a commitment to Wendy Gramm on Brown-Hruska.

An ideal combination for the CFTC, would be to have Walt and/or Ryan.  However, there is some consensus that a Commissioner with a strong financial background would be beneficial.

Please advise.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Today was the first day of FERC's "RTO Week" in Washington, D.C.  The topic of today's panel was "RTO Markets and Design:  Required Markets and Optional Markets."  The issues from both panels were quickly merged and the two panels discussed all of the issues.
All commissioners were present.  Shelton Cannon was the moderator and facilitator.  Purpose is to have intensive discussion to develop FERC guidance.  Focus is on functions rather than characteristics - what should and should not be standardized?
Midwest Commissioners' Presentation
Several Midwest commissioners were invited to make an opening statement.  David Svanda, Michigan PSC, made the comments.  He said Midwest state regulators believe there are arbitrary boundaries between ARTO and MISO.  State regulators worked hard on the settlement that includes single rate and IRCA.  MISO and ARTO have not resolved critical issues and now there needs significant bolstering of the IRAC effort.  Would like to work with FERC on details of Midwest issues.  They propose to create a Joint Board between FERC and State Regulators, pursuant to section 209 of the FPA, to formalize a FERC/midwest partnership.
Panel One:  Mandatory RTO Markets
The morning panel consisted of the following participants:  Peter Cramton (University of Maryland), David Hadley (Indiana PSC), Mark Kleinginna (Ormet), John Meyer (Reliant), John O'Neal (Mirant), and Roy Shanker (consultant for generators in the Northeast).
Energy Spot Market
There was unanimous agreement among these panelists that the RTO must run a real time energy, or spot, market.  Most panelists agreed that the spot market should be a bid-based, security-constrained system with economic dispatch.  In response to a question from Pat Wood, most also agreed that nodal (LMP) pricing should be used in the spot market, although John Meyer from Reliant stated that zonal pricing is used in ERCOT and that works also.
Day Ahead Market and Balanced Versus Unbalanced Schedules
Most of the panelists said that the RTO should not require balanced schedules.  Peter Cramton said that with a day-ahead market, no need for balanced schedules because the real time market prices will discipline behavior.  John Meyer agrees, saying if there is no balanced schedules requirement, then there might be a need for a day-ahead market.  John notes that ERCOT has a balanced schedule requirement.  John also said that imbalance penalties could be appropriate for imbalances that hurt the system.   Roy Shanker also said FERC needs either a balanced schedules requirement (which he does not recommend) or have a day-ahead market.
ICAP Requirement
Although this was an issue to be discussed by the second panel, the issue was raised in the first panel when the discussion centered on ancillary services.  Most of the panelists (except Peter Cramton) support an ICAP requirement.  However, none of the panelists could point to an effective ICAP market (Roy Shanker says he has an idea of what would work - we will probably see this in comments in the ICAP proceeding due later this week).
Mark from Ormet kept bringing the message back to the need to know the rules and know that the rules will not change substantially over time.  Mark said liquidity in PJM does not help him move power to the Midwest since the rules are undefined outside of PJM.  He cannot enter into long-term contracts because he does not know what the rules will be one or more years out.  He also said you can have an ICAP market but market participants have to be able to meet ICAP requirements through load response.
Standardized Markets
Most of the panelists agreed that the mandatory markets should be real time and day-ahead energy markets, spinning and non-spinning reserves and regulation should also be required and be standardized.
Massey asked if the costs to standardize are outweighed by the benefits.  Roy Shanker said the Northeast works so FERC should not change it.  Even if FERC does not require standardization between the RTOs, creating large RTOs and fixing the problems within the RTOs will be a big improvement.  Mark with Ormet and the Indiana Commissioner both urged FERC to standardize the mandatory markets among the RTOs.
Breathitt asked whether there could be an entirely bilateral market with no mandatory balancing market.  All of the panelists agreed that you must have a real time energy market even with bilateral contracts.
Panel Two:  Optional RTO Markets
The afternoon panel consisted of the following participants:  Fiona Woolfe (lawyer with experience in England and Wales pool); Roy Thilly (Wisconsin Public Power Inc.); Richard Pierce (professor at George Washington); Glen Arthur (Connecticut PSC); Steve Naumann (Commonwealth Edison); Ed Cazalet (APX).
This panel was intended to cover optional market issues, including whether a day-ahead market is needed and whether there should be ICAP markets.  This panel addressed these issues as well as the need for a real time market, market monitoring, and other issues.
Mandatory Markets
Other than Ed Cazalet, the other panelists for the most part agree that the RTO should run a real time and day-ahead energy market, ancillary services markets, and there must be an ICAP requirement.  Ed Cazalet believes that there only needs to be a small balancing market (perhaps with balanced schedules requirements) and leave the creation of any other markets to independent entities to create.
ICAP
Most of the panelists believe that the RTO should provide a day-ahead market, congestion management and ancillary services.  Most also favor an ICAP requirement and market.
Pat Wood said he is not convinced that a blanket ICAP requirement is needed on Day One.  He has been considering an ICAP requirement that does not apply until triggers are reached, and perhaps that should be considered here as well.  He has also been talking with a Northeast regulator about having different requirements for states depending on whether they have retail access or not.
Brownell said she thinks the ICAP debate is one that needs to be resolved now, before RTOs are put in place.  She wonders whether ICAP requirements are needed in the interim until RTOs, with working markets, are up and running.  Not many of the panelists agreed with this, saying temporary ICAP requirements will not send the needed signals to build.
Shelton Cannon (Staff) asked the panelists to assume one Midwest RTO - can there be different ICAP requirements within the RTO?
Steve Naumann said he assumes two Midwest RTOs, but most panelists agree that if the ICAP rules are the same within the RTO, that there could be percentage requirement deviations.
Midwest Commissioners' Proposal to Have a Joint Board
Massey asked all the panelists what they thought of this idea.  None of the panelists, even the Connecticut commissioner, thought this was a good idea, citing the inevitable disagreements and problems that will arise, and the risk that such a Board could slow down progress.
Day Two of RTO Week focuses on Congestion Management in the morning and Transmission Planning and Expansion in the afternoon.  We will get summaries out on these panels tomorrow.
Please call me with questions or comments.

Rick and Greg:
Wanda has done a good job of capturing some of the points that she, Beth Apollo and I discussed recently.
Rick, as you and I discussed in our meeting on August 9, we have spent many months documenting discrepancies between source systems (ERMS, Enpower, etc.) and RisktRAC, and the implications for V@R calculations and Credit Aggregation.  The process of a daily meeting and a tracking tool for discrepancies helped to identify true operational process issues that have been addressed.  As we discussed, our daily tracking has now for months documented evidence pointing to the true underlying issue-- that the linkage of information between source systems and RisktRAC is not smooth and reliable, and has never been appropriately addressed for its completeness, accuracy and efficiency.  I applaud the IT team who delivered the analytical tools that are valuable in RisktRAC.  Now it is time to align business rules employed across source systems, V@R calculations and CreditAg and to partner the IT resources from source systems and RisktRAC to solve the underlying problem.
In my meeting with Rick Buy, I volunteered to take ownership of fixing the problem, obviously with much help from the operations teams, IT resources and Rick's designated RAC stakeholder, Debbie Brackett.  Our focus on this project is global, and will be threefold, assuring that agreements on business rules and changes in processes or systems  will deliver ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS and EFFICIENCY.  Wanda's summary seems to allude to a daily reconciliation process that will take place,  To clarify, our purpose in this project will be to create systematic checks, control totals and exception reporting so that humans do not have to implement a daily reconciliation process.
Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the 60 to 90 day timeline.  We do not have a firm timeline established yet.  We have designated business and IT resources, and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved.  We have had a preliminary meeting with Steve  Stock and he is on board and understands that we must make meaningful progress in a short period of time.  With the exception of London, Steve has the necessary IT resources reporting to him for both RisktRAC and source systems.  Steve is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group, and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next 10 days.  We do anticipate a relatively short timeframe for results on this effort, but that is not yet defined.

Rick and Greg:
Wanda has done a good job of capturing some of the points that she, Beth Apollo and I discussed recently.
Rick, as you and I discussed in our meeting on August 9, we have spent many months documenting discrepancies between source systems (ERMS, Enpower, etc.) and RisktRAC, and the implications for V@R calculations and Credit Aggregation.  The process of a daily meeting and a tracking tool for discrepancies helped to identify true operational process issues that have been addressed.  As we discussed, our daily tracking has now for months documented evidence pointing to the true underlying issue-- that the linkage of information between source systems and RisktRAC is not smooth and reliable, and has never been appropriately addressed for its completeness, accuracy and efficiency.  I applaud the IT team who delivered the analytical tools that are valuable in RisktRAC.  Now it is time to align business rules employed across source systems, V@R calculations and CreditAg and to partner the IT resources from source systems and RisktRAC to solve the underlying problem.
In my meeting with Rick Buy, I volunteered to take ownership of fixing the problem, obviously with much help from the operations teams, IT resources and Rick's designated RAC stakeholder, Debbie Brackett.  Our focus on this project is global, and will be threefold, assuring that agreements on business rules and changes in processes or systems  will deliver ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS and EFFICIENCY.  Wanda's summary seems to allude to a daily reconciliation process that will take place,  To clarify, our purpose in this project will be to create systematic checks, control totals and exception reporting so that humans do not have to implement a daily reconciliation process.
Wanda is a little ahead of herself with the 60 to 90 day timeline.  We do not have a firm timeline established yet.  We have designated business and IT resources, and are in the process of discussing with London how they will be involved.  We have had a preliminary meeting with Steve  Stock and he is on board and understands that we must make meaningful progress in a short period of time.  With the exception of London, Steve has the necessary IT resources reporting to him for both RisktRAC and source systems.  Steve is reviewing some diagnostics from his architecture group, and then we will be at the point of delineating milestones and timelines within the next 10 days.

You will recall from our discussions that Enron, as a result of being
charged with infringement of the Odom patent, has a duty to obtain competent
advice from a competent lawyer, that its products do not infringe upon any
valid claim of the Odom patent. The failure to obtain such an opinion
subjects Enron to the added risk of up to treble damages and attorneys fees,
if Enron is held to have wilfully infringed the patent. In essence, the
opinion serves as a fairly dependable form of insurance to a holding of
wilful infringement, and the enhanced damages which are normally attendant
thereto.

Pete Peterson is available to address these issues in an opinion. His firm
(Cox and Smith) has done some transaction work for Enron. I am trying to
learn the amount of work that has been done.  Assuming the work is minimal
such that he appears to not have his testimony influenced by his firm's
relationship with Enron, I suggest that we proceed with Pete.  It will take
him a couple days to digest the material we have already furnished to him.
As soon as we get a complete understanding of Enron's technology, Peterson
will need to be provide clear information as to what Enron is doing to
perform an infringement analysis. If we are unable to find that information
in documentary form, then it will probably be necessary for Peterson to
spend some time with at least one Enron technical person in order for him to
learn about the accused product.

Hey Paul----I did get together with Barry Tycholiz this afternoon when I was in Houston to review the matrix that we have on price risk management initiatives and current practice at the state PUCs in the west.  As you know, the matrix is a starting point, and I encouraged Barry to take a stronger look at his opportunities in each state and that we would do further spade work in those states as he identifies his prospects.  We talked about 3 states that he has initial interest in--- California (Barry is already talking to Dasovich and I will touch base with Jeff tomorrow to follow up), Colorado and Nevada.

I will be reviewing the proposed rulemaking in Colorado in the next few days and will send Barry and Mark Whitt an outline of what the issues boil down to so that we can have a discussion on how active/what strategy we might want us to pursue at the PUC.  As you will recall, we have the opportunity to submit comments until the end of October. While the appetite for taking sustantive action on PRM in at the Commision is limited (only the Chair has a strong interest--his other two commissioners are skeptical and the primary staff person has been quite negative), Barry is not adverse to considering a long shot position.

Although we didn't get into alot of detail on Nevada, Barry is in discussions with Sierra on gas supply and I indicated that you had past experience and ongoing relationships with both the Nevada commission and Sierra and could be a great resource for him.  Could you please give him a call (#713-853-1587) when you get a chance.  Thanks!

I think you're in meetings most of the day tomorrow, but if you get a chance, catch up with me. I am back in Minnesota.

This is the equipment for the proposed interconnect. The Enron "e"nternet is down at this time and I will e-mail your the Engineering Standards when it is running. Jim Williams will be here this PM and I will give him a typical I/C package drawing and Material list set that you can review. This is a typical set and for your proposed I/C, a few modifications to package would be required but it is 80% of what is used at most I/C.

You can develop a cost estimate from this package with your modifications.

Susie Lewis in Exxon-Mobil's Public Affairs Department called me today
for an update on The Center's capital campaign.

Terry Koonce has just passed on to her The Center's funds solicitation
packet for consideration and Susie wanted to know how corporations,
other than Enron, are responding to The Center's request.

I indicated to her that the follow-up calling was just beginning and
that as soon as I could give her an update, I would.  I tried to get
information from her regarding Exxon-Mobil's take on the request.  She
hesitated a bit.  I said that the request was for an effort of the
business community that was unprecedented in the history of Houston.
She agreed and said that Exxon-Mobil has two guiding factors in funding
any effort:  1) the potential for impact on E-M business 2) the
philanthropic value.  She went on to indicate that attracting workforce
to the Houston region was a key necessity of E-M.  She also agreed that
unless this region had a plan, it would be left behind.  She was upbeat,
asked intelligent questions and appeared genuinely interested in and
enthusiastic about The Center's efforts.  She has asked that I call her
back next week.

In addition, Dennis Winkler, Manager, Community Relations - Houston for
Shell (and Partnership liaison for Steve Miller) approached me at the
Partnership's board meeting on Tuesday to chat about The Center.  He
mentioned the fact that Steve Miller had asked him to go to Shell's
Foundation and put Center for Houston's Future in line to receive
funding.  Note:  Dennis did this prior to our solicitation packet being
mailed.

I asked Dennis if Steve had received The Center's solicitation packet
and if so, had Dennis heard any comment.  He said that he didn't know,
but asked for a copy of the packet.  This was sent to him.  I am setting
up a lunch with Dennis next week at his request to talk about The
Center.

Please let me know how to proceed. At this point, I have not received
the final list of your calling preferences.  If I can fill-in or
customize the list for you to facilitate your follow-up telephone
calling effort, please let me know.  I would be more than glad to help.
Thank you for all of your help.

As an update to many of you, I have been on the phone with Roger Kohn of EPA
Region 9 a couple of different times today.  It turns out that what they
really were expecting to see was something more like a formal Biological
Assessment (BA) for CS 3 and CS 4, not a biological survey report like we
provided.  According to the Endangered Species Act (ESA), the lead Federal
agency in a Federal Action is responsible for preparing the BA, but a BA is
typically only required when the action "may affect" a listed species, which
is not the case here.  EPA Region 9, and based on our experience across the
country, apparently only Region 9, is interpreting their responsibilities
under the ESA very strictly and somewhat "oddly."  Regardless, the bottom
line is that it appears we could argue with them ad nauseum and still end up
right back here.  So, we have begun working very quickly and diligently to
put together a "BA-like" document that, according to Roger, will give them
what they need to put in their files to cover themselves for satisfying the
ESA.

I told him that the USFWS typically (under "normal" circumstances) receives
a BA from the lead federal agency and then issues their Biological Opinion
(BO).  I asked him if they (EPA) were going to still feel like they needed
any kind of concurrence from the USFWS.  He said that only if we were going
to have any findings of "may affect" would they maybe feel the need to get
additional concurrence from the USFWS.  I told him that you (Larry) already
have a verbal concurrence from USFWS that there are no issues, in addition
to the fact that our surveys confirmed that.  I told him that our "BA-like"
document is going to come to the same conclusions that our Survey Report did
(i.e., No Effect).  He said that he understands, and will likely just
receive the document, assure himself that it says what it needs to say, and
is formatted in the manner he feels it needs to be formatted, put it in his
files, and put out the Public Notice for a 30-day comment period.  If this
all happens by early next week, we should still have permits by the
beginning of November. I will continue to hammer home the importance of that
schedule.  Some of us will be on a conference call with Roger and one of the
EPA attorneys tomorrow to try to "get inside their heads" a little bit
better regarding why they are the only Region interpreting their ESA
responsibilities so strictly.  We will debrief you after the call.  Scott

EXECUTIVE SUMMRAY
CPUC Settles Filed Rate Doctrine Case with SoCal
CPUC Kills DWR Rate Agreement, Davis May Reconsider Old Senate Bill


CPUC - SoCal Suit
In a closed hearing today, the California Public Utilities Commission voted 5-0 to settle its filed rate doctrine case with SoCal Edison.  The implications could save SoCal from an otherwise immanent bankruptcy, though bankruptcy remains a real threat.  Under the agreement, the CPUC has stipulated the following points, which have not yet been formalized by Administrative Law Judge, Ronald Lew:

The CPUC agrees to maintain a level of rates necessary for SoCal to pay off under-collect through 2003.

All surplus revenue (revenue above O & M) generated from any source must be applied to SoCal's back debt.

SoCal agrees to pay no dividends on its common stock from now until 2003, or until all back debt has been recovered.  If SoCal's debt has not been recovered by 2003, the CPUC will extend appropriate rates levels necessary for SoCal to recover its debt through 2004.  Dividend payouts on SoCal common stock will be subject to CPUC approval during this extension.

100% of any revenue SoCal receives/generates from FERC/generator refunds will be applied to SoCal's debt.

Once SoCal's back debt has been recovered, any surplus revenue generated from the CPUC rate hikes will be refunded to ratepayers.

CPUC - DWR Rate Agreement
The fact that the PUC voted down the DWR rate agreement (by a 4-1 margin) puts Governor Davis and Treasurer Angelides in a very awkward position.  This leaves Senator Burton's bill, SB 18XX, as the vehicle that sets to payment path for the revenue bonds to repay the General Fund.

However, as late as this morning, Governor Davis vowed (through his spokesman) that SB 18XX was "dead on arrival" and would be vetoed.  This move by the PUC puts pressure on Davis to sign SB 18XX in order to protect the bonds and the long-term power contacts he has negotiated.

However, 18XX violates the terms of a number of the long-term power contacts negotiated by the governor earlier this year.  For example:

SB 18XX splits the revenue streams for payment of the General Fund's revenue bonds and payment to the DWR for power.  It clarifies the funds that will go to repay the General Fund, but is much less clear on the funds to pay the DWR for power.  SB 18XX leaves the long-term contracts signed by the governor open to review and renegotiation - something that the governor remains publicly unwilling to do.

SB 18XX also violates the terms of the bridge loan the state negotiated with Shearson Lehman earlier this year.  The terms of the bridge loan explicitly state that if 18XX is passed, the banks can accelerate the loan or impose penalty terms of interest on the state.  These terms were suggested by the governor as a means of forcing the legislature to support his DWR rate agreement rather than Burton's.  Of course, this effort failed when the legislature easily passed SB 18XX.  Today's PUC action further complicates the situation.

While on the surface this would seem to force the governor's hand into signing SB 18XX, that may not, in fact, happen.  It would not be out of character for the governor to instead veto SB 18XX, then force either the legislature or the PUC to "play ball" with him in order to repay the General Fund.  Thus, another leverage point has been created.  We will continue to monitor the situation to attempt to determine the likelihood of Davis signing or vetoing SB 18XX.

Greetings All,

On October 7th at 2:57 p.m. (CST), Cindy gave birth to our son, Andrew
Joseph Edward.  Andrew weighed in at 6 lbs. 12 oz. and is 19 3/4 inches
long.  This makes him a very light feather weight, but we intend to get his
weight up for future Olympic competition.  Mom is doing fine but feels like
she has been hit by a truck.

We thank you in advance for all of your good wishes!

I hope this e-mail finds everyone in good health...and perhaps with a

made me shiver, with every option they delivered, bad news in theBoardroom,
I couldn't believe the pending doom, I can't remember if I cried when I
read about Skilling step aside but something nauseated  me from deep inside, the
day, that Enron shareholders, cried. So...

Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the sky

Did you write off your shares enough or did you have faith in Jeff above,
if the headlines told you so, and do you believe in book-it-n'-roll, can mark
to market save your p&l and can you teach me how to print money on deal
flow? Well I know that you're in not in ruin I saw your balance in the
credit union, you sold off all your shares and I dig those market bears. He
was a lonely boomer CEO with a big old House in River O.  but I knew I was
out some dough, the day, Jeff stepped aside. I started singin...
Chorus

Now for ten years we've been on a roll and all are friends are on the dole
but that's not how it used to be, when the Ken Lay sang for the George and
Barb while Rice screwed Amanda in an rental from Harold Farb,  oh and while
Skilling was looking down, the stock price has made him frown the
shareholder return, has really made him burn, and while he had plenty of
jack, he had lost the knack and had come under attack, , the day, Jeff
stepped aside. We were singin...
Chorus
Helter Skelter in a summer swelter the electricity market was a limit
melter, eight hundred bucks and climbing fast, California credit limit had
quickly past, the governor tried to get some bills past,  Enron's
receivables have quickly amass, now everyone ran to  in Washington, the
lawsuits have just begun, just before the price would fall, Gov. Gray
bought it all, as the dust is settling, will prove that government mettling will
certainly be, a huge catastrophe, the day, Jeff stepped, aside. We started
singin...
Chorus
Oh and there we were all in one place, a company that needed its space with
no floors left to grow, so come on, Jeff be nimble, Jeff be quick, Jeff S.
built a new deodorant stick because hubris the devils only friend, oh and
as I watched that tower build, but I doubt it will ever be filled, no more
recruiting trip; as HR doles out more pink slips; and as the building
climbed high into the sky to quite the contractor delight  I saw
shareholders shuttering with fright, the day, Jeff stepped aside. He was
singin...
Chorus
The burning question that I don't know is who can replace him as CEO cause
the company won't be the same, he transformed the industry his success is
plain to see but from natural gas to electricity, Dynegy tried, and  Duke
has dreamed but I hate to tease, they are just Enron wanna-be's, and in
hindsight its easy to mock his leaving the firm in a shock, I'm just I had
sold my stock, the day, Jeff stepped aside, and they were singin...
Why, why did they throw a pie in his eye? Mortgaged the company to the sky

Gentlemen,
Ken asked me about storing antibiotics at Dabhol in case there is an anthrax scare at the site.  I told him amoxicilline, which they have in abundance, will work.
I checked with our doctor and she confirmed this is true, but it must be taken for 60 days.  More effective is doxecycline ( much less expensive than cipro).
In any event, our doctor is researching our options with International SOS and will work with us to set up a protocol for handling any suspected anthrax cases at Dabhol, or anywhere in India for that matter.  Once we have this down, we will look to expand it to all of our employees world-wide who require such assistance.  I will get back to you in a few days with the details.

Privileged and Confidential Joint Defense Communication

Here is the "motorcycle" argument, excerpted from the 10/15/01 transcript:

MR. REBEIN: Thank you, Your
Honor. Good afternoon. I will be arguing
on behalf of the defendants, as will my
colleague, Mr. Griffin. And then I think
also appearing today and arguing will be
Mr. Eisenbrandt and Mr. Flaherty on behalf
of their clients. We've tried to divide up
this argument, Your Honor, under -- to
cover of as many bases as we can with as
little repetition as possible.
And so I want to -- in the interest of
the good use of time, Your Honor, I want to
begin this argument by telling you about
the motorcycle trip that I just returned
from in Texas. On that trip, I went with a
friend of mine, and he had a new
motorcycle. And I asked him, "Okay, how
many gallons does that tank hold?" And he
said, "Well, Honda says five gallons."
Well, in Oklahoma, the first time we filled
up, sure enough, it took 5.2 gallons. And
he turned to me, and he said, "That
bastard."
Then we went to Texas, and we filled
up, and it took 5.3 gallons. Then he
turned to me, and he said, "Those bastards;
it's a conspiracy."
Now, I didn't tell him that my
friendship with Rex Sharp would provide me
with a nationwide remedy for this problem,
because I could have told him that what we
needed to do was for me, even though I
didn't buy the gasoline, to return to
Kansas where we bought none of the
gasoline, where I would sue on behalf of
all buyers of gasoline against all sellers
of gasoline for the last 25 years
nationwide, and all I would have to do is
say the words, "There was a conspiracy to
mismeasure." How? I don't know; they've
got all that information. When? I don't
know, but it had to be in the last 25
years. Who? I don't know, so let's
include all of them. And where? Well,
there's only one guy I know well enough to
make these arguments to, and that's Judge
Smith, so let's do it there.

2)  "JH Jose LNG" -- prepared and presented to Bollenger/Delahunt staffers last week for their trip to Caracas

3)  "LamedaLetter" -- prepared and sent to General Lameda after meeting with him, Vicenzo Paglione, and Nelson Nave in Caracas on July 6

4)  "JoseCriticalTimingMemo06-27" -- prepared and sent to Nelson Nava and others in PDVSA Gas prior to July 6 meeting with Lameda, et al

5)  "JoseChavezCallMemoJune25" -- prepared as briefing memo to Ken Lay in anticipation of arranging a call between him and President Chavez; attached to it as further background is an older project description memo

6)  "Jose LNG Background Chavez Call" -- a slightly earlier version of the Lay prep memo for the President Chavez call that shows some additional info and a slightly different approach to the pitch in the call;  I still think the later version is preferable, but thought you might find the contrast and additional info useful

You may also be interested to know that there is a CERA decision brief dated August 2001 discussing some of the political/project development issues we discussed with you today.  Please advise if you think this would be useful.

Please do not hesitate to call if you have any questions or require any further information.

By the way, I got a call back from Greg Simmons in the BLM State Office in
Arizona - my question to him was whether or not a proposed ROW across the
Agua Fria National Monument would constitute a "Fatal Flaw."  He indicated
that it likely would be a fatal flaw.  He said that it would take "an act of
congress" literally, not figuratively, to put a pipeline across a National
Monument.  The boundary of the Monument is the east side of I 17, south of
Cordes Junction - I don't know if we can stay on the west side of the
Interstate there, but we might oughta check it out - it looks like we could
get into some pretty rough side-sloping, two-toning.  FYI.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I had an hour long, fruitful meeting with Energy Secretary Martens last night. He was very supportive of our import
project for industrials but, I did not convince him on the concept of CFE's bids (i.e. Rio Bravo IV) to be modified,
so as to call for IPP or PPA's (imported power) indifferently.

He gave me two solid arguments:

- CFE (i.e. Mexico) cannot depend on imported power from the US (Texas) on a long term basis (25 years), since
there is no formal agreement between both countries that will support it. This is an even stronger argument after
the September 11th events, when the US can call for  national emergencies whenever needed.

Secretary Martens shared with me the problems they faced in Baja California during the California energy crisis,
when Natural Gas supply was cut out, on three or four occasions, because of a State Government emergency
decree (i.e. supply contracts between SDGE and CFE were not honored).

-  We are very late to request modifications on the Rio Bravo IV bid, which has been postponed for early December.
He offered to look into it for 2002 bids, providing the bilateral agreement is in place.


Regarding the import project for industrials, he volunteered his support with TAMSA, AXA, DESC or DeACERO, since
the concept of importing/trading power in the ERCOT market, is a good story for him to sell.

Finally, he told me that the transmission cost methodology will be available by the end of this month (he hopes that the
CRE will load it in its Internet Site).

Regards,    Jaime  _______

Jeff,
I have just returned from U Penn recruiting and it was a very successful trip.  In response to Aziz Fakir's e-mail, he was interviewed by Christie Patrick and Chris Hilgert on 1st rounds and was passed onto 2nd rounds.  He was their top candidate.  However, during second rounds, interviewing with Jen Frazer and Sarah Mulholland, he was not passed onto SuperSaturday.  From talking to Jen and Sarah, he did not rank as high as other candidates did.
We interviewed 20 people for second rounds.  All of the candidates were top-notch and the competition was staunch.  We are bringing back 11 Analyst for Final Rounds in Houston.  I can provide you with the evaluations of Aziz and if you want to bring him down we can.
Jen also meet with Jonathan Tyburski and she feels that we should renew his offer.  I will let our office know and we will start the paperwork.
Please let me know your decision.
Thank you,

Mark and Frank, in addition to the emails I sent to Frank about Devon and mark about PPL, here is a summary of the where we stand on some of the hot ISDA negotiations and what, if anything, needs to be done right away.

PPL Energy-- the schedule was negotiated.  Darren V. in credit and I were working to correct some errors and issues re: the guaranty.  Darren can discuss.  This is the ISDa that is ready to move and should move.  Mark, I think I forwarded to you the lastest emails from this week from Darren.  But in any case, if another lawyer can check this file and call Darren if they have any questions, he would be quick to get back to that persona and get them up to speed.

Devon - Frank and I spoke about Devon today.  The counterparty had put the file on file because Devon was too busy focusing on the acquisition of Mitchell Energy (the company built by the guy who also built the Woodlands).  Now, Devon is ready to move forward and requested a blackline.  Jason has asked that we hold off until he can review credit issues in light of the acquisition.

Welch's -- Jason Williams and I have worked on this one very closely and Jason has attended every conference call with me.  We have gone back and fault on the thresholds and Jason sent some new ones, I faxed them to the counterparty and we have not heard back from them.  I emailed Jason today to ask him to please follow-ip to ask about the thresholds. Otherwise, we have updated blacklines in the file.  I have asked several swap attorneys about questions before I moved forward but Sara has been the second point person.  Check with Jason to see if the attorney follows up -- she might be on vacation.  Keegan also has the phone number of the attorney's assistant who knows how to reach her when she is out of the office on a part time (or summer) schedule).

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


In addition to the Concentration Limit NA Gas P/L notification issued below, I believe there should also be a P/L Notification on NA Gas Commodity Group Limit, but the DPR reporting does not reflect it currently.  Lavorato has a "Cross-Commodity" line on the Business Unit DPR that reflected $18,670 MM VaR and ($23,583 MM) P/L.  This does not roll up into the NA Gas Commodity Group line which had $55,509 VaR and ($67,838 MM) P/L, both below the $85 MM Commodity Group limit, but it was appropriately included in the Business Unit VaR and P/L.

I obtained the detail of this cross-commodity line by reviewing the Concentration Limit DPR:

VaR	P/L
Gas	  18,580 	  (24,659)	 (a)
Power	       233 	        376
Residual Fuel		        545
F/X		        155
Total		  (23,583)

Business Unit DPR:
NA Gas	  55,509 	  (67,838)
Gas in Cross-Commodity		  (24,659)	 (a)
Total		  (92,497)



According to the Policy, all commodities traded within a business unit should have a limit approved by the CRO.  I can see how we might want to allow some leeway in the application of that requirement, but not to the extent of $18.6 MM VaR.  So my recommendation is:

1) Require the Gas and Power position in Lavorato's cross-commodity books to be rolled up into Gas and Power Commodity Group results on the Business Unit DPR, and compared to the Commodity Group VaR limits established for Gas and Power.  This would not have caused a VaR violation today as we recently increased the commodity group limit for Gas to $85 MM, only a P/L notification.  And while Power is not material now, it has been in the past, and could easily be again, and Power is a standard Americas commodity group.

2) Grant an "Other" VaR limit of $X (a small amount) that authorizes Lavorato to trade other commodities. That at least limits this other activity and will require him to discuss with the you if he wants to take an exceptionally large position in a commodity other than Gas and Power.

I think protecting the integrity of the Commodity Group limits is also important from the perspective that the Business Unit management is not really responsible for the Concentration Limit DPR (Lavorato and Kitchen do not even have access to view it!), and they are not on the distribution list for notifications on those limits. So as far as Lavorato/Kitchen is concerned, as currently reported they had no P/L notifications today as Power made some income so the business unit only lost ($97MM) vs it's $100 MM VaR limit. But the company lost ($119 MM) on gas, as noted in the e-mail below, and proper reporting of all of Lavorato's gas and power positions in comparison to his corresponding Commodity Group limits would have resulted in a Commodity Group P/L notification of ($92 MM) vs. the $85 MM limit.

We already eliminated all the position limits for Gas and Power.  Although the Concentration Limit DPR is accurately reflecting activity, we should probably make sure the VaR and P/L is being clearly reported on the Business Unit DPR as well, as that is the one that much of management of the company is still focused on.

Do you agree?   We can discuss when you're back in the office.

Regards,
Cassandra.

Can Brad Richter and Savita Puthigai attend the next trader meeting you have to let all the traders know that Savita and her organization (call center, product control, business analysis, trader support, etc.) now report officially to Brad Richter going forward and not Jay Webb?

Savita and I discussed this today and we both agree that this is best and that explicit change should occur now.  Savita is still committed to staying until the end of 2001, getting in some new talent in her group, training Brad, working with Webb, taking care of the traders, etc.  I will talk with her in December or January about what might be next for her.

Jay Webb is also supportive of this.  When he and I agreed that Savita reporting to him was taking him away from a large, complex development job, he said Brad should take the role.  Jay works well with Brad and thinks Brad, with time, will work well in Andy Zipper's old role.  Jay also signed a new contract recently and is committed to leading all technical and operational issues for EnronOnline and will be working closely with Brad and Savita.

Let me know your thoughts.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Richard,
Today Stacy and I spoke with Mike Farrell, Adkins' attorney.  It was brief and to the point.  I told him that his August 8, 2001 demand letter makes no reference to a verbal deal for a fixed price done on March 6 that was confirmed in writing by fax to his client on March 8.  Farrell told me that Adkins had not advised him of any such deal.  Farrell, who is quick on his feet, asked me to send him any writing signed by his client to this effect.   Once he sees that the confirm is the type which does not require a counter-party signature, Farrell may try to raise a statute of frauds issue, given that the deal confirmed could not have been fully performed within one year.
However, there are at least two counter-arguments.  First, the underlying base contract that was assigned to ENA from CES was signed by Adkins; in fact, to that base contract is attached a confirm for one-year floating index price deal with an evergreen clause, which I think is the deal Adkins is trying to enforce--and that confirm is signed only by CES.  Second, since (as John confirmed for me a moment ago) we hedged the fixed price deal, we may have good promissory estoppel arguments sufficient to trump a statute of frauds argument.
Farrell also mentioned a conversation with Wade Price in ENA Customer Service, during which Price advised Adkins that Adkins in fact had a floating price contract.  I asked Farrell when that conversation occurred, and Farrell could only say that it ocurred some time in the year 2000. Stacy and I are following up with Price on this.  Preliminarily, such a conversation could have occurred; however, we so far appear to have a very reasonable explanation.
In brief, our back office was drinking from a fire hose during the time of the CES contract assimilation, and this and other deals were not getting entered into the correct system.  For that reason, (a) ENA continued to pay Adkins based on the old floating index price from some months after March 2000, until this and other mispayment issues were caught by an internal audit, and (b) if Price had been called by Adkins before the corrections were made would have assumed, based on what was in the system at the time, that the old floating index price contract was still current.  Price keeps a log of phone calls and will be reviewing them in preparation for a further interview by us.
As Stacy mentioned, the really interesting point is the timing of Adkin's purported call.  Although this remains speculation at present, Adkins would have been losing money for the first several months, maybe until around July-August 2000, as the index was under the fixed price during that time period.  However, Adkins may not have been on notice of this until he received the first couple of checks.  Given that payment for Appalachian gas runs a month or so slower than elsewhere,  Adkins may not have received those checks until July-August.  By around August 1, the Appalachian index price had already risen above the fixed price.  In other words, with the benefit of being several months down the road, Adkins realized that this was going to be a banner year for Appalachian gas prices during the later heating season (and was).  So, perhaps Adkins called Price with an agenda in mind, which was to take advantage of what he realized was a mistake by Enron.
Timing here again will be important.  If we coincidentally did not complete our internal audit until the Appalachian index price rose above the fixed price deal we had with Adkins, then Adkins will argue that ENA opportunistically changed its position on whether there was a deal when the index price rose.  This is exactly, of course, our position with regard to Adkins.  Stacy will be researching the gas prices during the relevant time frame.
You should also know that Adkins has reportedly done this in the past to our other Appalachian gas trader, Jim Javens.  John learned about this after the fact.  I will be following up with Javens.
The next step is for me to send to Farrell the confirm and any other documentation I want him to see, and follow-up with Farrell to attempt to narrow the fact issues.
I will keep you advised.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Greetings all --
Given my rather other-world state on yesterday's conference call, I wanted to fire off an e-mail to you to summarize current commercial activities on the Renewable Power Desk. I appreciate all the work you guys are doing and feel as though we're really gaining some traction.

Green Power Market Development Group -- We will be submitting a proposal to the Wind Energy Working Group of the Green Power Market Development Group (headed by Mark Crowdis of Think Energy) on Tuesday with a variety of pricing proposals for products ranging from physical commodity with green tags to green tags with embedded call options. Richard and I are working together to develop pricing for tags in the Pac Northwest, California, Texas and the East. I feel good about our chances of getting something done with these guys as they are feeling the heat to do something concrete after making so many public declarations of intent. As we move forward, I think we should all do a lot of thinking about other companies we should approach for this type of product. Once the Enron Building is juiced with wind power, we will be able to approach other fortune 500 companies with a straight face and encourage them to become Green Power Alliance Customers. During the week of September 11, I plan to be in Houston to work extensively on drawing up the guidelines for the Alliance Program and working more closely with Richard and Stacey and their EES contacts to develop green power products for up-stream marketing and new origination efforts.

Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- LADWP is the largest green power buyer among public power agencies in California. Their green power buyer is heavily understaffed (and somewhat outgunned in terms of industry knowledge). He has hired us to help him bring his contract negotiations to fruition, manage logistics for new projects and essentially sleeve new renewable power products through Enron's existing Master Services Agreement with LADWP. This is an exciting (although not very profitable at this point) opportunity to establish the nodes of the California Renewable Power Pool and we see this as a way to bring our Services Desk functions to bear on the renewable sector in California. I am meeting with FPL Energy next week to discuss becoming the logistics coordinator for their new wind projects in California.

Wind Development -- As you may know, I purchased an option on a large parcel of windy land in Central Washington with enXco, a wind development concern. We are marketing the project to two of the munis in the Pacific Northwest (Seattle City Light and Eugene Water and Electric Board). Both have expressed interest. This morning I am meeting with the City of Portland to try to convince Portland to follow Seattle's lead as a zero-carbon growth city and signatory to the type of Kyotoesque committments recently announced by New England legislators.

Renewable Portfolio Standard -- The proposed CA RPS has major implications for our business, from both a risk management and commercial opportunity perspective. We need to really drill down on this today and get as much insight as to the political climate as possible. Having witnessed the first meeting of the California Power Authority last Friday in Sacramento, I am personally convinced that the RPS will definitely be passed in some shape or form. If they pass a 1% requirement for new renewables next year, this translates into 430MWm off a 43,000MW peak load in CA. We have very good working relationships with several of the biomass generators in California, including generators with new resources, and we are actively negotiating a marketing agreement with one of them and considering taking a long position for the next couple of years. The critical question, of course, is who will actually have the short position in California? If it is just the DWR, then they will probably satisfy their requirement with their new renewables purchases. If the utilities end up serving load, they will be in the market looking for the least-cost resources, and new biomass will clearly be a part of the mix.

Pac Northwest RFPs -- Both PacifiCorp and Portland General Electric have RFPs out right now for green tags and retail marketing services. I am staying in touch with Bonneville Environmental Foundation, Green Mountain Energy and Community Energy to act as a wholesaler for their tag submissions. I want to get master services contracts in place with each of these entities to make it really easy for them to transact with us. We can use our market legs to get well-priced tags and then sell to them as they shoot for RFP successes. Bonneville Environmental, at a minimum, will need new biomass to blend in with their expensive wind energy tags.

Chicago -- Most of you probably met Mike Lindert at our Houston Renewables meeting earlier this month. He was the EES originator for the ComEd deal, and as you know, there is a significant renewable committment in Chicago. We need to get in front of the City of Chicago as soon as possible to talk about their next generation of renewable purchases. Stacey, I belive you have info on this.

Sustainable Products Training -- The Renewable Power Desk has donated RECs and CO2 offsets for the Sustainable Products Training in Austin, September 10 - 11. They are giving us lots of press and would like one or two of us to attend. If you are interested in heading up there for a day with me, please let me know. There should be a pretty good turnout among potential commercial and industrial customers.

Kinkos -- All indications are that our negotiations with Kinko's are going very well. The hope is to sell them a three-year fixed-price retail product and 100% wind tags. Richard and I are woking to source the tags. Success will be huge, as Kinkos is part of the Green Power Market Development Group.

I know that Richard and Stacey have other deals on the table, and Jesse has been busy working on finalizing our services deal with Edwards Air Force Base. I look forward to seeing you guys in Houston the week of September 11 and taking the next steps in formalizing our green product offerings.

Talk to you soon,

Joan, could you please set up a churn request to relocate Dave Neubauer's Houston office ECN3963 to ECN1354. Julie Armstrong (x33597) should be able to give you company/cost center for the move charges. Julie requested setting up this move after Linda Wehring's return next Monday, so request middle of next week churn date. Please also check with Linda (x36040) on Monday to see if she has anything to add to this request. Since this is not his primary office, there will not be very much to move other than equipment and furniture. Also should check 1354 to see if there is a marker board in there already or if we need to move one in there for him.
Pat, could you please outfit ECN1354 with VP style furniture (granite racetrack, Mueller chairs, black drum table, along with Barritt guest chairs if they are not already in there) before next week? This will prevent moving the furniture from level 39, then having to replace it when I back-fill the office next week.
Thanks for your help!

I understand what you are looking for, and Bob Hall and I look forward to sitting down with you to review operations costs for Enron Americas.  I do think it will be meaningful to you to look at the components of the aggregate number to understand all of the functions that are provided and the drivers behind the cost structure for each function.  They are different.  Some costs are impacted by number of transactions, some are not.  For instance, all operating companies are allocated a portion of the cost of producing the DPR each day and posting results on the Executive Reports Viewer.  Regardless of the number of transactions, there is a fixed cost for aggregating that information.   That fixed cost estimated for the year likely will not change.  What may change is the allocation methodology used -- i.e. if EEL adds four new product lines to be aggregated on the DPR and if it is a very manually intensive task to get that information daily, then we may adjust the allocations such that EEL's percentage of the total cost of producing the DPR will be appropriately increased.

For the past two years, we have created the operations budget for Enron Americas with a defined set of services as the underlying assumption in the budgets.  There have been times when we have had to add personnel to handle new businesses that have been created that were unknown during the budget process (ex:wellhead desk) or deals that are done that are very operationally intensive (ex: asset management deals).  When this happens, we calculate the fully-loaded cost of the person or persons required to support that new activity and have the commercial person responsible for that business sign off on the additional expense to be incurred that was not in the original operations budget - a change order to the original budget.

I know that Wes is coordinating the budget review meetings for Enron Americas, so I will work with him to make that happen.  In addition, Greg Piper and I are trying to get a time that works for you and John Lavorato early next week so that we can discuss the mechanics of a service level agreement.  --Sally

About 1 AM this morning, Burton closed down the Senate without voting out the Edison MOU.
Burton said there weren't the votes for it (which is true; there were about 6 votes for the MOU in the Senate), and he didn't want to "embarrass" Davis.
Burton said that there weren't the votes because the vote was a giveaway to big business, a corporate bailout, and a bad deal for consumers.
Davis responded by saying 1) the Assembly did a good job, 2) the Senate failed to do its job and 3) Davis would call a special session to start all over again and try to get an MOU.  The special session would begin in about 2 weeks.
Davis said that Edison promised him they wouldn't take themselves into voluntary bankruptcy in the interim.

GOVERNOR DAVIS COMMENTS ON FAILURE OF SENATE TO APPROVE EDISON LEGISLATION

Will Call 3rd Special Session to Keep Edison from Bankruptcy

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis made the following comments after legislation designed
to restore Southern California Edison to creditworthiness failed to win
approval in the California State Senate.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the State out of the
business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness.
Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done.

"It is critical to keep Edison solvent so that we do not lose 3,000
Megawatts of power from renewable energy and small power producers. We
worked hard to bring this energy, which was crucial in avoiding blackouts,
back on-line earlier this summer.

"I will call a Third Extraordinary Session, which will begin in
approximately two weeks, so that Edison can avoid bankruptcy. Edison has
assured me that it will not seek bankruptcy and that it believes that its
creditors will continue to show restraint."

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --

The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility.

As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds.

But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday.

"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation."

The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt.

Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts.

The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy.

"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done."

The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school.

The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing.

It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders.

While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds.

Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks.

The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks.

The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal.

"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

California Senate adjourns without voting on plan to save struggling utility

(09-15) 02:57 PDT SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) --
The state Senate adjourned early Saturday without voting on a plan to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy, and Gov. Gray Davis called an emergency legislative session for next month to try again to help the struggling utility.
As the California Legislature rushed to pass hundreds of bills and finish the 2001 session, a $200 million program to help the state's neediest schools won approval. So did bills to give driver's licenses to immigrants seeking citizenship and improve working conditions for shepherds.
But senators remained cool to Davis' idea of bailing out Southern California Edison. They failed to vote on the measure after it was approved last week by the Assembly, which also adjourned early Saturday.
"We didn't take it up because we didn't want to embarrass the governor," said President Pro Tem John Burton. "It would have been a rip-off of residential people to help big business and bail out a corporation."
The deal's quiet death closed more than five months of work since Davis first announced the plan in April, saying the state would pay $2.76 billion for Edison's transmission system and let the utility sell consumer-backed bonds to repay the rest of its $3.9 billion debt.
Without the deal, Edison faces bankruptcy along with Pacific Gas and Electric Co., the state's largest utility. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April, after amassing about $8.9 billion in debt due to last year's sky-high electricity costs. Edison says it has accrued $3.9 billion in debts.
The special session is meant to take another shot at saving Edison from sliding into bankruptcy.
"I am proud of the work done by the Assembly to get the state out of the business of buying electricity by restoring Edison to creditworthiness," Davis in a statement after midnight Saturday. "Unfortunately, however, the Senate has not gotten the job done."
The new school-improvement program would provide grants of $400 per student to schools with the state's lowest test scores. They will have nearly four years to improve scores or face sanctions as severe as closing the school.
The shepherd bill would give people who watch sheep some of the basic working conditions that other workers have in state law. Those include a 10-minute rest break for every four hours of work, tools paid for by the employer and toilets, lights and water in housing.
It also would put into state law a $1,050-a-month minimum wage for sheepherders.
While legislators toiled, Tuesday's terrorist attacks were never far from their minds.
Davis joined the Assembly for a brief memorial service that included a procession of lawmakers handing in letters they had written expressing their feeling about the attacks.
The Legislature approved sending $1 million from the California Victim Compensation fund to a similar program in New York to help victims of the terrorist attacks.
The letters will be printed in a special Assembly Journal.
"Here in California, our job is to keep the peace and preach tolerance," said Davis.

A new priest at his first mass was so nervous he could hardly speak.
After mass he asked the monsignor how he had done. The monsignor replied,
"When I am worried about getting nervous on the pulpit, I put a glass of vodka
next to the water glass.  If I start to get nervous, I take a sip."  So next
Sunday he took the monsignor's advice. At the beginning of the sermon,
he got nervous and took a drink. He proceeded to talk up a storm.  Upon his
return to his office after mass, he found the following note on the door:

1. Sip the Vodka, don't gulp.
2. There are 10 commandments, not 12.
3. There are 12 disciples, not 10.
4. Jesus was consecrated, not constipated.
5. Jacob wagered his donkey, he did not bet his ass.
6. We do not refer to Jesus Christ as the late J. C.
7. The Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are not referred to as Daddy,
Junior and the Spook.
8. David slew Goliath, he did not kick the shit out of him.
9. When David was hit by a rock and was knocked off his donkey, don't
say he was stoned off his ass.
10. We do not refer to the cross as the "Big T."
11. When Jesus broke the bread at the Last Supper he said, "Take this
And eat it for it is my body." He did not say "Eat me"
12. The Virgin Mary is not called "Mary with the Cherry,"
13. The recommended grace before a meal is not: Rub-A-Dub-Dub thanks for
the grub, yeah God.
14. Next Sunday there will be a taffy pulling contest at St. Peter's,
not a peter pulling contest at! St. Taffy's.


The origination of this letter is unknown, but it brings good luck to
everyone who passes it on. The one who breaks the chain will have bad
luck. Do not keep this letter. Do not send money. Just forward it to five of
your friends to whom you wish good luck and a great laugh.
You will see that something good happens to you four days from now if
the chain is not broken.

Thought it was about time for an update on Petchems, what has happened and what is happening.

FINANCIAL PRODUCTS

First trades in Europe done on  financial swaps  for Polypropylene, Low Density Polyethylene and Propylene.
USA continues to increase volumes dramatically on Benzene Toluene and Xylene driven by Steve and Adam. New business in the USA on Propylene and LLDPE.
Year to date we have transacted 790,000 tonnes of financial deals for the Petrochemical industy globally.
Already transacted Cal 02 benzene swap with Dupont USA.
USA olefines has been targeted for increase in deal flow Q3/Q4.

OPTIONS
Enron's first Benzene options transacted in Europe.

EOL
Styrene swap now launched in Europe and the USA one to follow soon.
4 new counterparties transacting.

NEW HIRES/PERSONNEL
I have interviewed 1 person ( Marathon employee) with a view to running our fledgling USA distribution business and "ghosting" the traders on Styrene, Toluene and Xylene.
We are in the process of interviewing a physical trader for London.
I expect Chris Shapland in Europe will be trading financial petchems in London by the return of the year and a junior replacement for him will then be required.
Rob Brewis is making great progress on market penetration and I expect to be trading physical olefines by Q4 in Europe.
USA Plastics group still needs a trader.

FUNDAMENTALS
Work is underway on the Europe web site. An analyst for this work is being sort. Meanwhile Chris is helping in the interim.

PROJECT WORK
Meeting with CONOCO Europe set for  Sep 4 to discuss taking all their Benzene and Propylene output either physically or financially.

Recent discussions with NCT ,a Dutch plastics distibutor, proved very interesting. Idea is to take a share in the company to have access to their physical exposure on Plastics/Polymers in Europe with a view to providing a new source of physical supply to NCT and manage their total price exposure fro their total sales volume. NCT turnover is c $91m.

Push on Propylene in Europe seen as the most attractive Olefin for Q4.

USA Aromatics dist business on Toluene ready to go.

Major interest from USA majors in Cal 02 Styrene and Benzene swaps.

PHYSICAL BUSINESS
Last but not least I almost forgot ,somehow we still keep very active on physical transactions across the whole range of products . With the hopeful addition of 2 new people we will be increasing our prescence in USA and Europe.

Hope this was useful.

Thanks

Stuart

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Stacy,

This will confirm our telephone conference with Mike Farrell, Franklin Adkins' attorney, today.  Based on my recommendation, you and I followed up with him today to see if Adkins still wanted to pursue his claim, despite our response to him.

Farrell told us that although his client had not yet received his written legal analysis, Adkins does not want to drop the claim.  Farrell told you and me that he thought the "mere sending of your confirm" did not overweigh the months that ENA paid Adkins under the index price, which established in Farrell's view a course of dealing between the parties that made the index price the correct price.  During this short telephone conference, Farrell never said whether his client had received the confirmation.  Of course, our position is that whether Adkins' telefax machine printed out the confirmation is irrelevant; we have the evidence necessary to show that we sent it.

Farrell told us that he expected to send us a response next week, continuing his demand for arbitration.  He did not say whether there would be any settlement offer in the letter.  I will advise you as soon as I receive Farrell's letter.

I would be very pleased to arbitrate this for you as your trial counsel.  I believe that Farrell is correct in stating that there are sufficient facts to create a course of performance issue, on which arbitrators could rule in favor of Adkins.  However, I believe that we have a persuasive argument that ENA paid the incorrect price only as a result of a clerical error.  In order to support this argument, we also need to develop the following:

1.  Did Franklin Adkins do or not do anything as the result of receipt of payment of the index price for a period of time that disadvantaged him?   The timing of when Adkins first realized he was being paid the index price may be critical.  I need to speak to the right person about how we would have made payment and what business documents were sent to Adkins after the confirm was telefaxed, and get copies of all those documents.  Could someone tell me who that would be?

2.  Did ENA correct the price before or after the spot market price rose above the contract price? (You had kindly agreed to do the homework on this).  Also, I need Mary to advise me when she was instructed to perform the internal audit, why and by whom, and get copies from her of all her file material on that audit.

I greatly appreciate your and everyone else's help.  If anyone has any thoughts on other homework we could or need to be doing, please let me know.  If anyone knows of someone else who needs to be in the loop on this, please let me know.

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt

Ken,

Thanks for having the call yesterday.  I am a believer in Enron and we are
buying your debt.

Here's short feedback on the call.  I give the call a B-/C+ grade.  If you
want a good example of a company call listen to the tougher calls So Cal Ed
had for investors.  They talked with investors twice weekly for months.
There is an honestness and openness about the calls that worked to keep
investors informed.

The angry exchange with the short seller was a blunder.  No matter what the
question, no matter how stupid or obnoxious, the Enron answer should always
be empathetic and pointedly factual.  Yes, you will have to open the kimono
more than Enron ever has to restore confidence.

ENE has become more a financial institution, and less an energy company
with hard assets.  You are in a confidence game pure and simple.  Any
attempt at keeping things close to the vest will backfire and exacerbate
the current crisis.  If you want to see disclosure in financials, look at
Citi's...

ENE is having an encounter session with the entire investment community.
This is not a time to be aggressive and smart.  It is a time to be open,
honest and self-effacing.

Third party confirmation will go a long way in restoring confidence which
means 1) Moody's maintains their rating or limits the change to a one-notch
downgrade (bond rating) with stable outlook restored (the Moody's analyst
is pissed you surprised with the write-off), 2) the SEC gives ENE a fairly
clean report (no self-dealing found) on their transactions with private
equity partnerships, 3) no more large surprise write-offs, 4) outside
auditors continue with unqualified audit reports, 5) operating earnings
targets are met for this year and next, and 6)fuller disclosure is made in
quarterly releases.

Of course, if any fraud or malfeasance is found, you guys and ENE are
history.

I have my ass on the line because I believe in ENE.  We have made
investments.  ENE is in the shitter because of ENE's past communication and
behavior mistakes.  Be humble, be smart, and change.

Good Luck!

Jeff

P.S.  You state there is a Chinese wall between LJM and ENE.  Why in the
world then would you have the same guy, Fastow, play key controlling roles
in both organizations?  If you want to pay him, pay him.  Keep it simple.

I am glad Skilling is gone.  I wouldn't touch your company's debt while he
was there.  I hated him and his attitude?.and my past exposure to him was
extremely limited.

The Premier's Office and the Ministry of Energy have received John Lavorato's letter setting out the offer of 500MW from New York .  Judy Hubert  (Assistant Deputy Minister, Energy Policy) and her staff have been given the task of reviewing the proposal and concept.  Garrett Tripp and I spoke yesterday to Chris Cincar, an economist who works for Judy.  We reviewed the rationale for the proposal with Chris and made the following points: a) we see no supply adequacy problem even in the event Pickering A is delayed; b) the purpose of the proposal is to offer an insurance policy so that the gov't can firm up a market opening date of March 1 without any concern about Pickering; c) the prices in any transaction completed pursuant to the proposal or something similar would not set the pool prices in Ontario;and  d) we emphasized that this was power for delivery during onpeak hours only. Chris asked for some further data regarding historical NY prices for the March through June period in 2001 and prior years  and for a comparison of the onpeak prices with 7x24 prices. Chris is away next week and we will be speaking to him again after Labour Day. Chris indicated that he wants to talk about the proposal to the IMO and other potential power suppliers.  Thinking more about this, if in fact this is something Ontario pursues, Garrett and I think that the obvious  governmental agency to be the counterparty would be  OEFC, which will hold a wholesaler licence in Ontario.  OEFC could issue an RFP for the power required and secure the power from a range of suppliers outside the Province.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Received the following additional information late yesterday from Speaker Hertzberg's chief of staff regarding Direct Access in the legislation working its way through the Assembly.  He relayed the information during an informational hearing that an Assembly committee had on the bill yesterday in Sacramento.  See previous note attached below for more a detailed description of DA provisions in the bill:
A new print of the bill is likely to be issued today.
With respect to DA, the Governor is apparently responsible for the temporary suspension of DA in the bill.
Assembly Ds and other market participants lobbied him hard, explaining that, since the bill covers all costs of bonds and DWR contracts through "exit fees," there is no reason to suspend DA.
The Governor is resisting hard, stating that "he wants time for the market to stabilize."
So it looks like the Governor's plan is to 1) have a bill that provides for Direct Access as of 1.1.03 and 2) have the PUC "temporarily suspend" DA from September 1 to 1.1.03.
We're continuing to work with with business customers to eliminate, or significantly shorten, the suspension.
The bill apparently will also have amendments stating that any customer who has switched by August 23, 2001 (yesterday) will not be responsible for any DWR going forward contracts.  The customer will have to pay for any power consumed that DWR purchased on the IOUs' behalf between Jan 17 and the date of the switch.
The bill apparently will require that any customer switching between yesterday and Sept 1 be responsible for DWR going forward contracts (though details of how that would work were not clear).
The stated reason for wanting to insert an amendment on the August 23rd date is to prevent a "rush" to Direct Access between now and Sept 1.
There are currently NO efforts to break or othewise dissallow any contracts signed prior to Sept 1.
Finally, the bill apparently will also give self-generation priority over Direct Access in each "open season." The bill would set aside 250 MW of the short position each year for customers to do self gen.  If the self gen is not subscribed, the MWs would go to DA.
The bill, including these amendments and other amendments related to other issues, is supposed to be released today.
The bill will be heard in the Assembly committee on Monday afternoon.
We continue to work with the business customers to improve the DA and self gen provisions.
It remains unclear whether there is sufficient support for the bill to pass the Assembly.
The politicians are very reluctant to pass any "Edison bail out bill" and the political pressure not to vote on any "bailout" is significant and growing.  But the Governor is working the bill very hard.
Mirant is actively working against the bill.
Mirant is passing around a poll allegedly showing that any member that votes for a "bailout" could lose re-election.  Mirant is also distributing a letter implicitly threatening to take Edison into involuntary bankruptcy if the bill passes.
The bill also has to make it through the Senate.  Our lobbyist had a conversation yesterday with the Senate President, John Burton, who said flatly that "he's not doing anything."  But there is much to trade in the final weeks of the session, and the possibility of Burton doing a deal is 50-50.
With respect to the bill's provisions preventing Edison from paying wholesale providers with the "dedicated rate component" included,  Edison representatives at the hearing yesterday announced that Edison intends to issue first mortgage bonds to pay the suppliers.  Edison also said that, under the Assembly version of the bill, Edison believes that it would have the borrowing capacity to issue the first mortgage bonds.

Generators flock to get low-cost loans for new plants

Despite energy companies' claims that California is a bad place to do business, dozens of electricity generators want to cash in on low- cost state loans to build power plants.
Giants like Enron Corp. and Reliant Energy, along with a handful of small companies that generate electricity through windmills and solar power, have submitted proposals to the California Power Authority. The authority has billions to spend on new power plants that would keep Californians' homes from going dark when electricity is scarce.
Generators have complained that the state hasn't paid them in full for power deliveries, and they say pending legislation could make it more difficult to do business in California . But financing deals offered by the brand new power authority are too good to pass up.
"Right now, it's hard to tell if your investment will pay off," said Sandy Fruhman, spokeswoman for Reliant. "Going this route seems safe."
This morning, the five-member power authority will begin discussing proposals to build plants that would be used to bolster electricity reserves.
The authority is charged with everything from encouraging construction of new power plants to helping low-income homeowners buy energy-efficient refrigerators. While critics have called the agency an unnecessary new bureaucracy, its five members could have a profound impact on the state's energy future.
They have up to $5 billion to spend and are expected to soon begin signing contracts to provide financing for companies that want to build so-called peaker plants, which would be used when electricity supplies are low. The authority also will reserve the right to eventually own the plants -- meaning the state's role in energy markets would continue long into the future.
The goal is to make sure California has a 15 percent energy reserve at all times, says S. David Freeman, chairman of the authority. When power is scarce and prices are climbing, the authority would provide cheap electricity .
"We'll be the Wal-Mart of energy," said Freeman, who is one of four authority members appointed by Gov. Gray Davis. The fifth member is state Treasurer Phil Angelides.
Freeman says encouraging the development of power sources that rely on renewable resources like wind and the sun is one of his top priorities.
Power plants typically use natural gas to run the turbines that produce electricity . Skyrocketing natural gas prices last winter led in part to the surging electricity prices that bankrupted Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and plunged the state into crisis.
The Davis administration has been criticized for shutting out renewable power companies when it signed long-term contracts to buy electricity earlier this year. Now, Freeman says, the power authority could use up to half of its money to fund wind farms, solar-powered generators and other plants that rely on renewable sources.
"The renewables are a hedge against natural gas prices," he said.
Companies that have submitted proposals range from EnXco, which operates wind farms on the Altamont Pass and in Palm Springs and the Mojave Desert, and Yanke Energy, a Boise, Idaho, company that turns wood and other waste from landfills into power.
Details of their proposals will be released today.
Freeman said dozens of energy companies, including Enron and Reliant, had submitted proposals to erect gas-fired peaker power plants. The state would offer financing for the plants, which would be run by the companies.
Reliant and Enron officials both said their proposals called for their companies to oversee the construction of the plants, but the state would own them. The plants would be built by next summer.
Those proposals come amid increasingly heated rhetoric by the group representing power generators.
Jan Smutny-Jones, spokesman for the Independent Energy Producers, has blasted the state for failing to fully pay companies for energy they've supplied California . He said legislation such as a bill that would limit energy companies' profits made "countries like Bangladesh or Bulgaria more stable places to invest in."
PUC vote on direct-access power deals blocked for a week

A conservative appointee to the state Public Utilities Commission blocked a vote yesterday on banning businesses from cutting private electricity deals with generators, saying he wanted to give more firms time to sign up.
Commissioner Richard Bilas put a one-week hold on the PUC action to suspend direct access, a major element of California 's 1996 deregulation plan that lets consumers bypass the utilities and shop around for better deals on power.
Bilas' move drew an exasperated response from fellow commissioner Carl Wood, who said the delay in approving the ban was letting big companies desert the utilities and sticking small customers with a greater share of the state's multibillion-dollar power bill.
"There's a gold rush going on," said Wood, an opponent of deregulation. "They clearly are continuing to make these deals."
Bilas, a free-market advocate appointed to the commission by former Gov. Pete Wilson, said he held out a slim hope that state lawmakers would order the PUC to salvage the direct access option. But barring that, he said, the one-week delay could give businesses a final opportunity to lock in cheaper electricity contracts.
"That would be my hope," Bilas said.
As far back as January, direct access seemed doomed. The state Legislature directed the PUC to suspend the option as a way of keeping the largest number of consumers with the utilities so they could help pay the state for its power purchases.
Industry groups lobbied hard to preserve direct access, but none of the legislative proposals to do that has passed. Under the proposal that the PUC put off yesterday, direct access contracts would be banned retroactive to July 1.
Energy companies say they will challenge any retroactive ban in court. That in turn could delay the sale of $12.5 billion in state bonds to reimburse the treasury for the state's power buys.
The PUC has not estimated how much revenue the state stands to lose if direct access contracts dating to July are allowed to stand. In July alone, more than 6,000 businesses signed such deals.
The commission is now scheduled to take up the issue next Thursday. It is also supposed to consider an array of other measures needed before state Treasurer Phil Angelides can complete the state bond offering.
Those include a proposal that Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers pay $600 million more than Southern California consumers to reimburse the state for its electricity deals.
Calif. Official Asks FERC To Probe ISO, DWR 'Collusion'

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
WASHINGTON (Dow Jones)--Bill Jones, California 's secretary of state, Wednesday asked the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to investigate possible power market manipulation by state agencies.
In a letter sent Wednesday to FERC Chairman Pat Wood, Jones called for the commission to investigate "possible significant price and market manipulation of electrical energy by several energy-related entities in the administration of California 's Gov. Gray Davis."
Jones, a Republican, intends to challenge Davis in next year's gubernatorial election. Davis administration officials dismissed Jones's allegations as politically motivated.
Specifically, Jones wants FERC to determine if the California Independent System Operator, whose governing board consists of Davis appointees, ordered Southern California Edison Co. (EIX) to reduce its power output in order to lessen financial losses under long-term power-supply contracts entered into by the Department of Water Resources.
The letter was prompted by an Aug. 29 Dow Jones Newswires report that the ISO directed Edison to ramp down its low-cost, 1,500-megawatt Mohave generating station in Nevada at various times in recent months. The report cited ISO sources saying the motivation was to prevent the DWR from selling its contracted power supplies at a loss.
"The sole apparent purpose of these output reduction orders has been to diminish California 's need to sell surplus power at a loss," Jones said in the letter to FERC. "Such a loss would have a negative public relations impact on the Davis administration," he said.
The Mohave plant produces power around the clock for about $20 per megawatt-hour, as opposed to the above-market $70/MWh to $100/MWh the DWR is purchasing electricity for under long-term contracts.
"I am very concerned that the Cal ISO, in concert or collusion with the Department of Water Resources, is abusing its broad authority over the transmission of electrical power over interstate power lines in order to avoid political embarrassment for the Davis administration," Jones wrote.
"This abuse, because it involves the interstate transmission of electrical power, must be investigated by your agency under the authority granted to you by the Federal Power Act," Jones said in the letter to Wood, who was unavailable for comment Wednesday.
For months now, competitive power providers have been asking FERC to decide whether the ISO meets the commission's requirements for independent governance, given that its board is appointed by Davis and the state is deeply involved in power markets.
FERC was expected to issue an order in late July acting on the governance issue, but the order was stricken from the commission's meeting agenda at the behest of Wood and other commission members, according to FERC sources.
Those sources say they expect the commission to ultimately act on the matter, and rule that the politically appointed board runs afoul of FERC's requirement for independence from market participants.
Davis spokesman Steve Maviglio dismissed Jones's allegations as "ludicrous. It's all politics. There's no substance."
"It's completely false to say we're in collusion with Cal ISO," said DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo, calling Jones's allegations "really reaching" and without merit.
But industry officials note that the Mohave plant is a "baseload" power plant designed to run 24 hours a day, and not have its output adjusted in response to daily demand fluctuations.
"Mohave is a plant that should be running all the time," said Edison spokesman Steve Conroy.
ISO spokesman Greg Fishman, citing confidentiality rules, declined to discuss specific power-dispatch orders involving Mohave. But he did suggest that a lack of "flexibility" among generators could account for the anomalous orders directing the baseload plant to curb output.
The ISO has complained to FERC that generators are refusing the power-grid operator's orders to either ramp up or ramp down plant output as part of the ISO's responsibility to balance supply and demand across the state's power system.
"We have not seen the flexibility we like to see in the market," said Fishman. "In certain cases we may need to ask power plants to back down that ordinarily would not be asked," he said.

Calif. firm says Powerex overcharged B.C. Hydro export arm says matter already being addressed in a FERC proceeding

VANCOUVER -- B.C. Hydro's Powerex Corp. was accused this week of overcharging one of its California customers by $586-million (U.S.).
The allegations were made during a hearing into power prices that began on Wednesday in Washington, D.C., by the United States Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).
The hearings, set to conclude today, are examining claims by electricity customers in the Pacific Northwest, including the cities of Seattle and Tacoma, that power sellers overcharged them by as much as $2-billion between last December and June.
Yesterday, British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority spokesman Elisha Odowichuk said that representatives for the California Department of Water Resources alleged this week that power sellers in the Pacific Northwest, including Powerex -- the utility's export sales arm -- overcharged the agency by about $1-billion between December and June of this year.
Of those alleged overcharges, $586-million was attributed to Powerex, Ms. Odowichuk said.
The California Department of Water Resources is a state agency that took over electricity purchasing in January, after state utilities fell into debt and were not able to buy power on the spot market.
CDWR's statements are "inappropriate" because alleged overcharging in the California market is already being addressed in a separate FERC proceeding, she said.
"We believe they [alleged overcharges] are a separate issue and are already being dealt with," she said yesterday.
Ms. Odowichuk said that Powerex was a net power importer during the period in question, and that the company believes the allegations against it are unfounded.
Representatives for the CDWR were attending hearings yesterday and not available for comment.
Powerex has generated windfall profits over the past few years by selling electricity to out-of-province customers, especially California . But along with other power sellers, it has come under scrutiny for its pricing practices during periods when power prices spiked last year and in the first six months of 2001.
The state of California maintains it is owed almost $9-billion in refunds from power sellers.
During failed settlement talks in July between the state and power sellers, Powerex offered to reduce the amount it is owed by California purchasing agencies by $125-million.
That offer, along with others from U.S. power sellers, was rejected.
A FERC judge is now studying the California refund issue, and is expected to make recommendations to FERC by early November.
Powerex is owed $290-million by California customers, who ran into financial difficulties and were unable to pay their bills when power prices spiked last year.
The hearing into alleged overcharging in the Pacific Northwest is scheduled to wrap up this week, and recommendations to follow this fall.
California Utilities Protest Plan Giving State-Bought Power Priority Energy: Proposal could force distribution of more-expensive electricity purchased by California Department of Water Resources.

California 's two largest utilities are protesting a proposed requirement that could force them to distribute power the state has purchased before selling their own lower-cost electricity .
The state Department of Water Resources--which started buying electricity on behalf of 25 million Californians when Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern California Edison became insolvent earlier this year--is seeking the requirement because it has contracted for more power than is needed, PG&E said.
If forced to distribute that surplus power in place of typically lower-cost nuclear, hydroelectric and other energy from their generating sources, PG&E and SCE would face added financial hardships, and the higher costs eventually might show up in consumer rates, the companies said.
"This would not be in the best interest of utility customers," Southern California Edison said in a filing with the California Public Utilities Commission. The commission will consider whether to adopt the "must-take" requirement later this month, when it sets the terms by which the state will be repaid for its power purchases.
"We believe DWR has a current surplus of high-priced power under contract, and therefore is seeking authority from the CPUC to charge our customers for that high-priced power," Pacific Gas & Electric, a unit of PG&E Corp. of San Francisco, said.
In comments filed at the utilities commission earlier this week, Pacific Gas & Electric said the rate agreement would be illegal because Assembly Bill 1X--which put the state in the energy-purchasing business in January--does not allow customers to be charged for DWR power that is not delivered to them. Instead, the utility said, the law says the DWR may sell surplus power on the open market.
California entered the power business when a surge in wholesale electricity prices and a regulatory freeze on consumer rates created billions of dollars in losses for the two utilities. That eventually pushed Pacific Gas & Electric to seek protection from its creditors in Bankruptcy Court; SCE, a unit of Edison International in Rosemead, has avoided following suit but is insolvent and is seeking a financial rescue from the state.
The proposed rate agreement between DWR and the utilities commission guarantees that the water agency would recover whatever it spends on electricity for PG&E and SCE as well as Sempra Energy unit San Diego Gas & Electric, which is financially healthy but also turned to DWR for power after the state's primary power market collapsed in late January.
PG&E said one section of the draft rate agreement would require the utilities commission to order that DWR power be delivered to utility customers whenever the water agency requests, "even if the DWR power is millions, if not billions, of dollars more expensive than the utilities' own power supplies or power available from third parties."
The state has signed long-term power contracts totaling $43 billion at rates that average 6 cents to 8 cents a kilowatt-hour for so-called base-load power, or electricity produced by the large power plants that operate most hours of the day.
PG&E's cost of generation for its nuclear power is 3.5 cents a kilowatt-hour. SCE said cost of the power it generates through its plants averages about 4.5 cents a kilowatt-hour.
At issue is what is called a "must take" or "must deliver" clause in the agreement between the two state agencies. This would allow the DWR to force any surplus power on the utilities and require them to cut their own generation.
DWR spokesman Oscar Hidalgo said such surpluses would happen infrequently because the department also has short-term contracts that can be adjusted to reduce the amount of electricity the state must buy.
Nevertheless, many energy analysts believe that in the state's effort to use long-term contracts to lock in prices and tame the volatile wholesale power market, California officials purchased too much power and paid too much for it.
A Los Angeles Times analysis of DWR reports found that surpluses would probably peak in 2004, when the state has purchased electricity that amounts to 43% of the needs of the three large investor-owned utilities. But according to current trends, the utilities need the state to supply only about 35%.
Whether such surpluses are infrequent or become chronic, they can prove costly. In July, the state racked up $46 million in losses after selling excess power for one-fifth the price it paid. The state has not released data for August.
Assembly OKs Bill to Rebuild Edison's Finances Energy: Lawmakers battle late into the night over the $2.9-billion package pushed by Gov. Davis. Foes say the plan, which faces hurdles in the Senate, is a bailout.

SACRAMENTO -- Despite threats of a ballot backlash, the state Assembly late Thursday approved a $2.9-billion bill to restore Southern California Edison to something close to financial health.
Passage by a 41-32 vote, almost along party lines, came only after the Legislature's Democratic leaders arranged for Democratic Assemblyman Gil Cedillo, who had been home in Los Angeles with his ailing wife, to fly to Sacramento for a late evening vote.
The bill must still be reconciled with a different version that passed the Senate in July.
The bill would allow Edison to float bonds to pay off about three-quarters of the massive debt it accumulated during the energy crisis. The company would have to find its own way to handle the remaining debt of about $1 billion.
The bonds would be paid off by the top 180,000 of the utility's large and medium-sized business consumers. Homeowners and smaller businesses would not be burdened with the cost.
Gov. Gray Davis and other supporters of the bill say the bonds could be paid off without any additional electricity rate increases, but foes of the bill have challenged that assertion.
Even without a rate increase, the bill has been bitterly opposed by consumer activists, who have labeled it a bailout and have threatened a ballot initiative to reverse it. The prospect of running for reelection next year with such an initiative on the ballot has spooked many lawmakers, deepening their reluctance to vote for the bill.
But Edison and Davis have spent weeks lobbying intensely for votes. Majority Democrats argued that keeping the utility out of bankruptcy was in the public interest. Minority Republicans charged that the bill might not actually keep the utility out of bankruptcy, but would certainly place an unfair burden on business.
"Have we lost our minds?" asked Assembly Republican Leader Dave Cox (R-Fair Oaks). "Has this body lost its sense of direction? People outside must be thinking, 'These people must be drinking on the job.' "
The Assembly action was by far the most significant step in what has been a controversial six-month crusade to rescue the Rosemead-based utility through government intervention--a circus-like process that has flooded the Capitol with lobbyists for every special-interest group imaginable.
But the bill, SB 78xx by state Sen. Richard Polanco (D-Los Angeles), still faces major obstacles. The version that passed the Senate narrowly won approval. The Senate's Democratic leaders are now concerned that changes made by their counterparts in the lower house have made the measure even more politically unpalatable.
One indication of the closeness of the vote came shortly before debate began about 9 p.m. as Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) arrived in the chamber. Cedillo had been home with his ill wife, but Democratic leaders, needing his vote, arranged for him to fly back to Sacramento.
Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said Thursday that he and his colleagues would need a few days to review the dozens of amendments recently added to the bill. He predicted the upper house would probably make changes of its own and send a new version of the bill back to the Assembly for a final vote by Sept. 14, the deadline to pass legislation this year.
Consumer activists vow to continue their efforts to thwart the rescue plan in the Senate.
"This is one of those devastating displays of disregard for constituents' needs and consumer needs," said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. "At the end of the day, the people of the state of California are going to have to depend on John Burton and the Senate to stop this obscene giveaway."
This spring, Davis and Edison reached an agreement in principle for a government rescue of the utility. The company accumulated its huge debt last year and early this year when it had to buy electricity on the open market for far more than it could charge its customers under a state-imposed rate freeze.
But the proposal hit the Legislature like a ton of bricks, and has struggled ever since. With polls showing that the public considered the utilities to be culprits in the energy crisis, lawmakers have worried about the political consequences of voting for legislation perceived as a bailout. And five years after approving a landmark deregulation of the state's electricity market that was widely blamed for the problem, lawmakers worried about making another mistake.
Many lawmakers also wondered whether a utility bankruptcy was as harmful as supporters of the bill contend. California 's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., chose to take itself into bankruptcy in the spring rather than seek a government solution to its problems, and the lights did not go dark in Northern California as a result.
But Davis and other supporters of the bill argued that the state's only way out of the power crisis is to have the private utilities regain their financial health. That would allow the state to get out of the expensive business of buying power on behalf of the utilities' customers. Bankruptcy would only further delay the state's exit from the power business, they argued.
"This bill is complicated. It's complicated in my view because the issue is complicated," said Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), who presented the bill to the lower house. "But it is in my view the last piece of the puzzle we need to put out this forest fire."
Since January, California has spent billions of taxpayer dollars purchasing electricity to avert blackouts because the utilities were too encumbered with debt to continue supplying customers. State leaders hope to leave the power business in 2003.
Even so, the bill traveled a bumpy road in the Assembly. Lawmakers took out some elements of the plan to obtain votes in one committee, only to put them back in to get it through the next panel. And only a surprising Republican vote from Assemblyman Bill Leonard of San Bernardino allowed the bill to clear the Assembly's energy committee.
In the end, the bill is considerably slimmed down from what Davis and Edison officials first proposed in the spring.
Under the bill, Edison would be permitted to use the money from its bonds to pay off the debt it owes banks and the state's small, alternative energy producers. The company would use its own resources for the remaining $1 billion it owes large energy companies. Democratic lawmakers contend those companies engaged in price gouging during the energy crisis and are opposed to giving them all they are owed.
"We have been getting gouged by these guys for a year now, and this is our opportunity to give them a haircut," said Assemblyman Dario Frommer (D-Los Angeles). "They don't get any money from this, not one dime."
Edison representatives say the plan should allow the company to recover financially--but that it falls short of guaranteeing it would be made whole.

SACRAMENTO -- Enron Corp., the giant Texas-based seller of electric power, won a court ruling Thursday in its quest to guarantee the secrecy of hundreds of thousands of internal business documents sought by state lawmakers.
A Senate committee investigating price gouging in California 's wholesale electricity market subpoenaed Enron's documents in April, seeking records of electricity sales, bidding strategies, prices and out-of-state transactions.
The company refused to make the documents available without a court order protecting the confidentiality of the records. Enron sued July 11, and on Thursday Sacramento County Superior Court Judge Charles C. Kobayashi granted the company's request for a protective order.
The judge noted in his order that Enron is a business competitor of the California Department of Water Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of the state's two largest utilities last January.
"Although the committee argues that the Senate is not in competition with plaintiff," wrote Kobayashi, "the functions of the Senate and the Department of Water Resources are intertwined in so many ways that there is no doubt that not only may there be appearances of conflict, actual conflicts can arise."
Kobayashi's order is a reversal of an earlier, tentative ruling, in which he concluded that imposing a protective order for Enron would be an "unacceptable" intrusion by the courts into the internal operations of the Legislature.
Karen Denne, a spokeswoman for the Houston-based company, described executives as "very pleased" with the court ruling. "Turning over the documents was never the issue," she said, "The issue was always protecting our rights."
Enron officials will work with committee Chairman Sen. Joe Dunn (D-Santa Ana) to craft an agreement that details which documents will be reviewed by the eight lawmakers and their aides, Denne said.
Reliant Energy of Houston, another company that resisted demands for business records, on Wednesday signed a confidentiality agreement with Dunn's committee and will begin bringing 250,000 documents to a depository in Sacramento, said Reliant spokesman Marty Wilson.
Dunn said other companies have begun to deliver documents to Sacramento, but not all are fully complying with subpoenas.
"There are some major holes that have to be plugged by the market participants," he said.
On July 21, the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market voted to recommend that Enron be cited for contempt for not turning over its documents.
The full Senate has yet to vote on that recommendation.
The committee, which the Senate created in March, has focused its investigation on the private companies that purchased power plants after California moved to deregulate its electricity market in 1996.
California Assembly Passes Southern California Edison Rescue Bill
09/07/2001

LOS ANGELES -- The California Assembly late Thursday passed legislation that would rescue Southern California Edison from the brink of bankruptcy by authorizing the utility to sell $2.9 billion in bonds to pay off part of its debt.
Edison, which has a market capitalization of about $4.6 billion, has racked up billions of dollars in debt it accumulated from buying power at high prices on the open market because of the California electricity crisis.
The assembly voted 41-32 in favor of the measure and secured a vote from an assembly republican. The bill needed a minimum of 41 votes for passage. During the past six months, republicans have voiced opposition to an Edison bailout.
The legislation, which was passed by the State Senate in July and recently amended by the Assembly, would allow the unit of Edison International (EIX), Rosemead, Calif., to pay off commercial paper holders and small power producers with the bond sale. However, the utility will still need to raise about $1 billion to pay large generators.
The Assembly debated the bill for about two hours Thursday evening and attempted to introduce several amendments dealing with conservation easements. The proposed amendments were killed and the full Assembly then voted.
"We're encouraged by the forward progress the Assembly vote represents toward creating a workable framework to get the state out of the power procurement business and restore us to credit worthiness," said Bob Foster, Edison International senior vice president.
The bill "provides just $2.9 billion which still leave us at risk," Mr. Foster said.
The bill goes to the full Senate for a floor vote which could take place as soon as Monday, lawmakers said. Senate President Pro Tem John Burton (D-San Francisco) said this week that the bill, as amended by the Assembly, was "dead on arrival."
Other lawmakers, including State Senator Debra Bowen (D-Redondo Beach), also indicated that they would likely not support the bill as amended.
The Assembly version of the bill would give the state a five-year option to buy the utility's power lines for $2.4 billion, or an estimated two times the current book value.
When the Senate passed the Edison rescue bill in July, it only authorized the utility to sell $2.5 billion in bonds and gave the state the option during the next five years to buy the power lines at current book value of $1.2 billion.
The Senate has one week to decide whether it will pass the SoCal Edison rescue bill before the Senate adjourns for the year Sept. 15.
A state-mandated rate freeze prohibited SoCal Edison from passing on rising power costs to consumers, leading to the company amassing $3.9 billion in debt since May 2000.

Developments In California 's Energy Crisis At A Glance
09/07/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
THURSDAY:
--The state Assembly approves a deal to rescue Southern California Edison from bankruptcy by letting the utility issue $2.9 billion in bonds backed by ratepayers. The bill, by Sen. Richard Polanco, D-Los Angeles, carries the deal negotiated by the governor in April. The 41-32 vote was the bare minimum needed to pass the measure and came after hours of delays and debate on the bill.
--The Public Utilities Commission delays a vote on direct access -the option of consumers to switch from their local utility to a competitor for cheaper power or electricity generated using renewable fuels. Consumer advocates warn that businesses will use the time to convince officials that direct access should stay -thereby shrinking the pool of ratepayers from which the state plans to recoup its power-buying costs. Consumer groups fear that will force the state to raise rates on the remaining customers.
--State treasurer Phil Angelides says the state will have to re-time its expected sale of $12.5 billion in bonds because of the PUC's delay on suspending direct access and a host of other issues key to shaping California 's response to its energy debacle. The state must sell the bonds to repay the genreal fund.
--The Assembly Appropriations Committee approves a bill to alter how the California Department of Water Resources issues bonds. The bill, by Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, sets aside a portion of existing customer rates to pay for the $12.5 billion in bonds the department plans to issue this fall. It also requires the DWR to hold public hearings on their power procurement process. The bill now moves to the full Assembly for a vote.
--The PUC announces more than 400 businesses now are exempt from rolling blackouts, including plastic surgery clinics, power generators, blood and dialysis labs, jails, nursing homes and nursing centers. More than 9,000 applied for the exemptions, ranging from pet cemeteries and bakeries to Pacific Bell Park and amusement parks.
--Gov. Gray Davis signs legislation that requires an electric company or local publicly owned electric utility to immediately notify law enforcement agencies of the possibility of a rolling blackout. The measure, AB 4XX by Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza, D-Merced, makes permanent an executive order Davis issued on June 5, 2001, when many feared a summer plagued by rolling outages.
--Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee investigating possible price manipulation of wholesale energy prices, a judge rules. But the state must provide the energy company with a protective order that the judge will approve.
--Sen. Ross Johnson, R-Irvine, tries to amend a bill in the Senate to cut the salary of S. David Freeman, chairman of the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority. Freeman draws a salary of $200,008. Johnson tried to limit it to no more than the salary that Gov. Gray Davis is authorized to get -$175,000. "Many of us feel Mr. Freeman ripped off taxpayers of California so the (Los Angeles) Department of Water and Power could pay off its debts early," Johnson said. The amendments failed.
--Shares of PG&E Corp. fall 20 cents to close at $16.30. Shares of Edison International fall 7 cents to close at $13.60. Sempra Energy, parent company of San Diego Gas and Electric, rose 9 cents to close at $27.50.
--No power alerts Thursday as electricity reserves remain above 7%.
WHAT'S NEXT:
--State power regulators have announced a meeting Sept. 13, when they are expected to vote on issues that will affect California electric bills, including:
A proposal to grant the state's power-buying agency the authority to raise electric rates on its own without PUC review to ensure such rates are justified;
A proposal to raise rates for San Diego Gas and Electric Co. residential customers by an average of 12 percent;
A proposal that bills Pacific Gas and Electric Co. $6.5 billion, Southern California Edison Co. $4 billion and SDG&E $1.5 billion to help the state recoup its power-buying costs;
And the suspension of consumers' choice to switch from a local utility to a competing power marketer.
THE PROBLEM:
--High demand, high wholesale energy costs, transmission glitches and a tight supply worsened by scarce hydroelectric power in the Northwest and maintenance at aging California power plants are all factors in California 's electricity crisis.
--Southern California Edison and Pacific Gas and Electric say they've lost nearly $14 billion since June 2000 to high wholesale prices the state's electricity deregulation law bars them from passing on to consumers. PG&E, saying it hasn't received the help it needs from regulators or state lawmakers, filed for federal bankruptcy protection April 6. Electricity and natural gas suppliers, scared off by the companies' poor credit ratings, are refusing to sell to them, leading the state in January to start buying power for the utilities' nearly 9 million residential and business customers. The state is also buying power for a third investor-owned utility, San Diego Gas & Electric, which is in better financial shape than much larger Edison and PG&E but is also struggling with high wholesale power costs.
--The Public Utilities Commission has approved average rate increases of 37% for the heaviest residential customers and 38% for commercial customers, and hikes of up to 49% for industrial customers and 15% or 20% for agricultural customers to help finance the state's multibillion-dollar power buys.
California 's Plan for $12.5 Billion of Bonds to Cover Electricity Costs Runs Into Snags
09/07/2001
Dow Jones Business News
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)
California 's plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of bonds to cover extraordinary electricity costs is hitting snags that could delay the record debt issuance well into next year, forcing the state to issue more short-term paper than expected to cover a financing gap, Friday's Wall Street Journal reported.
The bond issuance is contingent on the state's being able to ensure a secure revenue stream from electricity sales so it can both pay power suppliers and cover interest payments on the planned bonds. But this week the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., San Francisco, said it would go to court rather than pay $500 million more for electricity procured by the state than the utility believes is its rightful share.
Pacific Gas, which earlier this year sought bankruptcy-court protection, objects to a proposed order by the California Public Utilities Commission to place 54% of the power costs incurred by the California Department of Water Resources on PG&E customers. The department began procuring power on behalf of cash-strapped utilities in January after wholesale-power prices in California surged to unprecedented levels.
According to the draft order, due to be voted on by the commission later this month, the state plans to charge PG&E for power obtained in the northern part of the state. Critics say this ignores the fact that the tally of costs has to do more with where power plants are located than it does with where electricity is consumed. Energy is shifted around the state through a high-voltage transmission system.
The upshot would be that PG&E customers would pay the department 14 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity . By contrast, customers of No. 2 utility Southern California Edison Co., a unit of Edison International, Rosemead, Calif., would pay 10 cents a kilowatt hour. SoCal Edison also has been financially weakened by California 's energy crisis, and is awaiting passage of a bill in the state legislature that would give it cash in exchange for its transmission and other assets.

California 's PUC Approves Some Agreements, But All is Not Go on Power Sale

SAN FRANCISCO -- The California Public Utilities Commission yesterday narrowly approved three utility servicing agreements that need to be in place before the state Department of Water Resources can begin its planned October sale of $12.5 billion in power purchase revenue bonds.
Commissioners postponed voting on the controversial issue of suspending ratepayer choice enacted as part of the state's deregulated power market. Suspending a utility customer's ability to seek electricity from sources outside the utility is seen as a crucial element for the bond sale, because it will ensure the number of customers whose rate payments will secure the bonds.
The five-member commission now plans to vote Thursday on that and other topics postponed earlier this week, including agreeing to cover DWR's revenue needs in retail rates and approving the rate agreement -- the contract giving the DWR rate-making authority to cover its costs until the bonds have been repaid. The commission also will vote on raising rates for San Diego Gas & Electric customers.
State Treasurer Philip Angelides warned late Wednesday afternoon that "the state of California cannot move forward to market and sell the bonds" until the commission takes the required actions.
Angelides said in a statement that his office will release a revised timetable for bond issuance only after the PUC has acted on all the items, indicating that the deal could possibly be postponed again if the PUC continues to delay voting on critical matters.
The servicing agreements approved yesterday are the contracts that spell out that Pacific Gas & Electric Co., Southern California Edison, and San Diego Gas & Electric will act as billing and collection agents for the DWR, will distribute the power DWR buys for its customers, and will each maintain a separate fund for revenues to remit to DWR.
Dissenting commissioners Richard Bilas and Henry Duque opposed the agreements because the portion of rates for the DWR will not be a separate item on customers' bills. Like some consumer groups and utilities, the commissioners are concerned that DWR has too much power since it became authorized to buy electricity for the state under Assembly Bill 1X.
"People should know that the rate increases are for DWR, but the utilities are taking the heat ... since DWR began spending, in effect, like a drunken sailor," Bilas said. "This approval of the agreements will display to the financial community that we are moving forward on AB 1X, but I think AB 1X was a mistake."
Duque expressed his hopes for passage of a Senate bill currently under consideration that would show the DWR set-aside on customer's utility bills. The bill, if approved, would set aside part of existing consumer electricity rates to guarantee the state has enough money to pay off bonds issued by the DWR but subject other expenses to review by the PUC. The bill, sponsored by Sen. John Burton, D-San Francisco, reportedly passed a key Assembly committee yesterday.
When AB 1X became law in February, Angelides had expected the bonds to sell in May. Until earlier this week, the treasurer had planned to begin issuing bonds in late October.
After the PUC acts, there is a one- to two-month appeal period.
Commissioner Carl Wood expressed concern that the commission was taking so long to end ratepayer choice.
"We're being negligent in failing to respond to this threat not only to the viability of the state bond issue but to basic fairness," Wood said. "The longer we drag this out, the more damage that is done."
However, delays to address the complex issues prior to selling the bonds will help ensure a more successful bond sale, according to David Blair, a senior analyst at Nuveen Advisory Corp.
"It's encouraging to see the state being very diligent and addressing issues before the bonds come out," he said. "The various delays and complications certainly make me more careful in evaluating it ... but it underscores the importance of having a structure that is rock solid and protected by law."
Good Omens for Calif. Gos

SAN FRANCISCO -- California 's $500 million general obligation sale Tuesday should meet strong demand despite uncertainties surrounding the long-delayed $12.5 billion power bond deal still hanging in the wings, investors said.
The GO deal is expected to do well because investors continue to seek alternatives to the equity markets and because prices for outstanding California GOs have rebounded following a sell-off earlier this year at the height of the state's energy crisis.
"Because of the lack of supply in California , the deal should do really well regardless of uncertainty around the power deal," said Dan Solender, California fund manager for Vanguard Group Inc. "The state's GO bonds are still considered a good credit. There hasn't been a large new issue in California in the last few weeks, so it's a great time to bring in a new deal."
The bonds, to be sold in 14 separate series under 12 bond acts authorized by state voters over the years, will be priced competitively. More than $300 million of the proceeds will be used to fund school facility improvements. Insurance can be obtained at the option of the bidders.
Vanguard was one of many funds that sold California bonds earlier in the year because of uncertainty surrounding the state's credit rating, but "we started buying them back around the June GO deal when spreads really widened, so they were really attractive to buy," Solender said.
Spreads have since tightened because the energy crisis seems to have died down, he said.
When California sold GOs last June it was forced to pay 25 basis points above the triple-A scale on bonds due in 30 years, but the sale was considered a success because some had feared the state would have to pay as much as 30 basis points more to sell the bonds. The sale came on the heels of downgrades by Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's. Standard & Poor's in April cut the state to A-plus from AA. In May, Moody's downgraded the state to Aa3 from Aa2.
Yield spreads on bonds due in 30 years tightened to 8 basis points above the triple-A scale in the secondary market on Wednesday as California experienced fewer rolling blackouts this summer than expected, and after wholesale power prices declined because of federal mitigation and the state's negotiation of long-term contracts that allowed it to avoid buying so much power at high market prices. Nevertheless, ratings analysts still assign the state a negative outlook.
"It seems the situation has improved, even if the state hasn't gotten the power deal done," Solender said.
Even though the short-term outlook has brightened, California still has to find a way to complete the Department of Water Resources' $12.5 billion revenue bond sale, Solender said.
The state needs to sell those bonds in order to obtain funds to reimburse itself for more than $6 billion it has spent this year to purchase power on behalf of the state's crippled utilities and to have cash on hand to finance more power purchases. But the deal -- which would be the largest municipal bond offering in history -- has been delayed several times because of the complexities of putting such a massive debt offering together.
"We all expected ups and downs through the whole process, but there are still a lot of questions to get answered," Solender said. "We all expect the state to get it done, otherwise it would be hurting the trading value" on GO bonds.
As much as the state may try to detach the power bonds from more normal financing plans, investors are looking at both, another investment analyst said.
David Blair, senior analyst at Nuveen Advisory Corp., said the two issues are connected because, even though the general fund is no longer being used to fund power purchases, California needs the power bond proceeds to replenish it.
"In looking at the state's outlook, you have to look at some of the risks it faces in resolving the power crisis. While there's a general expectation in the market that the power bond deal will get done, it's not guaranteed, so people are keeping their eye on the developments," Blair said.
While officials continue piecing together the power bond deal, the state's general fund should not need to loan more to the Water Resources Department, even if power bonds are not issued this fiscal year, according to official documents for the GO sale. The department also has sufficient funds available to purchase power for the rest of the fiscal year. As of mid-August, about $1.9 billion in the department's power-purchase fund had not yet been committed.
The state expects to maintain adequate cash reserves for the fiscal year even if the department cannot sell the bonds and repay the $6.3 billion in loans it owes the general fund, according to official documents. Officials also said none of the litigation regarding the energy situation seeks a judgment against the general fund.
California plans to issue $5.7 billion in revenue anticipation notes on Thursday to meet cash-flow needs.
"The Ran deal gives the state a little more flexibility, so things aren't as dire as they looked several months ago," Blair said.
But completing the power bond sale is crucial to California 's financial health, according to Blair, because the state's cash balances at the end of fiscal 2002 will be much lower without the $6 billion expected from the power bonds.
Blair noted that the October sale date for the power bonds was looking less likely given this week's postponement by the Public Utilities Commission of rulings needed to sell the bonds, including a vote on a rate agreement that would provide the revenue to repay the debt.
Still, the energy crisis has stabilized in the past several months, allowing the California bond market to strengthen, especially in the retail sector, he said.
"People are running for shelter from the equity market," he said.
Fitch affirmed its AA rating on the new issue and the state's $23.6 billion in outstanding GO debt, which has been on Rating Watch Negative since April.
The negative watch reflects continued uncertainties about the state's power-purchase program and billions of dollars in outstanding loans to the department. Financial risk to the general fund will continue until it is reimbursed, Fitch analysts said.
Additionally, state revenue estimates were lowered in May, largely due to volatile capital gains and personal income tax receipts. But in July, the first month of the fiscal year, revenues were 4.7% over estimates, though the California economy is evidently slowing.
The state expects to end the year with a general-fund balance of $3.4 billion, Fitch said.
On Wednesday, Standard & Poor's assigned its highest note rating to the state's Ran offering and affirmed its A-plus rating with a negative outlook on the GOs. The rating reflects the potential for additional general-fund purchases if the current power bond plan falls through and electricity prices rise, the possible long-term detrimental effect on the state's economy of retail electric rate hikes, and possible further rate increases to recapitalize the state's insolvent investor-owned utilities.
However, analysts said California 's economy remains strong and diversified and continues to grow. Projected fund balances are adequate --assuming reimbursement of the general fund with power bond proceeds.
Moody's was expected to release its rating report on the GOs today.
Public Resources Advisory Group serves as the state's financial adviser on the GO deal. Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe is bond counsel, the Law Office of Pamela S. Jue is co-bond counsel, and Quateman & Zidell is disclosure counsel.
California 's Plan for $12.5 Billion of Bonds
To Cover Electricity Costs Runs Into Snags

California 's plan to sell $12.5 billion worth of bonds to cover extraordinary electricity costs is hitting snags that could delay the record debt issuance well into next year, forcing the state to issue more short-term paper than expected to cover a financing gap.
The bond issuance is contingent on the state's being able to ensure a secure revenue stream from electricity sales so it can both pay power suppliers and cover interest payments on the planned bonds. But this week the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas & Electric Co., a unit of PG&E Corp., San Francisco, said it would go to court rather than pay $500 million more for electricity procured by the state than the utility believes is its rightful share.

Energy is shifted around the state through a high-voltage transmission system.
The upshot would be that PG&E customers would pay the department 14 cents a kilowatt hour for electricity . By contrast, customers of No. 2 utility Southern California Edison Co., a unit of Edison International, Rosemead, Calif., would pay 10 cents a kilowatt hour. SoCal Edison also has been financially weakened by California 's energy crisis, and is awaiting passage of a bill in the state legislature that would give it cash in exchange for its transmission and other assets.
"There is nothing on God's green Earth that can justify that differential," PG&E Senior Vice President Dan Richard said.
Anticipating a possible delay to the bond issue, the state is planning to issue $5.7 billion worth of revenue anticipation notes, or RANs, on Sept. 25. RANs are a financing tool routinely used to smooth out cash-flow imbalances caused by the occasionally jerky flow of tax receipts. In this case, though, the money is being collected to tide the state over until the power bonds can be issued.
In June, California borrowed $4.3 billion from banks to augment the roughly $8 billion it has borrowed from the state's general fund for power purchases. State Treasurer Philip Angelides said this week that once the RANs are issued, the state will have enough money to cover its power costs until the middle of next year. However, a delay in issuing bonds would in turn postpone repayment of the bank debt, whose interest rate steps up over time.
Until now, the state's timetable for issuing bonds has assumed that all legal challenges to about half a dozen funding-related orders expected to be issued by the public-utilities commission would be completed in October. Mr. Angelides said he hopes the state still can issue bonds in November but acknowledges "it's subject to change as events unfold."
USA: Calif. Assembly passes SoCal Edison rescue bill.

SACRAMENTO, Calif., Sept 7 (Reuters) - The California Assembly on Thursday passed a bill designed to save utility Southern California Edison (SCE) from bankruptcy and it now moves to the state Senate where it faces potentially its toughest hurdle.
The bill, based on a memorandum of understanding between Calif. Gov. Gray Davis and the utility in April, passed on a 41-32 vote. Under Assembly rules it had needed to secure at least 41 votes to pass the 80-member chamber.
It would allow the company to recover about $2.9 billion of the estimated $3.9 billion debt it incurred buying power for its customers at skyrocketing wholesale prices last year.
Consumer groups have been leading the campaign against the bill which they consider a bail-out at the expense of the utility's ratepayers.
The bill originated in the state Senate but has been extensively amended by Assembly committees and the current version is much more favorable to the utility than the one cleared by the Senate in a tight 22-17 vote last month.
Davis has been lobbying intensively for the bill but several leading lawmakers, including Senate leader John Burton, have indicated the revised version will face an uphill task winning sufficient support when it returns to the Senate for concurrence on Assembly amendments.
SCE, a unit of Edison International , was prohibited from passing on its higher costs due to a retail price freeze imposed under the state's power deregulation legislation.
The bill would allow the utility, California's second largest, to recover the $2.9 billion through a bond issue that would be repaid by a mandatory charge on business customers.
The state's largest utility, PG&E Corp. unit Pacific Gas & Electric, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in April after failing to agree on a salvage plan with Davis and his negotiating team.
California took over purchasing power for customers of the utilities in January as plunging credit ratings made it impossible for them to buy power in the wholesale market.
The state has been seeking to make SCE creditworthy again so it can resume purchasing power on behalf of its customers.
SCE, based in Rosemead, Calif., has some 11 million customers while San Francisco-based Pacific Gas & Electric has around 13 million.
Enron must give documents to Calif. lawmakers-judge.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Enron Corp. must turn over sensitive financial documents to a state Senate committee probing charges of price gouging during the state's energy crisis, a California judge ruled on Thursday.
But Sacramento Superior Court Judge Charles Kobayashi also ruled lawmakers must provide Enron with a confidentiality agreement, saying he was not convinced the committee would respect the firm's right to maintain proprietary secrets.
"If the committee could take the requested action in the name of the public interest, then the committee ostensibly could require newspapers to surrender their confidentiality rights, attorneys to surrender their attorney-client privilege, (and) psychiatrists to surrender their privileges," the judge wrote.
The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Market Manipulation has subpoenaed documents from a number of energy firms to probe accusations California power agencies and utilities were overcharged some $8.9 billion for wholesale electricity during the state's energy crisis which saw power prices in the state soar tenfold.
Independent energy merchants have blamed the price spike on the state's poorly designed electricity deregulation law and a failure to build enough power plants to meet the growing needs of its 34 million residents and its industries.
An Enron spokeswoman said on Thursday the firm has already turned over tens of thousands of documents, but wanted assurances that certain sensitive documents containing proprietary trade secrets, for example, would be protected under a confidentiality agreement.
The firm will now work with the committee to hammer out the specifics of such an agreement, said Enron spokeswoman Karen Denne.
"We are pleased with the judge's order in that he agreed that our constitutional right would be protected," Denne said. "The issue has always been protecting the confidential documents."
The committee has already asked the full Senate to cite Enron as well as Reliant Energy Inc. for contempt for failing to comply with a subpoena seeking confidential documents. It would be the first such citation imposed by the state Senate since 1929, but has not yet come up for a vote.
Atlanta-based Mirant Corp. however, avoided the contempt threat by agreeing with legislators' demands to sign confidentiality agreements, open a document depository close to Sacramento, and begin placing documents there relating to the company's recent business in California.
USA: Calif. moves key vote on power choice to Sept 13.
09/06/2001
Reuters English News Service
(C) Reuters Limited 2001.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 6 (Reuters) - The California Public Utilities Commission on Thursday delayed again a vote to suspend retail power choice, one of the cornerstones of the state's 1996 electricity deregulation law.
Loretta Lynch, president of the CPUC, said a vote on a proposed order to suspend retail customers' right to select their power supplier was delayed until a special meeting on Sept. 13.
That meeting's agenda will also include several items that establish the legal framework for the state to move ahead with a record sale of $12.5 billion in power purchase bonds.
The regulators have delayed votes on both issues since early this year while they have held hearings and prepared the complex measures needed to get the bond issue under way.
Retail choice - also called direct access - gives electricity users the right to pick their power provider, bypassing the local utility in the search for the most competitively priced energy.
The option was built into California's deregulation scheme, but almost all residential and small business customers ignored it and stuck with their local utility to provide "bundled" energy services.
CPUC Commissioner Carl Wood said that despite "populist rhetoric" about retail choice in the deregulation law, big businesses demanded that the option be included so they could switch power suppliers and "avoid paying their share" of past debts incurred by the utilities.
When power shortages sent wholesale power prices soaring last year, independent power suppliers "dumped their customers back on the utilities," Wood said.
"Now, when some order has been restored to the market and the high prices have come down, suddenly direct access looks viable again.... It's a Gold Rush," he added.
State officials fear that keeping the direct access option in place offers industrial customers a way to buy power from new suppliers and dodge paying for the emergency power supplies already purchased by California's Department of Water Resources.
The water agency has spent more than $7 billion to buy power for the state's financially troubled utilities - PG&E Corp.'s Pacific Gas & Electric and Edison International's Southern California Edison.
The PG&E utility is bankrupt, and Gov. Gray Davis is scrambling to get the legislature to approve a $2.9 billion rescue plan for Southern California Edison.
The two utilities ran out of money buying power in the state's volatile electricity market. The deregulation law blocked them from passing their power costs to consumers.
State Treasurer Phil Angelides wants to take the bonds to market by late October so the state can begin to recover the money spent buying electricity.

2 Elec Profits Tax Bills On The Move In Calif Assembly
By Jessica Berthold

09/06/2001
Dow Jones Energy Service
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)

OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES



LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--The California Assembly is to consider a bill Friday to place a progressive tax on electricity sales in California , the second windfall profits tax measure to be heard by legislators in a week.

Under Assembly Bill 2XX, introduced by Assemblywoman Ellen Corbett, D-San Leandro, generators wouldn't be taxed on power priced below $60 per megawatt-hour. Prices above $60/MWh would be subject to a gradually increasing tax.

The first $30 charged by suppliers over the $60/MWh baseline would be taxed at a 50% rate. The next $30 would be taxed at 70%. Anything higher would be taxed at 90%.

The tax would be retroactive to Jan. 1, 2001 and effective through 2005. Tax proceeds would be used to fund a state sales tax holiday on the first weekend in December. Alternative energy suppliers, or "qualifying facilities," as well as self-generators, would be exempt from the tax.

Any excess receipts after the sales tax holiday would be used to provide tax credits to companies for building new generation.

"AB 2XX will help Californians recoup and regain financial footing in an economy that is changing very quickly," said Corbett. "This measure is a major step for California 's recovery from this year's disastrous energy crisis."

If the bill passes the Assembly floor, it will move to the Senate for committee and floor votes. The legislature is set to adjourn Sept. 14.

Similar Bill On Assembly Floor Monday

A second windfall profits tax bill is likely to be heard on the Assembly floor Monday, said a spokesman for the bill's sponsor, Sen. Nell Soto, D-Ontario. The bill passed out of the Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday.

The bill, SB 2XX, would require state regulators to establish a cost-based price for electricity for each plant in the state. Sellers would be taxed 100% on any sales from a plant that exceeded its cost-based price, and the money would be used for taxpayer rebates. The cost-based price would include up to a 20% return on invested capital.

The tax, which would be effective retroactively to Jan. 1, 2001, would apply to the last sale before electricity hits the power grid, and so would include marketers as well as generators. Co-generation facilities and renewable generators would be exempt, as would some state municipal utilities.

The bill has a good chance of passing the Assembly floor, since only a majority vote is required and Democrats dominate the Assembly 50-30, said Soto spokesman Paul Van Dyke. Thus far, the bill has passed the Senate and various committees in the Assembly on strict party lines.

If the bill does pass the Assembly floor, it would go back to the Senate for concurrence, and then to the governor's desk to be signed. Van Dyke said he did not know which windfall profits tax bill was more likely to pass out of both houses before the legislature adjourns, nor whether the two might be cobbled together to form one bill.

"Our bill is two steps from going to the governor; the other bill has a ways to go," Van Dyke said. "Sometimes two bills on the same issue will pass and go all the way to the governor, and it's up to him to choose."

A spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis said last week that he was open to a windfall profits tax bill, but would not indicate which bill he might prefer.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I am attaching the latest draft of the captioned stipulation which I received from Rick Roberts, counsel for ISO.  As you are aware, the stipulation is the next item to attend to in the CA proceeding, given that Judge Birchman gave us a week from last Wednesday to agree on the text of the stipulation.  The Judge considers it important to limit the scope of the proceeding to only those matters that should be before him.  Therefore, in the absence of agreement, he will hear oral argument on the morning of 9/17 and decide the matter for himself.

The current draft is pretty well down the road between the ISO and generators.  Although the draft appears to be "harmless", dealing with "settlement disputes", it has the purpose of limiting the scope of the proceeding.  I was therefore concerned with the vagueness of it and the possibility it could be interpreted in such a way as to limit our ability to bring offsetting claims in conjunction with the "Finding 3" that the Judge must make in the proceeding.  My concern is that almost anything could be couched in terms of a "settlement dispute".  My fears were confirmed when I talked to Rick Roberts and asked him how he interpreted the language.  Roberts sees it as excluding from the proceeding, 3 types of disputes:

1.	disputes under the ISO and PX tariffs, whether already resolved, unresolved or not yet raised
2.	disputes pending resolution before the Commission
3.	disputes ongoing over existing orders issued by the Commission

I consider this a pretty broad interpretation, but that's how he sees it nonetheless.  Roberts gave as an example of what would be out of the proceeding, pursuant to the draft, the "$150 breakpoint" issue.  I don't have a problem with the breakpoint issue being excluded since the Judge already ruled that it should be "out".  However, if this is Roberts' interpretation, then the problem is that he would also likely consider the ISO underscheduling penalty to be pending before, or not finally resolved by, the Commission.  This interpretation would foreclose our ability to bring, in the CA refund proceeding, the offset for amounts due us under the underscheduling penalty.  It would relegate us to chasing our money in a different proceeding.  This would be unacceptable.  What other possible offsets could he try to interpret out of the proceeding?

I am writing this to raise the "red flag" as to this important issue.  Dan, we will need your immediate attention and input on drafting/negotiating this stipulation.  I would expect that conference calls could be called as early as today, given that there are only 5 days left to agree the text of the stipulation.  I am available to discuss this today or over the weekend on my cell.  Thanks.  Ray

This ought to be very interesting!!

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index
published : August 24, 2001
FERC's Wood Looking for a Few Good Executives
Chairman designate Pat Wood III is looking for a few good energy executives to teach him and his FERC colleagues the ins and outs of the natural gas and electricity markets, specifically how to detect when something "smelly" is taking place.
He's willing to pay a maximum salary of $133,700 -- which is what he'll be making as chairman -- for up to 10 executives who are interested in the task. That's the "top payment" that Congress will allow, Wood noted. He's also looking to hire an unspecified number of executives at a salary in the $115,000 range. Potential applicants should call him directly at (202) 208-0388, Wood said during an interview with NGI Thursday.
"We've tried like crazy to get people. We can't compete on dollars...Government never competes on dollars. You got to get people who believe in this thing. There are people who want to do...something good for the [public]. I'm going to find those people," he noted, adding that this was a top priority with him.
For interested executives, Wood said, "I'm going to give you the top [salary] I can pay you in the U.S. government, and I'm going to give you a helluva great workload in a critical industry that everybody in America depends on."
He wants the executives to show him and the other four Commissioners "how it works." For example, "hedging and derivatives are great words" that are often tossed around, but Wood would like to know exactly how they work. "All five of us need to know everything about this business."
Wood acknowledged that the new Market Observation Resource Center, which enables FERC to monitor the markets on a real-time basis throughout the day, has been a great addition at the Commission, but he says the agency needs people to decipher the data that it generates. "Getting the data is one thing, but having somebody that can assimilate that into something that tells you a story" is what FERC needs.
He firmly believes that reported incidents of price manipulation and other market-power abuses will drop as the Commission's knowledge of the markets grows. "As we get smart on this, they won't try this stuff," Wood said, adding that it will "let them know [that] we're watching."
Still, he admits that spotting price manipulation won't be easy for the Commission. "I think it's hard...even if you're really good at it."

Ok, but make sure the documentation of the email follows the invoice for the payment, otherwise we will have to go back to him to appriove the payment.

Sean,

Elizabeth should be familiar with what I will be refering to in this note, so please reference her if need be...

There are several ENA sales for Sep-01 production to Coral Energy Canada, Inc. which the counterparty is claiming should be billed under Coral Canada US, Inc.  The counterparty will not pay on these items until corrected.  In fact, the counterparty faxed back our confirmation with the requested change back in September.  Ann (I don't know eher last name) with ENA physical confirmations said that she was aware of these confirmations and that they had been forwarded to Elizabeth for her attention.  It is my understanding that once noted that there was actually no counterparty in our systems under this new name, the traders for each company should have been in contact to straighten this out.  I am unaware of that occuring or even if that is the correct procedure.

I am cc'ing Vladi Pimenov because Sitara shows him as having created at least one of the deals.  Maybe he can clarify things for us.  One example of such deals is 1026087.  Bottom line is I need a way of receiving payment from Coral on these items.

Gentlemen,

As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Kim Ward
Manager, West Gas Origination

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


After trying most of the week to reach John Sommer at Oneok, I received two calls this morning, one from Kevin Willt (Bushton Plant) and the other from Steve Winston regarding the Bushton measurment issues.  Kevin just wanted to let me know that he would be their measurement contact for day to day operations issues at the Bushton plant and wanted the phone number for Kenneth Cessac.  He said he would be getting with Kenneth about the April/May differences between metered volumes and PTR and would be working with Kenneth going foward on the day to day measurement issues.

Steve Winston wanted to discuss a number of issues.  Here's how that discussion went.  This may be far more detail than anyone wants but since I'm just jumping into this I want to make sure everyone knows what's taking place.  If you want far less detail going foward, please let me know.

Steve asked what our plan was.  I told him that we were waiting for their technical expert to get with Ken Cessac to look at the April/May differences (this was based on Ken's call to John Sommer last week) and that I had been trying to get with John Sommer to set up a meeting as a follow-up to his discussions with Phil to talk about their concerns and need for further clarification to the Measurement Agreement.  Steve informed me that John Sommer would no longer be in the picture as a result of recent org changes and that we should work with he and Terry Spencer.

He stated that Blaine Bender, their Kansas Operstions Manager, and Kevin Willt, their Bushton plant measurement person are supposed to be getting with Ken Cessac to look at the April/May differences.  I told him that I had just talked to Kevin.  They have hired Steve Stark as their technical expert/consultant to work on this.  He stated that the arbitration hearing had "given us a clean slate" and that the metered volume/PTR comparisons in June, July and August looked pretty good with both sides of the plant running but that April and May were a still a concern to them.  They're desire is to look into it and "let the science prevail" on these months.  I told him that our position, based on the arbitration decision, was pretty clear, that being that our metered volumes prevail, a comparison is really indifferent.  He did not respond all that well to this statement and said that we both have to work together on this issue going forward.  I told him that we would certainly work with them to look at the April and May differences and that if that look/see showed anything we would certainly consider it but reemphasized that the measurment agreement is the basis for our business decisions.

He then wanted to know what needed to be done from the standpoint of the measurement agreement.  I told him that we were open to listening to their concerns and if we needed to get together for a meeting, that we could get one set up.  I asked if he could share some of his thoughts on what they were thinking.  Here's a bullet list of some of the things he brought up.

They want to build a relationship with us where both sides openly share their measurement data and information as is relates to metered volumes and PTR.

They have no long term confidence in the ultrasonic measurement without a comparison to PTR.  He also brought up the issue of two phase flow as temperatures begin to cool this fall and condensate starts come up the pipe.

They propose that the agreement be redone in such a way that it is more "self correcting" and that compares the metered volumes to PTR.  And as long as this comparison falls within certain tolerances, then there would be no adjustments.  While he didn't want to commit to a tolerance, he did give a "Steve Winston opinion" of around 1%.  He described the process as a "self correcting" process. Not real clear what that means.

He also stated that they would want to define a level of exceedance that would require a joint investigation of the problem and defined resolution process.

I asked if as a starting point, he would generate a list of their proposed change provisions and send that to me.  He said he was already working on it, he called it "Bushton PTR Measurement Settlement" and would get a bullet list to me in the next couple of days that we could start looking at.  We agreed that we would start from here and then see where it takes us.

Hi Chris,

Here is a briefing from my phone conversation with Mike Kim regarding the
usage reports.  Mike will give us more details when he gets back on Tuesday.


California Usage Extract

MDA 2.1 is the new meter database which contains extracted information from
the Cheop System, CSC system and updated position.

Mike may have data from 1999-2000 and will be contacting us with this
information on Tuesday 9/11.   Per Mike, the 98-99 deals have no specified
baseline, they must be taken at face value.

National Usage Extract (i.e. Arch Diocese of Chicago, MultiFiber Glass)

The National Usage data is extracted from the Fazer Database


Also, I left Dennis a message regarding the 80-85% of the Discount Frozen
Tariff vs the18,000 power deals in RPS.  I have not heard from him yet.

Thanks,

Annie

Mark--one of my colleagues, Bob Frank, is going to be attending the hearing on Thursday morning at the Colorado PUC on my behalf.  Bob has as strong background in regulatory proceedings and will be able to expand on our comments before the Commission if given the ability to present.  (As we had talked about previously, it is very possible the the Commissioners will ask interested parties if they would like to speak---this is a tad less formal than evidentiary proceedings).

I suggested to Bob that you might want to go to the hearing with him since you are officed in Denver and have an interest in the issue.  I'll give you a call on Monday and we'll see what's up in terms of coordinating.  In the meantime, Bob's phone number is  713-853-3180.


Bob--there is a Westin at Tabor Center that is just across the street from Mark's office.  The Commission is about 10-12 blocks away, but I don't think there are any hotels that are effectively any more convenient than this one.

Sixth Interstate Natural Gas Facility-Planning Seminar
"Presentation of Staff's Findings"
October 26, 2001
Washington, DC

Link to "Ideas" document:  http://www.ferc.gov/gas/stakeholder.pdf
_ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _

Comments due on pre-filing stakeholder "Ideas" document November 9
Overriding theme to all Action Ideas is "earlier is better"
Pre-filing process has a new docket prefix (PF) and is underway; explained in some detail
Staff seems to be looking for best practices, possibly even a vehicle for industry-wide (and public) sharing

Highlights

Though FERC's Office of Energy Projects intends to hold more public and industry outreach seminars, this sixth seminar was the last of this series; OEP presented their final draft of "Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement in the Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Planning Pre-Filing Process: Industry, Agencies, Citizens and FERC Staff."

Following this presentation, there is one last round of comments on the document due to the Outreach Team by November 9th.  The Outreach Team's goal is to release a final document by the end of this year.  Overall, the Team wants to know if they're findings are on target, and they have asked for comments that include edits, additions or omissions.  To note, however, is that "The Ideas" is seen as a "living document" by OEP, and it will be changed and updated on an ongoing basis as better practices and ideas emerge.  Again Rich Hoffmann stated that there is no intention for any of this to be included in a rulemaking or policy statement (I believed him this time).   Also, Rich clarified that "we recognize these ideas have to be customized for every project."  [This is, in fact, why the document was not issued as "guidelines" -- industry argued they would become de facto requirements.]

For comment on the document itself, we will look for ETS recommendations from interested groups (there is a link to the document above).  At the end of this memo, there is also a list of general questions from the Outreach Team.  Please send replies or comments on those questions, as well as the "Ideas" document, to me by November 7th for aggregation and inclusion in informal comments to go to the Outreach team (comments will not be filed with the Secretary).

FERC Staff Presentation

The Gas Outreach Team (Rich Hoffmann, Lauren O'Donnell, Jeff Shenot, Howard Wheeler) presented their findings of Action Options for the four major stakeholder sectors: Pipeline Industry, Agency (local, state and resource agencies), Citizen and FERC Staff.  There is a slide presentation that should be made available online soon.

There was some Q&A, but Staff was particularly eager to hear examples of how some of these ideas have been implemented successfully and if any "best practices" have emerged since the Outreach Team began these discussions.  One worry we have with Staff's preoccupation with best practices is that, at some point, they may want to formalize that idea though the publication of best practices.  They seem to be looking for a vehicle to collect and communicate best practices from pipeline company to pipeline company, and to the public.  Similar to the idea of publishing guidelines which then become de facto requirements, "best practices" can evolve into requirements as well, and such practices vary widely in use and effectiveness across different systems, projects and regions of the country.  Industry may want to protect the importance of variability and customization of approach based on what we know about certain regions and populations.

Some points of interest from the discussion include the emphasis by FERC Staff that pipeline companies appear to be most successful when they get full management support from the top at the very beginning of project development, there is a proactive company-wide philosophy, and the project team includes various parts of the company from the outset (i.e., include public affairs from the beginning as well as engineering, and have them communicate with each other regularly through the team).

NEPA Pre-Filing Process

Attesting to the emerging role of the NEPA Pre-filing Process, there is a new docket prefix, "PF," instituted to allow for public access to information on pre-filed projects.  This process is not an expedited approach that takes less time at FERC, but instead overlays the company's timeline with the FERC NEPA timeline in the development and assessment of the project.  This allows for a certificate sooner for the company in relation to their own project development process.  As an example, a NEPA Pre-Filing process could begin before the exact route has been determined, though the project must be well-defined -- while the company is holding public meetings and choosing the route, FERC could begin the scoping process.  According to OEP's assessment, this could shift the NEPA process back as much as seven months.  Under this scenario, once the company files for its certificate application, a final certificate could be issued in under ten months.

In order to use the pre-filing process, companies must meet certain qualifications.  First, a company should be prepared to fund a third party contractor to help FERC Staff prepare the certificate and NEPA requirements.  Also, there must be a real written commitment to identify and resolve issues.  And the company must be able to demonstrate that the other major NEPA organizations are prepared to cooperate on development of the NEPA assessment.  To qualify to use the NEPA pre-filing, the company files a formal request with the OEP Director answering any concerns FERC Staff may have about the project and the outlook for a successful pre-filing process.  Once accepted, that would trigger the PF docket assignment.  Currently, only the NiSource Greenbriar project is utilizing this process.


Follow-Up Questions from FERC

Along with any comments we may have on the "Ideas" document itself, FERC Staff distributed a set of three questions for consideration and/or comment from industry and the public.  The questions follow  -- note that Staff is particularly eager to collect positive anecdotes on how these ideas are already working on projects:

Part 1: Are we on target?  [Please let us know of any additions, omissions, or editorial changes you recommend for "Ideas for Better Stakeholder Involvement..."]
Part 2:  Ideas for implementation  [Please give us your good ideas about how to put the ideas discussed here today to work.  This can be for projects you are involved with or for other projects of which you are aware.]
Part 3: Examples of successful implementation [Please describe examples of how using these concepts helped make your experience or involvement with a project better.]

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an "Out Of Market" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market ("OOM") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and "the Friday Burrito," an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

"There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, "The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets."

John,
I have reviewed the contracts (Asset Agreement and the GPA) and here are my thoughts regarding your request.  In short, the agreements do not specifically address capacity being needed by third parties.  ENA does have a right to all of their capacity free and clear of all encumbrances.  Last year we did discuss this issue (the interruptible VNG customers wanting to take releases of VNG capacity), but at the time Jim Scabareti indicated that he was going to play hard ball with his interruptible shippers in year 2 (i.e. now), since VNG was really getting tight on assets due year-on-year load growth and no new capacity additions.  He gave the assets up last year because he did not want to have any noise at the VSCC when the VSCC was considering the affiliate relationship between VNG and AGLES.  However, as I reflect on it now, it seems to me that VNG (aka Sequent) really needs to weigh heavily the decision to release any assets to third parties through this winter (interruptible or otherwise).  At a minimum, any releases should be done recallable based on weather forecasts based on some HDD amount.  The profit sharing provision is the same for years 1 and 2.

My suggestion is that you do the following: (1) remind Sequent about the deliverability issue facing VNG and (2) develop a plan with Sequent for talking to Customers, so as to minimize any VSCC risk since the VSCC thinks Sequent is VNG's asset manager.

Mark Breese is back in the office tomorrow and I will confer with him as well.  You might seek Jeff Hodge's thoughts as well.  If you have any questions, please ask.
Regards,
Ed

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Everyone:
Here's the proposed letter to ONEOK regarding the Fisher Roc lock-up period of September 12-16.  I need and would greatly appreciate your immediate input as follows:
1.  Please provide any and all substantive and stylistic comments ASAP.  We have absolutely got to have the facts straight, so please don't assume that anyone will catch something that you see that is in error; let me know.  I would like to get this out this afternoon, as Gary Anderson's folks are already inputting the adjusted volumes/Btus that Ken Cessac formulated into the system, and ONEOK will receive that information shortly.  Again, kudos to Ken for his usual excellent job on this.
2.  We are missing an "an" in the first sentence, right before the word "incident"; that will be corrected.
3.  The letter has been set up for Ken Cessac's signature, but let us know if it should come from someone else.
4.  I have the spreadsheet that Ken will attach to the letter.  Using our numbers, the variance is a bit larger during the Fisher Roc outage period, than before or after, based on the Plant PTR numbers we have already been provided for that period (although we don't know if those numbers are final).  Before the outage period, for the month of September (so, September 1-part of  September 12), the average variance was about .5%.  During the outage period, before Ken's adjustment of our numbers (so, part of September 12 through part of September 16), the average variance was 8.2%.  Still staying within the outage period, after Ken's adjustment of our numbers (per the spreadsheet that will be attached to his letter), the average variance is 2.8%.  Since the Fisher Roc was fixed on September 16, we have no Plant PTR numbers, so we can't tell what the variance is yet.  I will separately e-mail a copy of the spreadsheet.
5.  Who at ONEOK should receive this letter?  Ken mentioned a new plant accounting-type named Jeff Knight who has provided him with figures.  We could always cc to other ONEOK representatives.  Maybe Kim Hardeman?
6.  As Grant suggested yesterday, and I agree, this letter will not prompt any agreement by ONEOK; in fact, we expect ONEOK to come back with a protest and a demand that we use PTR for this period.  We'll keep you advised.
Many thanks.

Rod,
Listed below is one of the items that I have been trying to get a hold of you
on.  The others can wait until you have a few minutes.
We have spent some time reviewing the allocation of our VaR and net open
position (NOP) trading limits and would like to make the following changes to
better match the limits and their objectives to our trading activity and
portfolio.
1.  VaR:  Given that we are a naturally short utility and do not hedge our
long-dated gas position for regulatory, liquidity and market view reasons we
would like to  reallocate $500k of our regulated electric VaR to our regulated
natural gas VaR bring the gas VaR up to $2.5MM and reducing the electric VaR
to $7.5mm.  This change is necessary to account for the size of our natural
short position in the back-end of our reporting period. After reducing our
electric VaR we will still have sufficient capacity to manage the regulated
electric portfolio.
2. NOP:  After changing our regulated gas VaR to $2.5MM it will be necessary
to change the corresponding net open position.  Currently we have been using a
10 Bcf limit for our NOP and Maturity Gap.  Using a $2.5MM VaR we recalculated
the corresponding NOP/Maturity limit to be approximately 17 Bcf.
I have reviewed these changes with Vlady and he has concurred with my proposed
changes.  In our conversation he recommended that in addition to reviewing
these changes with you that I also run them by Rick Buy.  It was my intent to
review these changes with you but I was surprised by having to review these
changes with Rick.  It was my understanding that once an allocation of VaR was
made to a business unit that it is within the business units preview to
reallocate that VaR as needed to met business unit objectives.  If the
business process has changed I will be glad to contact Rick and review these
changes with him.  Its your call so please let me know your preference.
Thanks.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I'm sorry for those of you on the email list for the first time, but my goal
yesterday was to get the word out and trust it would be passed along to
those people I missed.  So, to everyone who gets this, please forward to
anyone not included here that knows Richard Ernst.  Kristin apologizes for
not contacting many of you personally, but everything has happened so fast
there simply hasn't been time.

A recap for our newcomers:
Last Saturday, Richard began having sever headaches that were soon
accompanied by blurred vision.  He went to the hospital on Monday, and the
doctors diagnosed a brain aneurysm.  He had surgery on Monday night, and the
doctors discovered there was no aneurysm (blood clot) but rather
hemorrhaging.

The update:
Richard had an MRI last night, and the doctors found a tumor on the lower
back side of his brain, near the section where the brain meets the spinal
column.  It's about the size of a key lime, and apparently was causing the
hemorrhaging.  Although this is certainly not what anyone hoped to see in
the MRI, it is in a very operable location.  He is being treated now with
steroids to reduce the swelling, and remains on some heavy duty pain
killers, including morphine.

There is no immediate threat to his life, as the doctors said he could wait
as long as two weeks to have surgery, but Richard wants to get it done
sooner, so he is scheduled to under the knife again on Monday.  He is in a
lot of pain.  They won't know until the operation whether or not the tumor
is malignant.

He is in the ICU at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio (7700 Floyd Curl Dr)
and unable to accept flowers or gifts, but if you want to send something,
his home address is: 243 E. Elmview, SA, TX 78209.  Since the operation
isn't until Monday, the Ernst's are just killing time, and they welcome
visitors.  If anyone wants to come to San Antonio this weekend, they would
be happy to see you.

I just called and spoke to him, and he sounds pretty good.  He said the
nurses haven't been "poking or prodding" at him as much, so that has been
nice.  I am going to visit him this afternoon, so if anyone wants to send
him a message, email it to me before lunch, and I'll print it out and take
it to him personally.

That's all I can think of right now, and please forward this email.

Remember the Ernst family in your prayers.

John Shepperd

Casey,

Using one login ID, Bob can open two seperate Stack Manager windows on two PCs and set up different product filters on each for purposes of managing his different regions. The only drawback here is that whichever stack he closes last will save the product defaults and he will have to set up his seperate breakout for the other region each time he logs in (a proces that may take a minute or two depending on how many products he is managing).

To avoid this, we could set him up with a second Stack Manager ID and he could simply maintain two distinct stacks. If he would like a second Stack Manager ID, just let me know and I will forward the request to Stephanie Sever for setup.

Thanks,

Dear Richard,
As requested, please find hereinbelow the different sections of Law No. 25,188 of Public Ethics (PEL) and of our criminal code (CC) that could be in play in this matter.
Please notice that we have recently discovered through our criminal lawyer the unpublished opinion of the Anticorruption Office dlivered at the enquiry of the Secretary of Communications. Some of the ideas therein expressed could benefit Mr. X in case than a specific investigation or challenge is made. We will work in a memo to illustrate on the matter.
Section 13, PEL: It is incompatible with public office:
a) to manage, administer, represent, sponsor, provide any advise, or, by any other means, render services to any person that negotiates or has a concession or is a supplier of the State or performs activities regulated by the same, so long as the relevant public office position has a direct competence with respect to the engagement, achievement, negotiation or control of such concessions, benefits or activities;
b) to be a supplier, either on its behalf or on behalf of a third party, of any State body where the relevant person is an officer.
Section 15, PEL: If at the moment of his appointment, the public officer is held to be within any of the incompatibilities mentioned in Section 13, he must:
a) resign to such activities as a condition precedent to assuming the position.
b) refrain himself from intervening, during the performance of his duties as an officer, in matters related to the persons with whom or issues in which he were connected with for the past three (3) years or where he has a corporate participation.
In such circumstances, those acts could be considered null and void and generate the responsibility mentioned in section 17 of the abovementioned law that provides:
Section 17, PEL: Notwithstanding the rights of any third party acting in good faith, in the event that the acts performed by the persons comprised in Section 1 are within the scope of Sections 13, 14 and 15, the same shall be absolutely invalid and void. In case of the issuance of an administrative act, such acts shall be absolutely invalid and void pursuant to the terms of Section 14 of law No. 19,549.
The concession companies or other counter parties shall be severally liable for any damages caused to the State by these acts.
Section 173, CC:
Fraudulent administration
Notwithstanding the general provision of the above-mentioned Section, the following shall be considered special cases of fraud and shall be subject to the penalties established therein[prison of one month to six years]:
...7) who, due to any applicable law, authority or legal act, is in charge of the management, administration or care of assets or economic interests belonging to a third party, with the purpose of seeking on its behalf or on behalf of a third party an illegal profit or of causing damage, infringes the duty of care, damaging the entrusted interests or illegitimately forces the owner of the same;...
Section 256, CC:
Passive Corruption
The public officer who, on its behalf or through any third party, receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and perpetual disqualification to hold a public position.
Section 256 (bis), CC:
Influence peddling
Who, on its behalf or through any third party, asks for or receives money or any other grant or accepts a direct or indirect promise, in order to illegally influence a public officer so as to make the latter act, delay the performance or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office, shall be punished with confinement or prison from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position..
Section 258, CC:
Active Corruption
Who, direct or indirectly, grants or offers benefits seeking any of the behaviours referred in  articles 256 and 256 (bis), first paragraph, shall be punished with prison from one to six years. If the grant was made or offered to obtain any of the referred behaviours by articles 256 bis, second paragraph and 257, the punishment will be of prison from two to six years. If it was a public officer, he will be punished with special disqualification from two to six years in the first case and from three to ten years in the second one.
Section 258 (bis), CC:
Influence peddling
Who grants or offers to a public officer of another State, direct or indirectly, any  value or other benefits as donations, favours, promises or advantages, in order to illegally influence him so as to make, as exchange, the latter act or omit to act with respect to anything related to his office related to any transaction of economic or commercial nature, shall be punished with confinement from one to six years and life disqualification to hold a public position.
Section 268 (3), CC:
Affidavit Omission or Falsification
Who, under law and in view of its position, is required to file a patrimonial affidavit and maliciously omits to do so, shall be punished with prison from fifteen days to two years and perpetual disqualification.
The violation shall be deemed such when, upon sufficient notification demanding compliance, the relevant person fails to comply with the requested obligations within the terms foreseen by applicable laws.
The same penalty shall be applicable to anyone who maliciously falsifies or omits to include in the referred affidavits any data or information that is required to be included in accordance with any applicable law and regulations.
Do not hesitate in contacting us should you need any further clarificaction.

Jim
I met yesterday with  Alan Larson's staff at State to bring them up to date on where we are and urge further efforts by State Dept to get the Prime Minkister's office to engage in meaningful negotiations on Dabhol.  State at this point remains fully sympathetic to the position we are in and recognizes that a closer U.S.-Indian relationship long term must be built on a sound commercial relationship, which cannot exist so long as Dabhol remains unaddressed and unresolved.  To that end their word is that the commercial dialogue continues and continues as a priority.  Larson, Undersecretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, has been appointed USG Coordinator of the bilateral commercial relationship and a trip planned in November to go to India remains on at the behest of the Ambassador.   This could certainly change with the Afghan situation but this is the situation as of now.
The Ambassador is a critical player for us in terms of his daily interaction with Mishra and other senior Indian govt. officals.  We need to keep him up to speed and view him as a critical resource to pressure the PMO.  Particularly at this juncture, when India is working hard to make sure they are perceived by the USG to be at least as supportive as Pakistan to the US, a word from the Ambassador to the PM to get Dabhol off the table would be jolting. I would encourage Wade to try to meet with him and send the message that he has to step up the pressure to get the Indian side to seriously negotiate.  thanks John

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


US Treasury Sec'y O'Neill has been out in front this week as an administration voice trying to shape the parameters of the Hill debates (trying to keep the lid on some proposals that could have long-term costs for the budgets several years out).    It will continue to be a delicate balance, as the administration is looking to get a final bill by the end of next week and get money into pockets in time for the end of the year.
Fed Chair Greenspan could also critically affect the debate tomorrow in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee: his core belief is that whatever the precise stimulus number arrived at, it should be primarily temporary in character.  His preference under current conditions is for security and fiscal policy to be the response instruments in the face of the diminishing returns to and efficacy of further rate reductions in the face of uncertainty.

Competitive Analysis
HILL STIMULUS BILL UPDATE: 10/16/01
Partisanship is the Question for Senate Battle: Final Stimulus Bill Likely in the $80-110B Range, but Hill Dems' and Repubs' aims could push it northward
SUMMARY
Senate numbers look set to exceed Bush figures ($60-75B), may approach House Ways and Means $100B; final conferenced bill could hit $140B; all on this on top of the special $55B approved right after the attacks for airlines and immediate impact areas
Republican plan, so far, all tax cuts and no spending
Democratic plan has a lot more spending, but it is all on supporting people who have lost their jobs and none of it is on infrastructure
Final, conferenced bill may run as high as $140B if the 'neglected' middle-class is given another rebate check (up to another $38B)
One major question hanging over size, composition and speed of the Senate package is whether Senate Maj. Leader Daschle decides to move quickly toward a bipartisan Senate package that tries to isolate the House Republicans and their business tax cutting agenda
Daschle will present dilemma to President Bush and his senior advisers. "We will tell the president that we need assurance from the White House that compromises we make will be supported by the White House. If Bush can't give that assurance - unable to control the right - then we will probably opt for the more partisan position."
REPORT
The centrifugal pull of a big number like $100B proved the main attractor in early action on the stimulus front.  House Ways and Means Committee votes approved a tax cut package - mainly for businesses - that added up to just about exactly that number.  The Senate will produce something a little smaller, but the handwriting is on the wall as the two houses of Congress move toward a Conference Committee package that could easily top that total.
One key member of the Senate negotiations told sources late Sunday: "We are working on a package designed to stay with the principle that everything should be temporary and roll off after one year to avoid blowing through budget surpluses later.  Right now we are still aiming to stay in Bush's $60B to $75B bracket, but everyone knows the final number will go up from there."
Although Senate process is controlled by Democrats, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus (Dem) is in a highly contested re-election campaign next year in a deeply Republican state.  Just as he did with the earlier Bush tax cut plan, you can expect him to reach out to work with senior Republicans (such as Grassley) despite the wishes of more partisan members of the leadership.
Likely elements of the Democratic Senate package:
Rebates for those who pay payroll taxes but did not get the first $300 or $600 rebate. This was also in the House Republican package.
Temporary investment incentive for businesses - this could easily be 30% - but they will keep it to one year.
Some form of extending the loss-carryback for businesses and allowing one-year use of AMT credits in 2002. The loss-carryback is quite likely because of the relatively small 10-year costs. For Democrats AMT is more complicated. (see below)
Some form of expanded unemployment insurance incentive - not just extending the number of weeks, but other elements to expand who is eligible.
50% rebate for unemployed workers who pay for extended health care benefits through the COBRA program.
Partisanship Question:
There are a series of senior Democrats who argue that an early compromise could be a major mistake since House Republicans will simply "pocket the concessions we make toward Republican-style tax cutting and press on with their business tax cutting agenda during the conference committee." In other words, does Daschle position the Senate Democrats for the bipartisan high road after this bill is passed or does he position Democrats for the partisan wrangling that seems very likely all the way to conference committee later this month.
Looking forward to the final, conferenced bill:
Sorting through various proposals, sources suggest a possible solution agenda:
Rebate for bottom 34 million payroll taxpayers
30% expensing for 12 months (maybe compromise of 18 months)
Five year net-loss carry back Unemployment insurance extension and some expansion -- maybe through help directly to states (more Rep. Governors may like that) and some COBRA assistance.
Repeal of Corporate AMT (or several-year suspension) as concessions to House Republicans (Dems go along but say it will be a big mistake)
Odds and Ends from Appropriators (energy assistance, food assistance, etc)
All of this comes to around $100 billion.  Although the numbers have gravitated steadily northward, there is one major decision to be made that could add another $40 billion to the total (bringing the final stimulus package to something like $120-$140B): More Rebate Checks
Both House and Senate agree there should be a rebate for those workers who did not get the earlier rebate because they did not earn enough to pay income taxes (that's the bottom 34 million).   But it would be highly unlike this - or any - Congress to pass stimulus legislation that helped the bottom 20% and the top 2% (through major business tax cuts), but left the 75% in the middle out of the equation entirely.  One solution could be to send another rebate to everyone: another $38B

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


US Treasury Sec'y O'Neill has been out in front this week as an administration voice trying to shape the parameters of the Hill debates (trying to keep the lid on some proposals that could have long-term costs for the budgets several years out).    It will continue to be a delicate balance, as the administration is looking to get a final bill by the end of next week and get money into pockets in time for the end of the year.
Fed Chair Greenspan could also critically affect the debate tomorrow in testimony before the Joint Economic Committee: his core belief is that whatever the precise stimulus number arrived at, it should be primarily temporary in character.  His preference under current conditions is for security and fiscal policy to be the response instruments in the face of the diminishing returns to and efficacy of further rate reductions in the face of uncertainty.

HILL STIMULUS BILL UPDATE: 10/16/01
Partisanship is the Question for Senate Battle: Final Stimulus Bill Likely in the $80-110B Range, but Hill Dems' and Repubs' aims could push it northward
SUMMARY
Senate numbers look set to exceed Bush figures ($60-75B), may approach House Ways and Means $100B; final conferenced bill could hit $140B; all on this on top of the special $55B approved right after the attacks for airlines and immediate impact areas
Republican plan, so far, all tax cuts and no spending
Democratic plan has a lot more spending, but it is all on supporting people who have lost their jobs and none of it is on infrastructure
Final, conferenced bill may run as high as $140B if the 'neglected' middle-class is given another rebate check (up to another $38B)
One major question hanging over size, composition and speed of the Senate package is whether Senate Maj. Leader Daschle decides to move quickly toward a bipartisan Senate package that tries to isolate the House Republicans and their business tax cutting agenda
Daschle will present dilemma to President Bush and his senior advisers. "We will tell the president that we need assurance from the White House that compromises we make will be supported by the White House. If Bush can't give that assurance - unable to control the right - then we will probably opt for the more partisan position."
REPORT
The centrifugal pull of a big number like $100B proved the main attractor in early action on the stimulus front.  House Ways and Means Committee votes approved a tax cut package - mainly for businesses - that added up to just about exactly that number.  The Senate will produce something a little smaller, but the handwriting is on the wall as the two houses of Congress move toward a Conference Committee package that could easily top that total.
One key member of the Senate negotiations told sources late Sunday: "We are working on a package designed to stay with the principle that everything should be temporary and roll off after one year to avoid blowing through budget surpluses later.  Right now we are still aiming to stay in Bush's $60B to $75B bracket, but everyone knows the final number will go up from there."
Although Senate process is controlled by Democrats, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus (Dem) is in a highly contested re-election campaign next year in a deeply Republican state.  Just as he did with the earlier Bush tax cut plan, you can expect him to reach out to work with senior Republicans (such as Grassley) despite the wishes of more partisan members of the leadership.
Likely elements of the Democratic Senate package:
Rebates for those who pay payroll taxes but did not get the first $300 or $600 rebate. This was also in the House Republican package.
Temporary investment incentive for businesses - this could easily be 30% - but they will keep it to one year.
Some form of extending the loss-carryback for businesses and allowing one-year use of AMT credits in 2002. The loss-carryback is quite likely because of the relatively small 10-year costs. For Democrats AMT is more complicated. (see below)
Some form of expanded unemployment insurance incentive - not just extending the number of weeks, but other elements to expand who is eligible.
50% rebate for unemployed workers who pay for extended health care benefits through the COBRA program.
Partisanship Question:
There are a series of senior Democrats who argue that an early compromise could be a major mistake since House Republicans will simply "pocket the concessions we make toward Republican-style tax cutting and press on with their business tax cutting agenda during the conference committee." In other words, does Daschle position the Senate Democrats for the bipartisan high road after this bill is passed or does he position Democrats for the partisan wrangling that seems very likely all the way to conference committee later this month.
Looking forward to the final, conferenced bill:
Sorting through various proposals, sources suggest a possible solution agenda:
Rebate for bottom 34 million payroll taxpayers
30% expensing for 12 months (maybe compromise of 18 months)
Five year net-loss carry back Unemployment insurance extension and some expansion -- maybe through help directly to states (more Rep. Governors may like that) and some COBRA assistance.
Repeal of Corporate AMT (or several-year suspension) as concessions to House Republicans (Dems go along but say it will be a big mistake)
Odds and Ends from Appropriators (energy assistance, food assistance, etc)
All of this comes to around $100 billion.  Although the numbers have gravitated steadily northward, there is one major decision to be made that could add another $40 billion to the total (bringing the final stimulus package to something like $120-$140B): More Rebate Checks
Both House and Senate agree there should be a rebate for those workers who did not get the earlier rebate because they did not earn enough to pay income taxes (that's the bottom 34 million).   But it would be highly unlike this - or any - Congress to pass stimulus legislation that helped the bottom 20% and the top 2% (through major business tax cuts), but left the 75% in the middle out of the equation entirely.  One solution could be to send another rebate to everyone: another $38B

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


If I were President George W. Bush's Speech Writer. By Mitchell R. Robb
Good evening my fellow Americans.
First, I want to pass on my condolences to the people of New York and all
Americans that are hurting in this tragic time. You can rest assured that
anything and everything that can be done to assure the safety of our country
will be done.
This is the greatest country in the world and we will get through this
trying
time.
Now is the time for all people to set aside our petty differences and
show the world that no one or nothing can destroy the fortitude of the
American people.
To the people responsible for today's tragedy, I say this: Are you fucking
kidding me? Are the turbans on your heads wrapped too tight?
Have you gone too long without a bath? Do you not know who you are fucking
with? Americans are so hungry to kill, that we shoot at each other every
day.
We will relish that opportunity for new targets for our aggression. Have you
forgotten history? What happened to the last people that started fucking
around with us? Remember the little yellow bastards over in Japan? We
slapped
them all over the Pacific and roasted about 2 million of them in their own
back yard. That's what we in America call a big ass barbecue. Ever seen
Texas
on a map? Ever wonder why it's so big? Because  we wanted it that way,
Mexico
started jacking around with the Alamo and now they cut our lawns. England?
We
sent them packing. Ask your buddy Saddam about fucking with the good 'ole
USA. The only reason he got away the first time is because it's too hard to
shoot someone when you're doubled over laughing at them. Our soldiers aren't
trained to laugh and shoot at the same time. Now he couldn't stop a pack of
cub scouts from taking over his shitty little country. Trust us, Afghanistan
will end up a giant kitty litter box. Go ahead and try to hide, Bin Laden.
There's not a hole deep enough or a mountain high enough that's going to
keep
your camel riding asses safe. We will bomb every inch of the country that
harbors him, his camps and any place that looks and even smells like he was
there. Hell, we might even drop a few bombs on people that have pissed us
off
in the past. This is America. We kick ass. This is what we do. Go ahead and
laugh now, but the Tomahawks are coming and we will smoke your sorry asses.
God bless America!

basically, the pl is a "big brother" to the undergraduate chapter.  the pl
needs to provide guidance to the chapter in areas of fraternity policy, risk
management, the ritual, rush, and chapter finances.  he needs to attend at
least one (1) chapter meeting per month.  ideally, this man is 25 - 30 years
old; he needs to be able to relate to the chapter on a personal level, while
guiding them in the areas, above.  he does not need to be an expert in these
areas.  he needs to be an influence in both good times and bad times.  it
would also be helpful for him to possess or establish a good rapport with
the
greek affairs office and the dean of students.

the ug chapter has been without an involved pl since 1998; they hold one
chapter meeting per month; the only time the ritual is used is for
initiation.  the payroll checks bounced in september and the kitchen was
temporarily closed in late september - early october.

Team:

I have asked Troy Denetsosie to be responsible for compiling and updating a detailed supply, market and infrastructure analysis of Texas.  This information will support both our origination and trading activities and we will use a lot of the format (website and other) developed by the other regions.  Spcifically,  Troy will offload a lot the analysis work that JD is currently doing on the market side and he will work closely with Bryan Hull to support the more immediate needs of the traders.

The deliverables from Troy will be: (1) a Texas section on the gas fundamentals webpage modeled after the Central region, (2) a daily report on gas flows, deals, basis positons, etc., (3) a detailed infrastructure analysis (maps, flows, etc) that will support the development of our supply/market hub positions.  Please give him your support.

It is unlikely that he will have any credible opposition in a primary.  Late last spring, there was a very well liked Republican state house member (assistant majority leader Tim Pawlenty) who was set to announce his candidacy, and the day before his announcement, Vice President Cheney called him and asked him not to run. This created a great furor in the press and the party for a short time.  Pawlenty agreed not to run, citing his desire that the party remain united so that we have a better chance of beating Wellstone. Although folks in the party were a tad miffed that Cheney was trying to be kingmaker, they ultimately want to win more than they want to put up other candidates.

Tim Pawlenty has now announced that he will run for Governor. Jessie Ventura, true to form, has said that he won't make up his mind until next summer!  If Ventura runs again, he has a very good chance of being re elected (he still has approval ratings in the 65-70% range).

As I mentioned earlier,  I don't believe that Wellstone will ever look at our issues in a rational or market oriented manner.  I tend to think that his votes will be just the same regardless of whether we back another candidate or not.

Ken,

I wanted to update you on the reaction to your most recent letter to the Indian Prime Minister. You recall that we recommended you write again to the Prime Minister and express disappointment at the lack of progress since your July trip and your August letter containing our offer to sell our equity at costs. I believe writing this letter was the proper response but only time will tell what reaction (if any) finally comes from the Indian government.

I think you should know about the press coverage of the letter, just in case the letter were to come up in any conversation you might have with someone from the US government. I am not anticipating this at all, but I would not want you to be unprepared about the press coverage. The US embassy over here is very much up to speed.  I met again with Ambassador Blackwill on Tuesday of this week and gave him a general update on the current status. His view is that it is very difficult in the post-Sept. 11 environment to get anyone in Delhi or Washington to pay attention to economic matters such as Dabhol, but he is trying as best he can. He is meeting with Brajesh Mishra (Prime Minister's principal secretary) on Saturday, who will have just returned from Washington meetings with Ms. Rice, among others, principally to discuss anti-terrorist matters. John Hardy of our DC office briefed the State Department last week in advance of these meetings, and we are awaiting to hear any discussion or outcome regarding Dabhol.

Regarding press coverage of the letter, as we anticipated, the entire letter was leaked to the press. Several articles have appeared that describe the "harshly worded" letter and many articles have quoted verbatim sections from the letter. The Wall Street Journal article from last week presented the letter fairly, and I think it came out rather sympathetic to our position. The Indian papers have been neutral to negative. For example, an editorial (reprinted below) was in Wednesday's Financial Express, a business daily in India (but not as widely circulated or respected as The Economic Times or The Business Standard). Note the editorial below says your letter states "that any government found to have expropriated the property of US firms automatically faces sanctions from that country." Your letter did not state that, but this is a holdover from the earlier Financial Times interview.

Many people I have met with in the Indian government have made references to the letter, saying they do not think it was appropriate. I respond by saying that given our 9 year history of nothing but frustrations, and the lack of progress over the past 2 months, we do think it is appropriate and it reflects our current views regarding our experience in India. Generally, when they mention it time and again, it probably means the letter is having at least some of its intended effect.

I'll keep you, Stan and Jim updated as we hear more from the Indian government.

Wade

Dear Mr. Derrick:
Thank you for including me in this venture.  It promises to be fun and
useful.  Unfortunately, in terms of the November 2nd meeting, a faculty
candidate I'm primarily responsible for is coming through the law school
the same day.  He is giving a colloquium late morning/early afternoon and
my wife and I are hosting the dinner for him and his wife that evening.
So, especially given the post-9/11 logistics, it doesn't seem practical for
me to come to Dallas for this meeting.  One possibility might be for me to
participate by phone for a portion of the afternoon meeting and I would be
happy to do so.  But given the nature and length of the meeting, this
probably doesn't make sense - please let me know what you think.
Best regards.

Guys,

During the RCR Meeting last Monday an RCR of $30 K (US) was approved for legal and consulting support in relation to the ATCO Affiliate Code of Conduct Application.  I was asked by the RCR Committee to summarize the issues we intended to pursue once we had completed a review of the filing.  Below is an email I sent to our lawyer, Harold Huber, instructing him on the areas I wanted him to focus on in his cross examination and argument.  I believe these are fundamental code areas/issues that are of interest to Enron's operations in Alberta/Canada and therefore we should proceed to have our counsel pursue these at the hearing as was envisioned with the RCR request and subsequent approval.  Please let me know if anyone disagrees with me on this.

Regards,

Rob

Enron Ousts Finance Chief as S.E.C. Looks at Dealings

By FLOYD NORRIS

The Enron Corporation (news/quote), its stock battered by a sudden loss of investor confidence, yesterday ousted its chief financial officer, Andrew S. Fastow, whose involvement in complicated transactions with Enron has drawn the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

"In my continued discussions with the financial community, it became clear to me that restoring investor confidence would require us to replace Andy as C.F.O.," Kenneth L. Lay, Enron's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement announcing the change. Only one day before, Mr. Lay had told investors in a conference call that he and the Enron board "continue to have the highest faith and confidence in Andy."

The company said that Mr. Fastow had taken a leave of absence, but it also named his successor, Jeffrey McMahon, the head of Enron's industrial markets group and a former corporate treasurer.
Enron said none of the officials were available for interviews last night.

The move came after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where Enron's shares fell $3.38, to $16.41. The price has been cut in half since Oct. 16, when Enron reported its third-quarter earnings. A $1.2 billion reduction in shareholder equity brought on by ending some relationships with partnerships that Mr. Fastow had headed was not disclosed in the earnings news release. Mr. Lay briefly mentioned it in the conference call that followed, but some analysts thought he was referring to a separate $1 billion write-off that was disclosed in the earnings document, and were angered when they later learned about it.

On Tuesday, when both Mr. Fastow and Mr. Lay discussed the company with analysts on the conference call, neither was willing to discuss details of the transactions between Enron and the partnerships formerly controlled by Mr. Fastow. Mr. Lay cited the S.E.C. inquiry in declining to discuss the details of the transactions.

The fact the transactions took place has been known for a year, but Enron's disclosures have been widely criticized for being impossible to understand.

By structuring the deals as involving forward commitments to deliver Enron stock, it appears that Enron was able to assure that losses on them would not lead to reported losses, but instead to reductions of shareholder equity that had no effect on the income statement. That is one of the issues the S.E.C., whose inquiries were disclosed Monday by the company, is expected to address.

Concerns have also grown this week over whether Enron will face losses from complicated financing strategies that kept billions of dollars of debts off its balance sheet but left the company responsible for paying - either in cash or with stock - if things went wrong. On Tuesday, Mr. Fastow assured investors that the company "expects to continue to have sufficient liquidity to meet normal obligations," and said it had bank credit lines that were more than adequate.

Mr. Fastow was viewed as one of the architects, with Jeffrey K. Skilling, the former Enron chief executive who resigned in August, of the change in business strategy that turned Enron from a gas-pipeline company into a an energy trading powerhouse that developed a large Wall Street following. Its stock price peaked in the summer of 2000 at $90.75.

According to a person close to the company, while Mr. McMahon, Mr. Fastow's successor, was Enron's treasurer, he told Mr. Skilling, who at the time was the chief operating officer, that he thought the partnerships involving Mr. Fastow presented a conflict of interest. After that discussion, Mr. McMahon moved to a different job at the company, this person said.

Shares of Enron traded as low as $15.51 yesterday afternoon, the lowest price for the stock since early 1995, before recovering. In after- hours trading, they fell to $16.14.

One of the factors that hurt the stock yesterday was a decision by M. Carol Coale, an analyst at Prudential Securities, to drop her rating to "sell" from "hold." She had lowered the rating to "hold" from "buy" on Monday.

"After the S.E.C. inquiry was announced," she said in an interview yesterday evening, "Enron should have addressed it by delivering a scapegoat, as a gesture to the Street. Now they are replacing him today. The timing is a little late, but I think it will be received positively by the Street."

But she said that investor sentiment might work the other way. "People could fear that if you remove Fastow from the management team, you'll never get any answers."

Mark:

I called Tommy Edwards(713-209-1112) with Cima yesterday morning and talked with him about his plans for the new interconnect he has proposed.  They have completed 1 well and will drill up to 4 more development wells, in the near future.  The location he verified is Sec. 31, T19S, R21E, Eddy County, New Mexico.  He called us wanting an I/C, because the old map he was using indicated that Enron owned the lines.  The problem is that these were the gathering lines that we sold to Agave 5-6 years ago.  We still own the Atoka #1, 2 & 3 gathering compression units and the main branch lines,  but these wells will have to be connected to the Agaves Gathering system.  I spent some time looking at this yesterday afternoon and have not relayed this information to him.   Please call me to discuss any concerns, before you call Tommy.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I have a few thoughts that I think are important:
At the opening of the second paragraph, I would laud him for mandating RTOs for all generators.  That's not insignificant and I think its important to offer some praise with our very valid criticism.
I think we need to take the opportunity to point out that the "right" number of RTOs isn't simply an arbitrary number picked from a hat.  Right now, it seems to be, especially with Pat Wood suggesting last week that CA might not need to be in a west-wide RTO.  Now we're at 6 RTOs.  Do I hear 7?
Lastly, I believe the final paragraph is fraught will peril.  I feel strongly that telling a chairman, or any member of Congress, "this issue is too big and complicated and politicians will get it wrong" is a big mistake, though it's regrettably true in most cases, Dick Armey excepted.  In their view, and probably in the view of most Americans, they get paid to deal with big and complicated issues.
I believe we also set a dangerous precedent in saying "trust the regulators."  As you note, we're lucky that this FERC mostly gets it.  But the next FERC might not get it.  Nobody knows.
Our point, that Congress doesn't need to act, has to be made in a more ambiguous way.
The real answer: Don't trust politicians, or regulators.  Trust markets.  Repeal the Federal Power Act.

Lenny! jumping in the conversation without missing a beat....good to have
you with us. Nice comedy....but the only fat, bald 30 year old is the
Dogger. (just kidding dog, you's not fat....you's just fluffy). Don is
bald, but not fat. Roby is balding, but just a little "stocky". Clint has a
belly, but is not balding. Other than that, we are all pretty normal
(please use that term loosely).

Your parents would love to have us at their crib. Dog could rummage through
all of your belongings, eat all of your parents' food, and wake them up at
the ass crack of dawn with scrambled eggs and jumby. Roby could show your
mom "a good time". Porteous, Clay, and Myers could talk to your dad about
his company's legal shortcomings. Bernie could sell you all some much
needed life insurance. Clint could smoke, and Dehart could clear his lungs
so that he could ski without falling dead on the slopes. Gooch could lend
Don the money to build an addition to your maw's bathroom (so that Dog and
Roby could smell it up). And Naquin could try to get with your sister, take
notes of the whole weekend's proceedings, and make copies for all of us to
remember them by.

Porthole....see if Timmy, Tricia, Mike Thomas, etc. would be interested in
going on the trip...Lenny....see about all of your Houston Fiji buddies
(house bitch, Tim, Val, etc.). Tell Tim we'll let him bring his new wife
with him, too, although that might mean that there could be up to 3 Phi
Mu's on the trip....quorum could be met, and "the Phi Mu Crew" might be in
full effect; God help us.

Clint, what about Freret and Dawn (that might make 4 Mu's)?

Anyone else we can think of who might be interested in this trip (Jan 10 -
14th)?

** - japaneseU.S. JUDGE DISMISSES SLAVE LABOUR CASES: On September 19, 2001,
a federal judge in the United States ruled that thousands of former
Filipino, Chinese, and Korean prisoners of war who claim that they were used
as slave labour by Japanese companies during World War II may not sue for
damages in U.S. courts. U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that
the Treaty of Peace signed by the United States and a multitude of other
nations bars so-called slave labourers from seeking damages from Japanese
companies for work that may have been tantamount to slave labour. The court
decided that allowing the suits to carry on would "unsettle half a century
of diplomacy." The judge ruled a year ago that Americans were barred from
similar suits. See " Judge

the case at issue announced that he would go on sick leave for at least
three months. The following day he submitted a medical certificate, stating
he had a tumor on his hand. The tumor, however, would not necessarily have
kept the employee from working. The court therefore held that the employee's
behaviour was clearly an attempt to "punish" the employer and that it
therefore would justify a termination for cause. See " Threat Of

AGREEMENTS: The German Federal Labour Court recently ruled on that in case

do not necessarily supersede other collective regulations applicable to the
employees of the acquired company. In the respective case, the buyer
acquired a company that was previously bound by a collective bargaining
agreement that provided for annual extra payments. The buyer was not a
member of the respective employers' association and therefore not bound by
the respective collective bargaining agreement. The court ruled, however,
the provisions of the collective bargaining agreement became part of the
individual employment contracts of the employees in accordance with the
German Civil Code. Since the acquired company was located in another city
than the buyer's company, provisions of the collective bargaining agreement
were also not superseded by shop agreements applicable to the buyer's
company. According to the Court, these shop agreements are applicable only
to the employees of the respective plant location but not to the employee of
the acquired company. See " Transfer  <http://bundesarbeitsgericht.de/> of

US - muslimsHEAD OF EEOC URGES TOLERANCE TOWARD MUSLIMS AND ARAB-AMERICANS
IN THE WAKE OF THE SEPTEMBER 11 ATTACKS: The Chair of the U.S. Equal
Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), Cari Dominguez, recently
encouraged employers to guard against a backlash in the workplace against
Muslims and Arab-Americans in light of the recent terrorist attacks in the
U.S. on September 11, 2001. Dominguez urged employers to reiterate to
employees their policies against harassment based on religion, national
origin, and ethnicity. " September 11 Attack

US - LEGAL PROTECTIONS FOR RESERVISTS NOW RELEVANT TO EMPLOYERS: On
September 17, 2001, President Bush announced plans to call up 35,000
military reservists to active duty in response to the recent terrorist
attacks against the United States. All U.S. employers therefore need to be
aware of the provisions of The Uniformed Services Employment and
Reemployment Rights Act ( USERRA <http://www.msnbc.com/news/627028_asp.htm>
), a federal law that prohibits discrimination against persons because of
their service in the Armed Forces, the Army National Guard, the Air National
Guard, the commissioned corps of the Public Health Service, and other
categories of persons designated by the President in time of war or national
emergency. USERRA prohibits an employer from denying any benefit of
employment on the basis of an individual's membership, application for
membership, performance of service, application for service, or obligation
for service in the uniformed services. USERRA also protects the rights of

I just spoke to Richard Katz, who is coordinating Edison MOU efforts for
the Governor's office.  The Proclamation declaring the Special Session
is still on the Governor's desk although Richard expects him to issue it
shortly (against Richard's advice).  Richard has spoken to several key
Senators trying to convince them to pass the MOU with some form of
direct access and exit fees attached.  He said Enron should be thrilled
with the PUC action.  I responded that Enron believes continuing direct
access is necessary and wants comprehensive legislation to do it.  He
believes a bill without direct access can't pass the Assembly.  He says
staff is still meeting, but nothing conclusive has been achieved.
Although he's made his hotel reservations for next week, he suggested
that its still not 100% certain that the session will be called.

Morgan,

I have to disagree with the "they were available by phone."  Being out of the office for "Team Building" on the last day of the month is inexcusable.  I tried calling Perry and there was no answer; he said he forgot and left his phone on vibrate.  The Omaha capacity people now carry text pagers that I can email info to; they have really improved their response.  The Houston staff needs these pagers too.  Capacity approval on TW is probably our weakest link in the process.  We really need your help to improve this or drastic action will be needed.  When I called at 3 pm to get a last second deal, I didn't get called back until 3:30 pm.  I was told they could be back in the office to approve the deal around 6 pm.  Well, even though I was here until 7 pm, Reliant wasn't going to be.  Perry said he could do it Saturday, once again, Reliant (or someone who can sign contracts) wasn't.  The TW Marketers, all of them, were also out of the office making EVERYTHING fall onto Contracts.  Why are we the only one's that need to be in the office?  I'm going to give this one more month and then, if everyone isn't working together on this, I'm going to Danny and tell him the Deal Capture team is off of TW since no one appears to give a rats ass (and this is after I've calmed down over the weekend).  Speaking to the Contract Group, this is far from the first time these guys weren't available.

Rick --
Trust that Neal is keeping you in the loop on Venezuela developments.
Chavez has tried twice to reach Richardson (he keeps on trying Richardson's
home phone numbers, despite our telling his office that Richardson can best
be reached at his work numbers).  Chavez has been forward-leaning in the
tone of his voicemail messages, and we understand from Neal that Enron has
received some positive signals from the Venezuelan government in recent
days.
Richardson is back from Europe today and we'll check with him on any Chavez
updates, as well as press to make phone contact if it hasn't happened in the
past few days.
Attached is the public announcement of the important changes in the gas
sector that we previewed for you some weeks ago.  Our assessment continues
to be that this change is more positive for the Jose project than not.
Best,

These agree to the amounts that we previously sent to AEP in a letter earlier this month except for a slight adjustment to the Centanna Ad Valorem Tax Expense number as I received an updated number from the Tax Department this week.  I have also told Jim Dedicker at AEP that I will forward him a copy of the bill from Jefferson County once we receive it.  Also keep in mind that this working capital calculation statement does not include the working gas adjustments for Bammel and Centanna which were already sent in a "Final Working Gas Calculation Statement" on 10/15.

She was originally included in the second list requested by Hetzel; however, Glover indicated to you he no longer wants to take her deposition but we may notice it.  This will be at our costs and Marnie is willing to come based on the representation that she can expense the flight as she is still employed until November 15, 2001 and I will take care of the hotel.

Chad Beers is in the process of transferring to Houston and can be available any time.

Michelle is checking with Ken Rice and Kevin Hannon to round up the second list of requested deponents.

Rod, please forward this note to Mark Lindsey ASAP (I can't find his name on
our email address book and I've had trouble with sending him things in the
past).

Attached is a file that includes unusual accounting adjustments and/or
implementation adjustments we're proposing as a result of our new rate case
order.  These adjustments total $31.3m (IBIT), and $29.8m (Net Income for Q3
2001.  Forecasted results for Q3 we've been sending to you (including our 3rd
Current Estimate) include these adjustments.   Accordingly, not getting AA&Co
concurence on any of these issues will have a negative impact on PGG's Q3
results.

For entries affecting PGH & PVC (see tab), we need to make sure Enron Corp is
supportive of our treatment.  This is because although AA&Co. Portland will be
reviewing our records and our reasons for the adjustments, they will likely
pass on the AA&Co. Houston any of these items they may question.  This is
because their primary focus is PGE earnings, not PVC or PGH since we don't
report these companies out any place publicly on a stand-alone basis.  We've
passed along the Merger MOU proposal to AA&Co. Portland already since it has
ties to our rate order (and they're thinking about it), but we're waiting to
hear back from you that the other three items on the list are support by you,
then we'll pass them on to AA&Co Portland for review.  Please respond back by
next Monday, Sept 24th to allow us appropriate time to get them reviewed by
AA&Co.

All the items on the PGE tab have been explained to AA&Co. Portland, and we're
hoping to get their position on these adjustments by next Monday, Sept 24.  We
feel we have good justification for all the adjustments, but some are more of
a stretch than others (when projecting whether or not AA&Co will approve
them).

Please call if you have any questions.  thanks

My plan is to also have Barbara attend, with the intent that she work on developing a relationship with Governor Huckabee in Arkansas (we havn't had contact with him before,  but found that one of his commissioners at the Arkansas PUC seems to be favorable on our RTO position--one of the few that we can find in the southeast that even lean in the right direction)

I also would like for Steve Montovano and Paul Kaufman to come up for the Friday night dinner after your direct reports meeting being held that week in Colorado Springs.

Let me know if you have any thoughts to the contrary.  Otherwise I will go ahead with these plans. The only other individual that I think might be appropriate would be Jean Ryall in order for her to have some face time with the Texas delegation.

I have already spoken with the guy at Wisvest charged with re-marketing the assets.  I expressed to him our desire to discuss acquisition of the plants and that we are prepared to move quickly.   He indicated that they are going to take the next couple of weeks to assess how best to re-market these facilities, and that they were leaning towards an "open RFP" type process, perhaps with the help of an i-bank advisor.
My objective is to steer them away from this path, and in that regard, I gave him a run-down of a number of reasons why they would do well to enter discussions with us ASAP (e.g., unique situation in that we serve load in UI's area, good relationship with the CT regulators, no market power concerns that killed the NRG deal, ability to affect improvements/clean-up at the sites, etc.).  He asked me to send him a letter outlining these qualifiers, and was recptive to a meeting in the near future (I am going to try and hook up with him in CT as he is on business there this week).
As for location, these plants definitely are in a good spot given that southern CT is quite constrained.  However, the really binding constraint is in the Norwalk-Stamford area --  these plants are located outside of this area.  I am trying to get some more granular information on the locations/severity of constraints in southern CT to help assess constraints in the Bridgeport-New Haven area where the plants are.
One other point is that the one of the units at the Bridgeport station is in deactived reserve (an 80 MW oil plant), so there may be some relatively cheap expansion/repowering plays.
I did learn that they have an asset management deal with a 3rd-party through mid next year, unless they sell off the plants before then.
I will update with status as we move along

Last Friday, Stewart Rosman and I met with Al Paschke, our BPA transmission rep.  During our meeting, Stewart and I discussed some concerns about BPA transmission such as load following service, 10-min dispatch for A/S, how BPA's decremental cost is calculated, control area reserves, and line losses.  He suggested we put together a list of transmission issues/requests for products that he could present to TBL on our behalf.  He said it would be more effective for us to give him a written document, as opposed to just having him relay our oral comments.

Please send me any suggestions you have for improving TBL's services.  If you will provide me with something to start with, I would be happy to polish it up and include it with the rest of our issues.

Obviously, TBL moves slowly so it is unlikely that any changes would happen immediately.  However, TBL has a one-year rate case every other year.  Next year is that year, so if we get our ideas in the hopper this year, we might see some of them in TBL's next rate proposal.

RUDY KEEPS HIS WORD
By KIRSTEN DANIS, DAVID SEIFMAN and BILL HOFFMANN
September 17, 2001 -- Diane
Gorumba of Brooklyn beamed with
pride yesterday as Mayor Giuliani
walked her down the aisle - and
helped erase a nightmarish year of
tragedy for the Brooklyn bride's
family.
The mayor kept a promise he made
last month to Diane, 23, after her
firefighter brother, Michael, who
was supposed to give her away,
died Aug. 28 while fighting a
three-alarm blaze on Staten Island.
"We will go on. This proves it right
here. The mayor came here - he
thought about us," the beaming
newlywed said as she jumped into a
limo with husband, Michael Ferrito,
31, a police officer at the 61st
Precinct.
Diane has already lived through 12
months of her own horrors. Her grandfather died Sept. 13,
2000, and 17 days later, her dad, an executive at J.P.
Morgan Chase, also passed away.
With her father gone, she asked her brother, a member of
Engine Co. 163, to walk her down the aisle at St. James
Lutheran Church in Gerrittsen Beach, and he agreed.
Then, the Staten Island fire tragedy took Michael's life.
At Michael's funeral, Diane sadly lamented to her mom, Gail,
that there was nobody to escort her up to the altar. She
half-jokingly turned to the mayor and asked, "Why don't you
do it?"
"I'd be honored," Giuliani replied, without missing a beat.
Yesterday morning, Giuliani - who has been working round
the clock since the Twin Towers horror - said the wedding
meant "a great deal to him."
The mayor recalled asking Gail Gorumba, after her son died,
how she has kept going through her grief.
"She feels the pain of it, she allows the pain to happen,"
Giuliani said. "But then she focuses on the good things that
are left in life, like her daughter's wedding. I thought about
that a good deal of time this week."
The bride and groom's families said they will be eternally
grateful to him.
"It meant more than I can ever, ever say. He's the best, and
I wish we could re-elect him" Diane said.
As 225 people jammed the quaint 77-year-old church, the
mayor gave Diane his left arm.
Smiling happily for perhaps the first time since the Tuesday
disaster, Giuliani - clad in black tie with a white rose in his
lapel - slowly strode down the aisle and brought Diane to the
groom.
Then he lifted her veil and kissed her on the cheek.
As the 30-minute ceremony proceeded, the mayor sat in the
front row with the bride's mom. Afterward, Giuliani got into
his car to head back to Manhattan, and the serious work at
hand.

Hi Group,

Need input for Lari as our ride approaches (Pat can you forward to Lu and
ask him to reply to me).

I know some of you have ridden with Lari many times, but her scheduler is
facilitating this process and has asked for some information.  Please
provide the following and I will batch and send to Lari:


Years riding
How often currently riding
type of riding (i.e. English lessons, dressage, trail)
type of saddle preferred
age, height and weight


Also, we initially planned on an all-day ride on Sat, and a four-hour ride
on Sunday so we could all head back relatively early.  Lari would like to
know where we want to ride on each day.  Nora is only riding for the
four-hour ride, and prefers the beach.  How about an all-day ride in the
redwoods on Saturday, with a four-hour beach ride on Sunday?

Sara,
Thank you for reviewing and returning the equity forward confirmations
so promptly.    We have reviewed the handwritten comment on page 8 of
the contract and unfortunately cannot accept the language as presented.
Our concern is that if we are unable to get through to Clint for any
reason (either speaking to him directly or getting voice mail), the
termination notice would not be effective.
We propose to insert the following language instead:
"Such Non-Affected Party will use commercially reasonable efforts
to
promptly confirm the transmission of such facsimile notice by
telephone (telephone number 713-345-7538) to the Affected Party,
provided however, that failure to so confirm will not in anyway
invalidate the effectiveness of a notice by facsimile
transmission."
(insert as the last sentence of the third paragraph under
"Additional
Termination Event".)
Please let me know if this works for you.  If so, we will produce new
contracts with the language and send it back to you for another round
of signatures.
Please call me if you have any questions.  I apologize for any
inconvenience this may cause.
Regards,
Christine

What do you think about this? The first attachment is what you and I discussed Vasco.  The second is what SBA originally proposed.  Keep in mind that SBA has offered a 30% reduction on the original fees if another LDC retains him, but as you said, even those reduced fees seemed high to one of the LDC's who reviewed them, so we may not get the reduction.  I don't want to rely on that.

Dear Family and Friends,

Ken and I have invited my father and his two lady friends (Cathy Hofgren and
Mary Walsh) to visit us at the Huntingdon in Houston for a long weekend.
The visit has been scheduled for late Thursday evening, October 11 until the
afternoon of Monday, October 15.  Unless the horrific events of the past two
weeks and it's aftermath causes some unforeseen problem, we will move
forward with their visit.  Pop-Pop is anxious to "catch up" and see everyone
in the family and some of our friends; he particularly wants to see his
precious great grand children.  Considering his age and the difficulty in
the logistics for him to see everyone, we are planning one big "extended"
family/friends casual dinner for Friday, October 12 @5:30 p.m. in the Pool
Room @River Oaks Country Club.  Mark your calendars and hopefully, most of
you will be available to join us.

I am aware of two noteworthy events in October; the first is Sharon Lay's
birthday on October 8th and the second is Halloween.  Therefore, if Sharon
is able to attend, we will have a Halloween birthday party.  With Halloween
as our theme, we will have "FRIENDLY" costumes for all children attending
and games to play.

Jessica will be e-mailing you with a guest list and getting a definite head
count, as we get closer to Pop-Pop's arrival.  If any of you have other
family members or friends who would enjoy seeing Pop-Pop and/or celebrating
Sharon's birthday and you would like for them to join us, please let me
know.

Lots of Love, Mom/Linda

Steve,

I understand that you are out today; I hope it's vacation.

By tomorrow (Friday), we will have a notebook with Underwriters' most recent request for invoices and supporting documents, with responses (the documents you gave us).

May I impose on you again to meet on Friday with me and Becky Zikes, my legal assistant, to review the documentation and make sure we have attached the (a) correct and (b) complete supports?  I recall someone else you worked meeting with us at the same time you gave us the supporting documents, but my notes don't reflect her name.  If you think it would be profitable to have that person in the meeting, let's get her included.

After you and I meet, I will be sending a copy of this package of documents to Jim Studdert, to discuss the best and most expedient manner of presenting this to Sharron West.  Jim is out until Monday, and then in the office only sporadically until November 8.  I have a meeting scheduled with him Monday morning (with our broker to join us by phone).

Given our short time frame before the two-year statute of limitations against Baytank expires, I am preparing a lawsuit to be filed against them to preserve any causes of action that we may have.  I am considering asking Baytank for an extension of time to sue, but I know that we did that in the past, and Baytank said no.

I look forward to hearing about your availablity for a meeting on Friday.  Becky and I would be happy to come over there, or set up a conference room for you to come over here.

Team:
Just wanted to let everyone know that Finance Day 2001 at MSB went very well from Enron's perspective.  Mark Bonney (Manager, RAC) and I were on two panels and led a discussion of a short case (theme: proposed new power plant in U.S.) during the Enron-sponsored lunch.  Although Enron's current difficulties were not raised by any student (the Finance Club had recommended against bringing the events of last week up), they were raised by a professor during the second panel.  Mark and I did our best to put LJM and other current issues in perspective.
After lunch, one student summed up the apparent sentiments of all.  She said, "Enron has stood by Georgetown in this difficult year by interviewing on campus and bringing eight of us back for Super Saturday.  A lot of "fair weather" employers are absent this year.  Enron has stood by Georgetown, and Georgetown will stand by Enron."  That was neat to hear.
If anyone has the time to "stand by" Paul, please help him out with Wharton and Stern.

I'm trying to sell 10,000/d off Blk Marlin into Carbide for Nov & Dec 01.
Jody was a pass on HSC - $0.03 because of other gas he has flowing
which he now indicates is showing up at HSC - $0.04 to $0.05.

Nelson hasn't confirmed price to me but the best I've heard from him was
a HSC - $0.04 and he wanted to better Spinniker's price.

Our last shot for Nov & Dec is Monday.
After that, we have a shot at gas that comes up Jan 01 at TX City.


Jody still wants to see a delivered price off of MOPS and he seems to
be expecting HSC - $0.10 to $0.12 based on gas he's buying at
El Paso Blessing.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Steve,
Jim Steffes called me to inquire as to the information you are interested in, regarding the California refund case, and I passed the following along to him by phone:
Status of the refund claim:
The CAISO refund claims made in CAISO letters to Congress, and the final claim at the FERC-ordered settlement conference, were approximately $38 MM.  The initial claim in the California Refund case before Judge Birchman was very similar, although the most recent CAISO claim is that they owe us $1MM!  A review of their claim revealed errors.  I asked Charles River Associates to re-run the numbers correcting only the errors and they came up with a $57MM figure.  Please note that this number resulted from an internal exercise and is not a claim by the ISO.  However, I consider this the maximum exposure from what is known at this time.  I expect that CAISO will revise its claim against us around December 7, and I will communicate the new claim as soon as I receive it.
Points summarizing the proceeding:
The California refund proceeding at FERC, unlike the Pacific Northwest proceeding, contemplates that refunds will be paid and orders the Judge to determine the amount of the refunds.
Issues to be decided by the Judge include (1) the amounts of the mitigated market claiming price (2) the amounts owed by each seller and (3) the amount that a seller may offset against its refund obligation.
This proceeding has been delayed due to errors and omissions in the California ISO's data.
Due to deficiencies in the data, it is also difficult to assess potential exposure. The California ISO's claims have thus far been erroneous.
Hearings are scheduled to occur on December 17-21 and February 11-15. The Judge's ruling is expected on March 8, 2002.
Timing of the FERC Order:
It is difficult to say how quickly the Commission may rule after receiving the Judge's certification of findings and record on March 8.  Arguably, they could act very quickly due to the limited scope of the proceeding and the fact that the Judge's findings will likely be limited to the three issues described above.

Larry,

I called Roger this morning to make sure he had received the BA.  He said
that he had not yet gotten it, but that it should be there around noon.  I
asked him to be sure to get back to me ASAP with any inadequacies, so we
could fix them immediately.  He said that they have decided that they don't
need to have all of the ESA requirements satisfied prior to Public Noticing
the project.  This is good news.  He didn't say how soon they would be able
to Notice it, but they don't have to wait for the BA to be exactly what they
want it to be, prior to.  Scott

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Last night, Linda and I spent a fairly long time with Leon Lowery, Chairman Bingaman's chief electricity advisor, to discuss our concerns with the transparency and market-based rate language -- while at the same time commending the transmission access language in the draft and strategizing how to support the chairman in that regard.

We made progress on transparency, less so on market-based rates.

On transparency, Leon understands our concerns.  In a nutshell, he seemed amenable to amending the langauge to avoid the result of having to divulge transaction-specific, trade-specific information.  We persuaded Leon that was the impact of the initial language, although he initially said details would be left to FERC.  We persuaded him that if any data is to be provided, it MUST be only in aggregate form.  We also impressed on him that if, as he said, the intent is to leave details to FERC -- then more of the details should be left to FERC, not set by statute.

Leon strongly advised that we seek to craft language consistent with the above exchange that makes as few changes to the draft as needed to make the necessary corrections.  This will make it easier for Leon to navigate the internal waters of the staff.  (Sam Fowler, th chief counsel, is a drafting stickler).

Others should obviously weigh in and review this, but to facilitate internal comments (we need to get back to Leon today), here is my take on what he has in mind.  Under new sec. 218(b) (to be added to the FPA by bill sec. 413) (pg. 13), under "information required" we would rewrite paragraph 2 as follows:

(2)  each broker, exchange, or other market-making entity that matches offers to sell and offers to buy wholesale electric energy in interstate commerce to provide aggregate statistical information about its sales of electric energy at wholesale in interstate commerce.

The effect of the language change is drop the reference to sale prices of each sale of electric energy.  By leaving it as aggregate statistical information, this should give FERC maximum flexibility to permit indexes, etc.

As to the "timely basis" of information release (subsection (c)), the alternatives sent yesterday would require this to be done on the Internet after the end of the trading day.  If we can restrict this to aggregate data, question arises whether we want to concede that this would be done daily.  That suggests the data to be collected would be more than we would want, I think.  Here is a take on how we might suggest a revision to that language to give FERC more leeway:

"(c) TIMELY BASIS -- The Commission shall require the information required under subsection (b) to be posted on the Internet and updated as frequently as practicable and appropriate.

The change is to add "appropriate" so that FERC can consider other than whether posting is practicable.  The use of "appropriate" is what came to mind -- perhaps there is some other word or phrase like "consistent with ..." or "promote competition" or some way of saying there are policy considerations other than practicability.  There should be some valid purpose established before data is released.  I would argue that the (d) language on commercially sensitive information goes only to exempting from disclosure, not when disclosure is appropriate.

Please let me have your thoughts, although the tragedy in NYC and DC now underway will probably make this not a day to transact such business on the Hill.

Will provide a further report on market-based rates.  In sum, Leon was not as sympathetic on this issue, but asked for our ideas and further arguments.  We sense Leon personally feels strongly about moving the FPA to some linkage to competitive markets.  His argument is that market participants can be doing everything by the book and the result can still be uncompetitive markets.  We pushed that penalizing us is not the answer -- nor is increasing regulatory uncertainty about deals doing to help keep prices down.  Leon clearly does not intend this language to punish Enron -- but others who we might all agree have done things that are not in keeping with competitive markets.

Ms. MingchengLian
Manager,EGM/Fundamentals
713-529-0864
Dear Mr. Lay,
My employment with Enron is to be terminated, the reason given by HR, for not meeting performance standards. However, I firmly believe that this is not the real reason, the real one being for defying the wishes of my manager (Mr. Lowell Bezanis,Manager, EGM) who, I believe was acting in a discriminatory way towards me.  I have since filed a written complaint to Enron's EEO Committee.
This committee, having investigated the case, has acknowledged that there were working environment issues but has refused to provide me with a written report of their findings.  As a consequence, my reasonable request for a re-deployment package has been rejected.
If my employment is to be prematurely terminated I not only lose my job, but also my residence status in the US where I have lived in the past 8 years.  The HR department is fully aware of my situation and I feel that they were taking advantage of this fact when they asked me to sign a waiver not to sue Enron in exchange for protecting my status for 30 days.  I now feel that I am being pushed into a corner, unnecessarily, since all I have set out to achieve is to bring an awareness of the working conditions and the discrimination which is rife (not only towards myself but also to other employees, some of whom have left as a result) in the department and to move forward with practicable solutions.
I have enjoyed a number of years as an employee of Enron where I have performed to the best of my ability, often receiving compliments from clients.  This cannot be the only way to solve this issue!
The Trigger and Retaliation.
Since Mr. Bezanis has been my line manager, internal training opportunities have repeatedly been denied to me.  On August 28, I attended a class of 'natural gas structuring'. Mr. Bezanis called the Learning Center refusing to pay the associated costs, however, I was welcomed to remain in the class at no charge.
I felt that this situation could not continue and so I made an appointment with Ms. Shanna Funkhouser (my HR representative).  The day previous to the aforementioned meeting I was summoned to appear before Ms.Funkhouser.  Mr. Bezanis and Mr. Jeff Andrews were present in the conference room as I entered.  Feeling intimidated, I requested that I meet with Ms. Funkhouser privately the next day in order to submit a formal complaint regarding the EEO, as agreed previously.  She refused and continued with what I can only describe as adisciplinary by accusing me of excessive use of Enron property and equipment.  I was suspended and sent home with pay with possible termination. Ms. Funkhouser explained that her actions were based on the following:
-        the assumption that I was making long distance personal calls from work
-        that I was making jobapplications by company email
Unequal Employment Opportunities and Unfair Treatment.
As a manager, Mr. Bezanis has:
-        Intentionally and consistently limited my employment opportunities in terms of training and performance appraisals.  He has repeatedly disapproved of my training courses without good cause since he refuses to explain his disapproval.
- Shown unfavorable bias towards my job performance (PRC process) which according to the PRC rules should be judged also by my peers' and clients' by review.  Until now, I am still have not been informed of my PRC results.
-        Made efforts to suppress my innovative ideas such as that of creating an 'energy index' as a potential useful trading instrument.  My idea was warmly welcomed by the team in the Department Offsite, but the reaction of Mr. Bezanis was of anger for not going through him first.  I was banned by him from developing the idea further.
Discrimination.
It is our belief that Mr. Bezanis has difficulty dealing with women employees, especially competent women, as equals.  His rough, stifling, and unfair management style has led to the resignation of Ms. Courtney Campbell, the other only woman reporting to him.
Hostile Working Environment.
The working environment under Mr. Bezanis has been an intimidating and abusive one. Derogatory language offensive to women is frequent and common. Very little respect is paid to our integrity and intelligence.  We are managed by "threats" rather than constructive comments.
Wrongful Termination.
Knowing I was unfairly treated, Enron HR has not helped address my concerns.  I was told that my employment is to be terminated due to my lowest ranking in the mid-year PRC process.  Ms. Cindy Olson admitted that the PRC practices might be unfair, but she said she had no power to re-open the past PRC cases.  I feel I have been subjected to a victimization campaign while the whole Enron organization attempts to protect the managers, no matter how wrong they are.  I request your attention and help during my most difficult time.
I thank you for your understanding and commitment to a happy and positive resolution in this case.
Yours sincerely,
Mingcheng Lian

Louise, you had asked us to alert you immediately of any counterparty that makes noises consistent with an alteration of their trading policy with us.

I've just spoken with Wisconsin Gas (the state's largest gas LDC), and they told me that the February basis transaction (20 contracts--Enron the buyer) we had come to basic agreement upon last week had been put on hold.  As the customer put it, "We had a risk management meeting at the end of the week, and we've decided to put that transaction on hold.  We'll let you know when we're able to move forward on that".

We had reached agreement on Wednesday, but at that time my counterpart said that he would be out of the office for a couple of days and would wait until Monday to close the deal.  After not hearing from him during the morning, I called to close the transaction and was told that they could not go through with it.

WIGas has continued to trade <30 day physical gas with us on EOL--seven trades so far today.

Please let me know if there is any additional information you need or if there are any further actions you'd like me to take.  Thanks.

Alberto,

If the meeting with the Governor is on for Thursday, lets try to have a meeting with Rafael on Friday. Could you please try to arrange the meeting for both of us?, let me know please.

With regard to majority stakes, we have indicated in several ocassions that Enron would be more than willing to increase PDVSA"s (in this case the government) stake to a higher number. So, I don't really believe this should be a showstopper for Jose. On the other hand, although we will have to see the by-laws and shareholders agreements to be precise, a 33% stakes gives you nothing more than a simple majority. Still, Shell and Exxon together clearly control the venture. It is also stupid to say that "not in a single country in the world.......". How about Trinidad for example. I'm not sure if he is referring to the Governments or companies?.

We can clear this up in our meeting with him. Let me know if and when is he available to meet.

Thansk a lot,

Emilio

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Naveed/John--as you know, I did meet here in Minneapolis today with Julie Jorgensen and Tom Micheletti of Exclesior Energy Inc. regarding their proposal for the Mesaba Energy Project. I basically went over the questions that I had expressed to you guys on Friday.  Ultimately, they will need a tremendous amount of political capital to get all the pieces of the deal included in legislation. Please keep in mind that the Senate in Minnesota is controlled by the Democrats and the House is controlled by the Republicans.  The Governor is independent, and the primary agencies in his administration that would be involved in approving/promoting this deal would the the Pollution Control Agency (PCA) the Dept of COmmerce, the Enviromental Quality Board (EQB) and to some degree, the Public Utilities Commission (PUC).

The generation piece of their project is probably quite doable from a regulatory and legislative standpoint.  The site that they have identified (and I understand they may have 2 other possible sites) is in a district of the state that is currently economically disavantaged.  The Iron Range legislative delegation is strong at the Capitol, and the Majority leader of the Senate is from the  Iron Range (Roger Moe).  Because of the amount of jobs that would be created and the fact that the project would be considered a "clean" fuel would go a long way to allowing regulatory approvals and incentive monies such as the funding proposed by the IRRRB and other state agencies.  Although we didn't specifically discuss tax incentives, there could very possibly be some assistance provided as well. There would most likely be an appetite for including language in a legislative package to either exempt or "fast track" the generation siting process that is currently cumbersome in the state.

The much larger issue is the transmission build out.  My understanding is that Excelsior's current strategy is to try to include in legislation a designation of the right of way for the transmission to be built from the Iron Range into the load centers--Minneapolis and St. Paul. In essence, they hope to have legislation that would circumvent the current siting statute and rules for transmission.  Their reasoning is that all of the Democrats would vote for this proposal and they would just need to pick up a handful of Republicans. There are several concerns about this reasoning--the enviromental community, the local cities/counties that the line would run thru,, the neighborhood groups--just to name a few. While I agree that most Democrats would vote party line because of jobs (and I think that even more jobs are lost in the next 18 months due to economic downturns in the taconite/steel and paper/pulp markets), some of them will get picked off by the constituency groups.  Excelsior would need to get "buy off" from these groups, which will be expensive (hence, the wind proposal) in order to obtain their support at the legislature. This would be difficult.  A fall back position if Excelsior was not able to circumvent the current siting and permitting process would be to have the legislation "fast track" the process.

The other significant issue is the PPA.  My understanding is the Excelsior invisions legislation that would "force" the utility (most likely Xcel/NSP because they are the only IOU that has needs identified) to buy the power under a PPA and that the rate or at least the parameters that the rate must fall within would be actually included in legislative language.  This is going to raise all kinds of protests from various groups, not the least of which would be the industrial buyers in the state who are active in PUC regulatory proceedings--they will argue that they will bear the brunt of higher rates that would be incurred by such a contract rather then Xcel sourcing thru a competitive bid.  From a simplistic standpoint, it would seem that a better route would be to get the munis and coops in the state to bid on the output and avoid the significant obstacles that PPA language in the legislation would encounter.

Exclesior has not yet gotten strong sign off from either party or the Governors office.  They have met with the Senate leadership, and have gotten a preliminary blessing.  They have had meetings with Governor Ventura's office and his Administrative agencies, and my sense is that they will get some backing from the PCA and the Dept of Commerce.  They may run into trouble with the PUC and the EQB.  Ultimately, though, if they convince Ventura, the agencies will fall into line.  They have not
yet pitched the idea to the Republicans.  They have hired a republican lobbyist who is knowledgeable in energy fights.

So....my assessment at this time would be as follows:

1.  the development team has some credibility--Jorgenson has a reputation as a good developer. Michaletti is well known at the capitol--he has some strong ties to the range delegation, but he also has some legislators that don't like him at all (especially those on the enviromental side and some women).  They would need to supplement their efforts with one or more outside lobbyists.


2.  they still have alot of work to do to see if the project is politically palatable to a wide range of constituencies.  The democrats and unions are the only natural constituencies for them.  The legislative session runs from January to May.  My bet would be that it would take 2 sessions to get a deal of this size done, unless that have STRONG support from the democrats and republicans going into January.


3.  wild card could be the munis and coops as well as the economy.  If the munis and coops buy into the concept and want the transmission line built in order to serve their needs, they have political grass roots in each and every county of the state (Minnesota has approx 120 munis and 40 coops).  If the economy takes an even bigger nose dive, Democrats will be forced to support whether there are environmental consequences to the tranmission lines or not.


I will try to call you in the morning to discuss.  Hope this is helpful and I am happy to discuss with other members of your team and obviously willing to help in implementing strategy if you decide to move forward with a stronger look at the project.

Mike,

Kent and Tim called me this morning and said that they have received a letter from LS Power requesting compensation for costs they feel they incurred to adjust their supply due to cuts on their FDD overrun.  Their analysis applies to the period June 1, 2001 to present.  Kent and Tim need data to perform an analysis that will be used to respond to LS Power's (USES) request.

Kent has requested the following for the period June 1 forward:

A list of days where at least one cycle was not allocated (in other words, if we allocated one or more cycles of a gas day, but not every cycle (regardless of which cycle was not allocated), they need an electronic list of those days.
Electronic copies of each of your final month end sum sheets for June forward.

They want to answer the customer within a week, so they'll need this information at least by early next week.  Kent has requested that all of the information be sent to both him and Tim.

Thanks for your help!

I sent to Kevin the names forwarded to us from Paul for possible panelists from Western governors' offices for FERC's November 2 Energy Infrastructure conference in Seattle.  From the financial community, I sent him the name of Leonard Hyman.  Andy Vesey (the person on Jim's Barton subcommittee panel) suggested Leonard as a possible speaker.  I also spoke with Margaret Morgan (Price Waterhouse and and an EPSA member) to see if she has any ideas, and she too suggested Leonard.  She says Leonard is very knowledgeable about California issues and would be a good speaker.  Margaret is checking with colleagues to see if they have any other recommendations.  I'll keep you posted.

I got a call back from Ed Peck over the weekend.  He said that he didn't
know where the BLM guy got his numbers, but that $1MM/mile for ROW would be
extremely steep.  He said that he has heard about the rumored price Kinder
Morgan Sonoran might have to pay, said it was pretty astronomical, but not
near that expensive.  We still haven't spoken directly to eachother (just
voice mail).  He said that he was down meeting with "Octar?" last week and
will be meeting with "Octar" again Tuesday 9/25 in Gallup.  He acted as
though most anyone I'm speaking with at Transwestern should know who "Octar"
is.  I have another call back into him - is there anything specific you
would like me to ask him?  He said that most folks at Transwestern should
have a pretty good idea of what ROW costs should be on Navajo. Ed just
called.  He said that Octar is the Navajo Director of Minerals and that Ed,
Louis Soldano, and Johnny McGee just finished negotiating the renewal of the
twin mainlines and the San Juan Lateral through 2009 with Octar - it was
$30MM.  He said that they brought up the possibility of a new line with
Octar, and that he thought it would be something similar for the new line.

FYI.  Hirsch apparently is a business reporter for the Times who got my name from people.  He's doing a story about the contracts.  Something like "they bought way too much for too high a price.  Now what?"  I told him that I would talk to him under the following conditions:
No attribution to Enron specifically
No attribution of the "unnamed sources" sort, "industry sources" or sort, etc.
If, when the story's further along, he wants to try to get a quote from us, I'd put him in touch with our PR folks.
We talked generally about DWR, the CA Power Authority, the contracts, the Edison deal with the PUC, etc.
More specifically, he asked me "are there any alternatives to deal with this mess."  I outlined the following proposal, which we've talked about internally, and which we've been quietly shopping behind the scenes.  I did not bring up the "green only" DA for small customers piece of the proposal (slipped my mind).
I also gave him names of other folks I thought he should talk to.  He said he might get back to me.  If he calls back, I'll let you know.
Please let me know if anyone has any concerns 1) about talking to him on a backgound only basis, and/or 2) the proposal outlined below. Thanks.
Best,
Jeff

Good mark ups.  Thanks.
Originally, I purposely excluded acknowledging the need for a forum to develop non-physical/pure financial standards.  I was not sure if this was an issue we could win buy-in from other marketers that NERC establish business practices.
However, on the EPSA-NAERO Working Group conference call today, one member suggested we alert NERC and FERC to the fact that "business practices" have the hardest impact on the marketers and IPPs.  And if NERC is going there - then the likes of EPSA and ELCON become the major staekholders in that forum.  I think this is a great twist to the old "reliablity first approach" of NERC  and can give us major leverage.  I will bolster this point in the write-up.
EPSA will draft a letter to be sent to Mike Gent explaining what EPSA members support.  It will be based upon a "checklist" of issues similar to this write-up.  I would like to get this write-up into Mark Bennett's hands to incorporate into the letter and see if other EPSA members can support it.  We may still want to send this write-up directly to Dave Nevius and Mike Gent since, they approached us directly.
Additionally, EPSA members agreed that we should continue the parallel development of EISB and NERC.  But - take an active role in the formation of the 4th quadrant of EISB.  DOE has offered to host a forum for an industry effort to kick-start the 4th quadrant.  Mark Bennett has been talking with Rae McQuade at GISB and she told him that NERC, as an organization, cannot be folded under the EISB umbrella.  FERC would have liked such a simple solution, they want the expertise/experience of NERC - and the fair process of GISB.  So, the challenge is
a) migrate the NERC expertise into the EISB, or
b) transform the NERC structure into an EISB like structure
NERC is proceeding at Warp Factor 10 in making a transition into the new One-Stop Shop. EPSA members believe that NERC leading this charge will certainly result in the marketers geting the short endf as we did with the Blue Ribbon Panel of a few years ago.  EPSA members want an open and inclusive forum for shaping the new organization.  That is the justification for participating in the DOE sponsored forum - to challenge NERC leading this charge.  This concern will also be expressed in the EPSA letter.

Extra!  What happens when the markets reopen?  As leaders work to prevent a political and psychological crisis from turning into a financial one, history offers the only real guide on what to expect when the smoke clears.  By Jon D. Markman

If you go way back, it was 139 years ago next week that Gen. Robert E. Lee and his Confederate troops engaged the Union Army at Antietam, Md., in a battle that turned out to be the single bloodiest day in U.S. history. More than 26,000 soldiers from both sides were killed or wounded on that Sept. 17, 1862 -- a figure that will probably be eclipsed by the carnage of Sept. 11, 2001.  That attack, the first major thrust north by the surprisingly powerful Southern rebels, led President Abraham Lincoln to issue his Emancipation Proclamation * and open a new chapter in American civil and business life, a new era of liberty for people and markets.  Likewise have most major events in U.S. economic history led to consequences unimagined by key actors at the time. And so it will probably be with this attack. Sources across the country told me Tuesday that they believe that the unexpected consequence over the next few days and months could be a stock-market rally led first by promises by the Federal Reserve to provide all necessary funds to staggered banks and brokerages and next by vast deficit spending by Congress to shore up the countrys defenses.  Michael Stutzer, professor of finance at the University of Iowa, points out that Tuesdays events were a civil and emotional crisis, not a financial crisis. An emotional crisis, he said, can lead to a financial crisis only if mishandled by government authorities. *A financial crisis is what happened in Japan, where people learned that not only were all the stocks they held were overvalued but that their government had a hand in leading their banks to bankruptcy,* he said. *Nothing like that is happening here. But what does have to happen now is that the Fed must act to prevent a contagion of fear from spreading and leading people to withdraw money and stop buying things. That would lead to a recession and thus to a real financial emergency.*

A few predictions What are the likely immediate consequences when the U.S. markets reopen later this week or next?  Anthony Kolton, chief executive of Markethistory.com in Chicago, has researched the past 100 years of events that led the United States into war. He forecasts with confidence that the major indexes will open with losses of 5%, then quickly recover by the end of the following trading week to remain unchanged at pre-catastrophe levels. *If there is a big opening plunge, I think youll see a total recovery over the next five days,* he said from Manhattan.   Kolton, who was en route to a meeting at the World Trade Center when the buildings were hit, said he also believes that the United States does not face a financial crisis just because the buildings that were destroyed stood at the center of U.S. financial life. The reason: After the 1993 bombing of the buildings, he says, most companies spent millions to build disaster recovery systems and back up all their accounting far off site. *Were going to recover,* he said.  Steve Milner, managing partner of the worldwide financial planning firm Squar Milner in Newport Beach, Calif., said he is most worried about the consumer, not business. Based on conversations with clients, he believes that people will react with fear -- and fearful people rein in their spending on everything from vacations to home remodeling and stocks. That will be a real, not an imagined, economic event, he believes, that could badly damage a U.S. economy that is already sputtering.  Milner also notes that many major financial institutions that he does business with were already inclined to be sellers of the recent decline, not buyers. But that could turn around. *People who were inclined to sell might be more inclined to sell now * but I doubt it,* he said. *There is a cynical part of me that says financial professionals will realize that life goes on and will decide to be buyers.*  Vic Niederhoffer, a longtime trader for financier George Soros and his own accounts, says that he also believes that a big down market will find buyers. *I really hate to sound mercenary, but I have received many messages from traders who say that they think this will be a terrific opportunity to buy. Whether you look at the John F. Kennedy assassination, the Eisenhower heart attack, the Warren G. Harding ptomaine poisoning or airline crashes, usually disasters provide the greatest times of opportunity,* he said.  Niederhoffer, a student of economic history, said that in the past disasters have led to a tremendous boost for local and national economies as capital infrastructure gets rebuilt with the most modern equipment. Those two buildings alone will require massive outlays of funds * possibly provided by the Fed or Congress from the U.S. Treasury * to build miles of new fiber-optic lines, buy the latest data-transmission switches, and possibly tens of thousands of new computers and software.  *Everyone will chip in to help and this will turn out to be a transitory event,* Niederhoffer said. *It may cause a temporary slowdown in the U.S. economy and a big disruption in the supply chain, but there is no evidence that declines in products or earnings or commerce have anything to do with stock prices anyway. In fact, there is no evidence to suggest that stocks do any worse in recessions than they do in better times.*  Mr. P, a hedge fund trader that I have quoted in past columns, said he likewise believes that the first days move could set a bottom to the market. *This is very bad for bonds, very good for stocks,* he said. *This act of war, with the magnitude of the loss of life, will lead Congress to engage in deficit spending like the world has never seen -- selling billions of dollars of new government bonds to cope both with the reconstruction of New York and the build-up of the American military.*

Always, history offers perspective So what if these scenarios dont pan out? The global financial system was already in bad shape before Tuesday and sellers of stocks were swamping buyers with growing intensity. If worried investors decide to put all their personal funds in a lockbox and the Fed and Congress stand aside, you could look to the last major financial crises for the floor in the market.   The October 1987 crash left the Nasdaq at 323 at its nadir, a level reached again four years later in October 1990 at the moment of greatest panic over oil supplies during the Gulf War against Iraq. If the markets had risen from there in a straight line that approximated the historic 6% return of stocks, that index would be at around 690 today instead of 1,680.   That could be a real floor, but its unlikely to transpire if authorities do their job and thus avoid the fate that befell Gen. George McClellan two months after Antietam. President Lincoln replaced him with Ambrose E. Burnside after complaining about McClellans failure to press his advantage after victory. His comment: *If you dont want to use the Army, I should like to borrow it for awhile.* The Bush administration likewise has a vast set of financial weapons at its disposal to battle this assault, and the public will replace it if used unwisely and too slowly.

Hi all,

We spoke to Rick Simpson in Hertzberg's office who related the
following:

The last meeting of Senate, Assembly, and Governor's staff was last
Wednesday.  The Senate staff has been advised that the Governor is not
interested in having a bill that could only pass the Senate.  He wants
one that can get 41 votes in the Assembly as well, which means direct
access would have to be included.  Rick spoke to Brian Kelly of Burton's
office on Friday.  Brian said they are working on securitizing the
interest costs.  They are looking at something like 50-60 kw for the
core/non-core number which would still be able to be financed even with
fewer customers, although the transaction costs would be higher with a
smaller customer base.  I asked Rick if they expect all of their members
to return and he said most of them would.  I suggested that it had
better be the right ones, or they'd have trouble getting to 41 votes.
He said he wasn't sure at this point if a compromise bill could be ready
by next Tuesday, but the Assembly is willing to try with the right bill.

I spoke to John Burton a few minutes ago who reiterated that he will not
look favorably upon including direct access although he understands that
some business democrats in the Assembly need it to vote for a
bailout.    He said he spoke to an Assembly leader this morning who told
him that even 78xx would get only 36 votes today if it came up for a
vote (it squeeked through on 41).  He is considering putting up 78xx for
a vote on Tuesday (it will fail) and continuing discussions with the
Governor's office after that.  He said to tell you all that the bailout
bill can't pass next week because it interferes with Scott and Gayle's
wedding on the 14th, and coincidentally that is the last day for the
Governor to sign or veto bills.

Hi Everybody.

You may find yourself running into to two new employees here in the San Francisco office.

Dennis Yee has taken up residency in the back, by the EES printer/fax at extension 7852.  He was in the San Ramon office, but decided to make his new
home here with us in SF. Dennis is a construction manager with the Enron Facility Services group (EFS).

Also, Anthony Barr will be tackling the task of working for me as my new clerk, please stop by and give him your condolences.  He will be sitting in the cube
directly behind me, and his extension is 7818.

Please stop by and introduce yourself to both.

Thanks,

SUBJECT :::: Meeting with Edison (John Fielder) re: Getting Edison to Pay Us What We're Owed for the PX Credit

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Talked to John Fielder (SVP at the utility) this morning in an attempt to determine if Edison will come around and pay us the PX credit they owe us.
Summary of our offer:
Edison pays us 90% of what they owe us as of 01.17.01.
Payment structure: Edison pays us 10% immediately, with an agreed to (speedy) payment schedule for the remaining 90%.
In return, we drop our complaint against Edison at the PUC.
In return, we agree to a bottoms-up approach retroactive to March 1 to replace the current PX Credit/Residual CTC framework.
Fielder said that he didn't see any show-stoppers in our proposal, but had to check back on his end.  However, there were three additional issues that he wanted to add to any deal:
Some agreement regarding payment of Edison's undercollection (this would cover any of our DA customers who were bundled services customers pre-January 17). We agreed that this would only be an issue to the extent that the Legislature and/or the PUC agreed that Edison should get authority to recoup its undercollection in rates.
Some agreement on DWR stranded costs.  John expressed the view that DWR bought power under the assumption that the customers who've recently gone DA would be there to take the power, and now that they've left, they should contribute in some way to any stranded costs. I told John that this issue is a hornet's nest, that we were better off leaving it out, but we'd consider his proposals.
Some agreement on forebearance.  I told John that if Edison agrees to pay us, it didn't seem that forebearance would be off the table.
We agreed to touch base at the same time Wednesday morning.  The idea is that he'll get back to me with Edison's reaction to our proposal; and we'd get back to him on Edison's proposals.
Might be useful to determine whether we want to continue the discussions.  While John seemed very inclined to work something out, all signals are that the Legislature isn't inclinded to bail Edison out next week.  In which case, Edison could be in bankruptcy in a couple of weeks, which would presumably nullify any agreement we might reach with them. On the other hand, if the Legislature pulls a rabbit out of a hat, an agreement might have real value.
Any comments folks have on 1) Edison's proposals and 2) whether it makes sense to continue discussions on Wednesday are appreciated.  Seems that, at a minimum, if we agree to consider Edison's proposals, then our payment should go from 90 cents to 100 cents on the dollar.

I spoke with the "WebMeister" of the Colorado PUC today.  He did not think that the PUC would post on its website the filings by other parties in this docket.  He could only find one other party's filing (People's) and didn't see any other comments on file, either in the data base or on other analyst's desks.  I will continue to check with him.  The hearing is scheduled November 1.

Significant issues raised in People's comments are as follows:

Rules should be revised to include a Fixed Gas Cost option (without true-up) in addition to a traditional PGA-type offering - However the comments did not address administrative problems or cross-subsidization issues.
Rules did not go far enough in assuring utilties that hedging costs will be recoverable through the GCA
The calculation of interest on underrecoveries should be allowed.  Currently the interest calculation is asymmetrical.

That's the process we agreed to follow last week to vet the contract interpretation points, but my concern is that Diomedes will be in Houston tomorrow and I believe he plans to call Ken to complain.  The immediate action item for this group is to figure out whether there is a satisfactory explanation we can give Diomedes now or, if not, someone needs to call Ken asap and let him know to expect a phone call from Diomedes.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I just participated in a joint defense conference call with in-house and outside counsel in this matter.  I was not given notice of the call until a moment or two before it occurred.  We plan to have another such call next Thursday, at the same time.  In a nutshell,

1.  All the defendants want to retain our outside counsel (Lazaro Garza-Gongora) as their outside counsel.  I told them that I had no problem with that so long as, in the event of a conflict, which I did not anticipate, my clients got to keep him.  Of course, I am assuming that his fees and expenses would be apportioned among us.  No one seemed to have a problem with that, but I need to follow it up in writing.  I also anticipate a joint defense agreement.

2. The answer date for Enron Corp. and Intratex (Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. has not to our knowledge been served) is Monday, November 5.  Although Lazaro hasn't called me back yet about his review of the Court's file, which he told me last week he would do, the attorneys on the conference call reportedly represented all the named defendants, and no one had an earlier answer date.

3. I was asked to ask Lazaro to ask for an extension of time on behalf of all the defendants until and including December 5 to move, answer or otherwise plead.  I have a call in to Lazaro to discuss that approach.  Query whether we want to agree to respond at the same time on behalf of EGM if EGM hasn't been served.

4.  During the conference call, a number of factual, legal and strategy issues were discussed.  Foremost among them was getting this case dismissed before merits discovery commenced.  This would obviously be a home run in this case; also, it would prevent Grynberg from getting his hands on documents that he would then pretend to have known about all along in his qui tam action, bolstering his original source argument.  Also discussed was the following:

a.  No one could articulate a good removal theory, although there was much discussion.  Unlike the Quinque case, there is no offshore gas involved here.  Further, there was considerable concern that if the case was removed, Grynberg would try to get it MDL'd, so that the MDL court would hear the remand argument.  There was a concern about that, given the MDL Court's view of Northern's removal in the Quinque case.

b.  Motions for change of venue.  One basis might be that because, among other things, of the plaintiffs' anticipated argument that they were representing the schoolchildren of Zapata County, defendants may not be able to get a fair trial in Zapata County.

c.  A plea to the jurisdiction, challenging the standing of RSM to make this claim.  There is a fundamental ambiguity in the pleadings, which is that the suit purports to be both one for the collection of delinquent ad valorem taxes, and one for damages based on fraud, etc.

d.  Why the petition mentions "Other counties".  I raised the possibility of communitized or unitized leases with wells in adjacent counties; another thought was that this was an invitation to other county school boards to intervene.  I also mentioned that I did not interpret the petition to include the State of Texas as a party, but that it was not entirely clear.  Others agreed about the poor draftsmanship, but the concensus is that the State of Texas (which apparently cannot collect ad valorem taxes anyway) is not a party or being represented as such by RSM.

e.  I raised the possibility of a motion to abate, based on the pending Quinque case, which purports to be a class action on behalf of, among others, taxing authorities.  The concensus was that this was not a good idea, primarily because it would force us to concede that plaintiffs were in fact adequately represented in Quinque, where they are not parties, and where we are vigorously contesting class certification.

f. An argument based on lack of indispensable parties, to include all the actual Zapata County taxpayers who haven't paid enough.

I will continue to keep you advised.  I assume I am reporting to everyone who needs to be in the loop; if that is not correct, please let me know.

Britt

Steve,

I spoke with Knight of Philchem about other potentially responsible Baytank entities.  He was not aware of any.  Knight was anxious to confirm that since I was telling him Enron was filing suit against Philchem and was not telling him we were filing suit against Philchem, that we would not sue Philchem.  I told him that I could not tell him one way or another on that.  Knight was unhappy about that, but resigned.

I have also spoke twice with David See of Baytank about getting an extension of time to file suit.  See told me that neither his president nor the lady who knows about the claim were available, so he, with apologies, couldn't give me an extension of time to file suit, and understood that I would be filing suit tomorrow afternoon.

I did tell See that I would consider giving Baytank an extension of time to answer.

I will go forward with filing suit tomorrow afternoon, assuming that I hear of no objections from any other Enron entity to my filing suit.

Britt

New Orleans at St. Louis: Kurt Warner's endorsement of Campbell's

This unfortunate case of "faucet ass" forces Warner to leave the

Oops, I Crapped My Pants.

The fan is shown three cars and in order to win he must correctly

He is in good spirits, all things considered.  For example, I asked how he
was doing and he said "Terrible!  All three of my fantasy football teams
lost, and I've got a tumor exploding in my head!"  He's being moved into
private room today, so personal visits, flowers, and phone calls will be
welcome.  The main number is 210-575-4040.  Just ask for Ernst.

As of today, the surgery is scheduled for Wednesday early afternoon.

Remember to say a prayer at noon tomorrow....that's UT (aka central) time,
for those of you who have moved away.

I don't have anything to add to John, there was no mention if ESC, OASIS II, seams issues, etc. at the Stakeholder Committee meeting on Monday.

I am cc: Jose and Richard to jog their memories.  If you guys recall anything about the discussion, please let Mark and I know.

I do however, want to tell you about the conversation I just had with Dave Nevius.  He called me to check the Enron concerns about the ESC resolutions as expressed by Andy Rodriquez' email.

Dave reverted to the fact that the sector voting model was language added at the request of John Anderson and Vann Prater.  I explained to him that those words were needed as an add on to salvage what we could.  If NERC was going to adopt the resolutions 7-9 concerning the ESC, John's concern (and I agree with him) was that the ESC structure doesn't work.  I think you agree as well given the response to the joint TCCG request to Gent last year re: membership on the ESC.  The intent of the additional language was to make the best of a bad situation.  If the ESC was going to be roped into NERC, it should at least adopt the new voting structure.

This may be useful info. for you.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Dear Family,

Please see the attached schedules for preseason and regular games for the
Houston Rockets through November.  Because we all have very busy lives and
find it impossible to confirm too far in advance, I will wait closer to each
game before distributing tickets.  Also, Ken's schedule is a moving target
and it would make it much easier for him to squeeze in at least one game
this year, if we could do it on shorter notice.  Our eight basketball seats
are amazing and the tickets are a hot item, so hopefully everyone will try
to make this work and have fun doing it.

I will wait at least seven days before each game to distribute the tickets.
If you have any interest in pre-selecting certain games that you definitely
want to attend, please advise me and I will put your name on the list with
an * next to it.  Additionally, if you think you know your schedule and
would like to be considered in the ticket distribution for certain games, I
will put your name on the list with a ? next to your name.  Once your name
is on the list and as each game gets closer, I would appreciate it if you
would contact me ASAP when you find out that you are unable to attend.
Everyone has said that they want to be fair and rotate, so that each family
member has a shot at attending a game and getting both kinds of tickets.
Hopefully, we can all work it out.  However, in the event that we have more
requests than tickets for the same game, and we are unable to settle it, I
will have Barb pull names out of a hat.  Once you confirm your attendance,
tickets can be put in an envelope with your name on them and sent down to
the doorman at the Huntingdon for you to pick up.

For any games where our immediate family is not able to use the tickets,
they will be distributed to other lucky recipients in a rotating order.  I
will have Barb draw your names and ours out of a hat to create the rotation.
If you have other family members or someone special that you would like to
offer tickets to, let me know.  I can either contact you and have you
contact them or you can give me their names and contact information and Barb
will contact them directly, as you wish.

In the event that I am traveling or cannot be reached, please contact Barb
as she will be copied in on all current schedules and have access to the
tickets.  GO ROCKETS!

Love, Mom/Linda

The neighbor was concerned, "That's an awfully big hole for a goldfish, isn't it?"

Amy patted down the last heap of earth then replied, "That's because he's inside your damn cat."

Jeff:  I sent this last week but didn't have your email address correct.  I
understand from Sunita that my expense report is still pending your
approval.  I'll be happy to call or stop by to explain if there is a
problem.  If there is not a problem, I would appreciate your approval
soon---I paid Amex several weeks ago and would appreciate reimbursement.

Hope all is well and that things settle down inside Enron---sounds bad from
the outside.

Jeff:  Sunita (my former assistant in Dubai)has recently submitted an
expense report for your approval.  She will be submitting another one next
month when additional Amex bills are processed (Amex is slower in Dubai than
in the US).  I thought you might appreciate an explanation for the major
items.

1.  Most of the big items relate to a trip in October for my wife and I to
come to Dubai to pack up our stuff (as envisioned and agreed in my
separation arrangements.)  Part of the airline charges were on this month's
Amex;  the rest (along with related hotel & travel expenses) will be on next
month's.

2.  There are some trailing charges for August expenses while I was still
employed (for example, a rental car for my last 2 weeks in Houston closing
out office affairs, some lunches/dinners for former employees who had worked
for me, phone/fax related to close-out etc

3.  Finally, there will be several lunches/dinners related to my current
visit to Dubai.  When I arrived in Dubai last week, Darrin Donegan told me
that a former Enron employee that has chosen to stay in the region is
apparently bitter and is creating some potential problems for Enron.  I told
him that I would be happy to visit with some of my former key contacts to
help set the record straight and ensure that Enron continues to be viewed in
the best light possible.

Hope all is well with you--I'm looking forward to tomorrow's earnings
report.

All the best,

Rick

Looks like it should work, but it has fed three times since sept. Bone
yard

7
stands are working and he filled them up.

his friends shot lots of doves at the trailer sun evening. Zander said
his

Chris said they were swarming around the trailer at sunset. Chris hunted

lone star brush pile sun evening, missed a spike and a turkey. saw a
good
deer walking out.

Below is a summary of my discussion w/ Norman Abood (General Counsel for GAF) in response to our termination letter dated 10/16/01 and his written response on 10/17.  Basically, I told Norman it was time to stop the paper trail and either get down to closing or go our separate ways.  I emphasized our primary concerns as follows:

1.  GAF's ability to fund its equity
2.  finalizing the feedstock supply and products off-take
3.  Morgan's commitment to finance the debt
4.  defining the pool of assets to be collateralized
5.  evidence of insurability, and
6.  restructuring of GAF's PSA w/ Farmland.

I also emphasized our frustration over the "continually moving targets" (debt, collateral, equity, feedstocks, etc...) and told him I will NOT continue to expend resources and time playing games.  Finally, I told him I was willing to re-engage on the following terms:

a.  GAF submit either a written set of comments to our 9/21 MOU or a counter-proposal to us by Monday, 10/22.
b.  If, subject to OUR review and based on US believing there's merit to proceed that we get ALL PARTIES (GAF, 	     Morgan Stanley and EGM) together and hammer out a definitive and final version of the MOU including, but not 		     limited to the primary concerns above (w/ all parties having "subject to senior management and/or Board approval" 	     language/conditions).  The purpose here is to get all the T&C down in writing with everyone in the room in 	     conceptual agreement which will make it more difficult for the targets to move.
c.  Morgan Stanley must be willing to sign some form of commitment letter evidencing their willingness to finance the 	     transaction.

GAF will then have some finite/specific period of time in which to approach Farmland and restructure their deal as necessary to close the transaction.

Norman agreed in principle and committed to get back to us by tomorrow.  Hopefully, this will once and for all define whether or not this deal can get done.

Richard,
This will acknowledge receipt of and thank you for the above-referenced referral.  You told me that we were to act as first-chair trial counsel in this matter, and instructed me to retain local counsel immediately.
On the recommendation of Susman & Godfrey and Willy Wood of Fulbright & Jaworski, and with Jim Derrick's authority, I am happy to report that I have retained Lazaro Garza-Gongora of Laredo as local counsel for us in this matter, at his usual hourly rate of $175, and a retainer of $5,000, to be applied by him against his fees and expenses.   By acting quickly on this, we eliminated the risk of the remaining defendants snapping up all available local counsel and being forced to beg for a share of one.  I would of course be willing to consider sharing Lazaro (and his fees) with other defendants, but with the understanding that in the event of a conflict, Lazaro would only represent us, and would be allowed to stay in the case.
I anticipate that there will be a comprehensive joint defense agreement in this matter and that both local counsel and experts, including gas measurement experts, may be shared.  I will be speaking with you shortly about retaining a gas measurement expert.
Lazaro is going to the courthouse to review the court's file and will report shortly on what he finds.
Please let me know how you want Lazaro's bills handled.
Please let me know who needs to be in the reporting loop on this one.
As always, we greatly appreciate the chance to work with you.
I will keep you closely advised.
Britt

Janet / Danny,
We do have Rafael on our radar screen as a loan program participant.
Ted and Traci have been visiting with him, and plan to talk to him when he comes to Houston in November.  FYI - he wants to return to Enron as a Manager, not an Associate.  Additional background - he was an Analyst for a year in London, was promoted to Associate and went back to Columbia for his MBA two years later.
I don't know the individual, but given 2 years as an Associate - he may be a Manager candidate.  His visits with the business units in November should prove it out.

After a brief discussion with Greek regarding our consolidated return-to-accrual impact, he has suggested that Sr. Specialists and above that were involved in either the year-end accrual or the return review process meet with him tomorrow to discuss our respective RTA adjustments.  Michelle Thompson and I will be preparing a summary schedule tonight of the "material" issues that we believe Greek may address tomorrow.  Please refer to the original schedule that Michelle sent and be prepared to discuss any RTA adjustments that could your P&L.   In the interim, please call if you have any questions.

Thanks,

Andy. I do not know who Gordon is nor his connections with the rest of the ESC group so I cannot gage the effect of your proposed e-mail to him. This is what I know:
The BOT wanted some immediate action, the NERC staff was under pressure (criticism) at the meeting. The inclusion of the ESC mention was an attempt to latch-on to some positive development. NERC wanted to be linked with it and not be left out, (where this effort may be re-directed to EISB for continuation)  Some stakeholders smelled a rat, and wanted to link NERC's link to this effort to a new committee voting structure; therefore  items 7, 8, and 9 were modified to reflect these comments,  and this is how the resolution came out below (see below).
The next step will be at FERC to decide how the OASIS 2 work is to continue and under whose leadership. It may not be under the existing ESC group or a reformulation of it.
Next week (Tuesday)  I would like to review all the interconnected issues so that we provide guidance to ESPA
Jose
Resolution on the Role of NERC in Developing Market Interface or Commercial Practice Standards
(Board Agenda Item 20)
WHEREAS, Reliability standards developed by NERC, relying on the expertise of industry experts, have been the basis for the reliable operation of the bulk electric systems in North America for over 30 years; and
WHEREAS, With the opening of the transmission systems, the vertical disaggregating of the former monopoly utilities, and the introduction of marketers and independent power producers, NERC has moved proactively to make its standards process more fair, open, balanced and inclusive; and
WHEREAS, To support the evolution of competitive electricity markets, the formation of large RTOs, and continued reliability and security of interconnected transmission grids, it is vitally important to standardize and make mandatory both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards; and
WHEREAS, NERC has taken a number of proactive steps to deal with the linkages between reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards, including spearheading the OASIS "What" and "How" working groups that developed the Standards and Communications Protocols followed by all transmission providers; formed a Market Interface Committee as a new standing committee of NERC to address the impact of reliability standards on markets and the impact of market practices on reliability; and initiated the formation of and facilitates the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC), which recently filed with FERC a report on their efforts to develop common business practice standards for electronic scheduling (OASIS Phase 2); and
WHEREAS, the electric business practice standards being developed by the Electronic Scheduling Collaborative (ESC) are a complement to the new NERC Reliability Model on which NERC's future Organization Standards will be based; and
WHEREAS, NERC is recognized and respected as the industry's developer of standards for the reliable planning and operation of interconnected transmission grids throughout North America, and
WHEREAS, the Board of Trustees recognizes the urgent need for uniform wholesale electric business practice standards that are well coordinated with reliability standards; and
WHEREAS, the NERC Stakeholders Committee has expressed a strong preference for a single organization to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards;
BE IT THEREFORE RESOLVED, that NERC:
1.	Take all necessary steps to become the single organization in North America to develop both reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards through a fair, open, balanced, and inclusive process, and to file such standards with FERC and appropriate government agencies in Canada.
2.	Actively solicit cooperation, collaboration, and support from Canadian and U.S. government entities to establish NERC as the single organization in North America for the development of reliability standards and wholesale electric business practice standards.
3.	Take immediate action to adopt and implement the six Initial Recommendations of the Standing Committee Representation Task Force contained in Board Agenda Item 22.
4.	Facilitate - jointly with interested trade associations; federal, state, and provincial regulators; and other stakeholder organizations - an open and inclusive process to achieve consensus on the definitions and attributes of the functions necessary for the development of wholesale electric industry standards and practices, and on a course of action to institute such capabilities.
5.	Interface with state and provincial regulators to address retail operational issues that may affect wholesale electric operations.
6.	Build on the results of activities to date regarding the new Reliability Model and new Organization Standards Development Process.
7.	Recommend that FERC use the ESC report, which has already been submitted to FERC, as the basis for a notice of proposed rulemaking on electric business practice standards.
8.	Urge FERC to make use of the ESC, which will use the new sector weighted voting model approved by the NERC Board, for further development of wholesale electric business practice standards, including standards necessary for certain aspects of RTO design such as congestion management and ancillary services.
9.	Commit to continuing to support the work of the ESC until such time as an industry consensus is achieved on how to develop wholesale electric business practice standards within the NERC framework.

Sara -

At the point the language was agreed to in the below agreement we may not
have been aware of the regulatory contraints under PUHCA that does not allow
for the inclusion of Affiliates under Set-Off (we may actually have to amend
that agreement to carve it out).

With respect to the our ISDA, I will make sure to forward to Anthony the
provision in question and ask him when he has some availability to get on a
call in the beginning of next week to discuss.

Hi gang!
Hope all is well with you all.  Just thought I'd give you all an update on
our new home, that is if all the inspections go smoothly.  It's in Browns
Pt., 4602 41st St. to be exact, it's described as a super clean rambler, new
carpet, vaulted ceilings with fireplace in living room, kitchen has
nook,island, family rm, big fenced backyard which seems well landscaped to
my standards anyway.  It has 3 bedrooms, 2 baths, 2 car garage w/ opener!
We'll be closer to family, friends,Steve's work & hopefully have a better
sense of community for Queen Isabel.  We're excited to say that we're just
outside Tuscany, which is where a beautiful community lies with $300k & up
homes.  Can't wait to have you all over to unpack, clean, paint, babysit &
mow the lawn, so mark your calendars for Nov. 30th! This is also Steve's
34th birthday, hmmmm I think I'll buy him a house, don't ruin the surprise.
Take care,
Jennifer

Bubba,

Don't talk to Patro that way.  He is a friend  of mine.  That girl he was speaking to at the Astros game was his  daughter.  He can't help that she is taller than him.  That doesn't  make him any less a man......or does it?

My update......I'm living in New Jersey,  married 9 years with two boys, six and three.  I work in  Manhattan for NIKE.  I'm the East Coast Baseball Field Rep. dealing with  agents and athletes.  I guess you could say that I give away free stuff to  millionaires while I am looking for the next Jeter/Griffey/A-Rod/etc.  I  actually get paid to go to Yankee and Shea Stadiums and interact with the  athletes, watch baseball games. and read the sports section.  Someone  has to do it.

I know what you are thinking and the answer is  no.  I won't get you free shoes.

Hope every is well.  Glad to see the Phi Delt  love being passed along.  The best place to send me a message is at work at  mike.cavers@nike.com  or home at  cooperscloset@msn.com .

Ken, Greg and Mark,
I wanted to provide you a suggested agenda for the rescheduled Management Conference.  After working with Joannie Williamson to coordinate open dates on your calendars with hotel availability, here is what we are proposing:
Location:   Westin La Cantera Resort, San Antonio (The Woodlands still will not have enough rooms to hold our group in February.  We are concerned that if we don't have people committed to stay over, especially on a weekend, we risk weak participation.  Also, by rebooking with the Starwood property, we hope to potentially recoup some of the loss incurred by canceling our November date and maintain a positive relationship with the company.)
Dates:   Friday, February 22 and Saturday, February 23 (We received feedback that employees may not appreciate being asked to sacrifice a weekend right now.  However, these are the dates that the hotel is available.  Available dates the previous week would interfere with Valentines Day and coincide with the peak of the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City.)
Agenda:
DAY 1		Friday, February 22
2pm - 5pm	Registration
6pm - 9pm	Reception and Chairman's Dinner
Speaker:  General Norman Schwarzkopf  (The General is currently available on this date, but has not accepted the engagement.  I feel that, if we can 		reschedule him, he would be a significant draw to ensure people arrive in time for the evening activities.)
DAY 2		Saturday, February 23
8am - 2pm	Business Agenda  (I will keep Ken and the brief business unit presentations/panel on the agenda.  I also hope to reschedule Gary Hamel.  Otherwise, I will		remain flexible on the agenda.)
2pm		Meeting Adjourns
No planned activities  (The activities are perceived as an unnecessary extravagance at this time.)
We'd like to issue a memo about postponing the Management Conference to invitees as soon as possible.  While details on the agenda can be resolved later, please let me know if you are comfortable with the dates and location so we can include that information in the memo.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I've been talking to other ESPs about the PX Credit Payment and the Barnett proceeding.  Some tidbits:

New West -- wants to keep the payment issues out of the proceeding and wil attempt to do that.  They don't have a complaint filed, so they need SCE to have good faith bilateral settlement discussions.  Good luck there.  Their meeting with SCE is 11/6.

New Energy -- New Energy returned all customers (but one) before May 2000. The one customer -- Krogers (grocery store chain) -- has been very active at the Legislature on this and will attend the SCE meeting. No meeting has been set up but one is expected next week. Has been more willing to talk about "cost shifting" but thinks SCE's proposal is ludicrous. I suggested it would be a bad idea to go down SCE's cost shifting road right now. Is outraged by SCE's proposal.

APSES --  Is outraged by SCE's proposal. Told SCE he wouldn't meet until SCE gives him the proposed payment amount and substantiation for it. He believes that SCE has no way to determne an accurate number.  He will also insist that SCE true-up the amount, once the ISO hits the utilities with the underscheduling penalty.  And finally, he will insist that SCE complete the PX Credit audit before he'll agree to a number.  APSES is the other party with a complaint filed at the Commission. His new contracts put his customers at risk for changes to the PX Credit mechanism, so his issue is primarily collecting the past amount due.

Strategic Energy -- Only does business in San Diego.

Commonwealth -- Minimal exposure.

Dear Bob,
I think you are doing all the fiji guys a great service by continuing to
promote this email talk center.  Keep up the good work.  I rarely have time
to converse with all of ya'll, but I do keep up with what's going on by
reading the emails ya'll send.  Would you do me a favor?
Please notify all that i use another email address now more often than this
one.  It is OUTLAWIN@bellsouth.net
Also, this past Saturday night I had my first baby.  It was a boy 7 lbs 10.4
ozs and 20.75" long.  I am very excited and his name is Jake.  Please pass
the word for me.
Thanks,
Outlaw
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I wonder how much the 'Stately Oak' grew during the past year? Oops! My bad!
I almost forgot that it was mysteriously cut down during an early '80's FIJI
Island pre-decorating/design phase. Has anyone ever fessed up to the
slaying? It sure did cause a terrible stir! If I remember correctly, the
cabinet considered canceling the Island unless the culprit confessed! This
may be a good topic of discussion? Maybe we could solve the mystery once and
for all?
And Bone, the arrest was a major event for at least three of us, me, Curt
and Tan Dan who came to court the next morning to bail us out! If that
arrest didn't make it, maybe the one when I got arrested for disturbing the
peace in Tiger Stadium during the '81 homecoming game against Fla. St. did?
At least the cops didn't beat me as bad as FSU beat the football team that
night! Or maybe Dan's 1st DWI made it? I'll let Dan tell that story.
Hope all you guys are doing well!

Brothers,   (Oct. 16)
Last night I received orders to report for duty this Thursday for up to 24
months.  As some of you may know, I command a Army Reserve unit in Dallas
TX.   I had just moved to Chicago two weeks ago to take a position within my
company, so this is inconvenient and with a very large pay cut, but I add, I
am very proud to be leading 90 of our finest soldiers into whatever mission
is delivered to us.  Due to operational Security(OPSEC), I can't talk much
about what I do, just keep me and my soldiers in your thoughts, and I will
join you at Pig Dinner 2003 or 2004.

Speaking of Brother Bonin, I'll recount a story during our Hellweek that all
can probably relate to.  Brother Bonin was the assistant Pledge Trainer for
our class in 77-78. Our Hellweek coincided with JamJam and, as slave labor,
we were unloading a truck of tables/chairs at a sorority house. One of the
sorority girls told Brother Bonin that the "pledges" could put the tables in
a certain spot. He corrected the girl by saying they aren't pledges.  When
the girl left, I asked Brother Bonin that if we aren't actives and we aren't
pledges, what are we?  Brother Bonin looked me in the eye and said, "You're
SCUM!"

Lots of news the past couple of weeks.  First, Godspeed to Brother Jeff
Farris.  I know we all wish him a very safe tour.  Second, congrats to the
"Outlaw" for his new baby boy.
Sounds like a lot of people will be in town for Ole Miss--Squid, Tan Dan
(The Worstells) and others.  Let me know who all is coming and maybe we can
all meet some place before or after the game.
Thanks to the 60 Brothers who have signed up for the Yahoo Group.  All the

that once the Commission resolves the free for all issues it will resolve

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Vicki, a few weeks ago a friend of mine, Steve Greenwald (a partner in Davis Wright Tremaine's San Francisco office), called to tell me that one of his clients, Texas-Ohio Energy, Inc., had entered into an agreement with an Enron entity, and was claiming that Enron had breached that agreement.  This client is allegedly preparing to file a petition against us.  Steve told his client that DWT could not represent Texas-Ohio in litigation against Enron, and Steve asked me to try to find out what agreement his client might be talking about (at that time, Steve did not have a copy of the agreement).  Steve asked his client to produce the agreement, and at the same we checked throughout Enron for the agreement (Vicki, you checked around and couldn't find any agreement between EES and Texas-Ohio).  We weren't even sure which Enron entity was involved.  We did kick around my proposal that Steve might be able to serve as a mediator between Texas-Ohio and Enron, to attempt to settle the dispute without litigation.
Now we have the agreement, and it is with EES.  I will send it to you when I get a good-quality copy (which is being sent to me today).  From my almost-illegible faxed copy, It is a Client Commission Agreement between EES and Texas-Ohio, Inc., dated October 13, 2000.  Timonthy J. Hamilton signed as Attorney-in-Fact for EES; there are no lawyers' initials on the execution block.  Texas-Ohio is entitled to recommend to EES prospective commercial and industrial customers served by SoCal, SDG&E, SWG (Southwest Gas), and PG&E.  If EES enters into an agreement with any such identified customers, Texas-Ohio earns a commission.  There are provisions concerning price quoting and commission calculation; I'm sure you are familiar with those.
I am not familiar with this agreement or the extent of its use, and I do not yet know the nature of Texas-Ohio's claim, although I would suspect it is for non-payment of commissions allegedly due.  I will forward the agreement to you, and I'll stand by to help on this, should you want me to.   And Steve Greenwald would be happy to try to broker a peace, if that offer becomes attractive (I'd be happy to introduce you to him, or to work with him, as you wish).
Sheila, this is FYI so that you'll know what's happened on this matter.  It's been a while since we discussed it.  Richard, this is FYI also, inasmuch as this could lead to litigation.
Thank you,

Steve--touching back to a conversation we had two weeks ago, I have set an appointment to meet with Norm Coleman here in Minnesota to go over energy issues and Enron interests.  As a Mayor he has been heavily supported by Xcel (old NSP).  My sense is that he is going to line up along the lines of the Bush administration energy plan.  I'll send an e mail out to all on this list once I have met with him to keep everyone in the loop.

Sue Walden may already have contacted you about the timing on an event hosted by Mr. Lay for Norm in Houston.  The Coleman folks originally had wanted something this month, but it looks like a January or February date is going to work better.

Apparently, there is more of a  customs issue involved here than a consent issue, but some of the mechanics will be similar.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Edison has dripped out information over the last 48 hours that reveals what the team had anticipated for some time:

Edison will pay ESPs what they are owed w.r.t. the negative CTC when they pay everyone else ("sometime in Q1'02").
However, Edison has told us and will tell ESPs today that they intend to very aggressively push the PUC to charge DA customers for "their fair share of the PX credit," since in their view DA customers (through the negative CTC) "contributed to the undercollection no more and no less than bundled customers did."
They claim they are "on the side of the angels" because it is an "equity" issue, and that allowing DA not to pay would be a massive "jailbreak."
Their calculation is simple:  If DA represents 10% of the load, then DA is responsible for paying down 10% of the undercollection.
Edison wants the undercollection recovered over the period of its settlement (they claim that, based on their calculations, they can recover it over 2 years).
In short, Edison is zero-ing out payables tied to negative CTC by forcing ESPs/DA customers to pay it back through rates over the next two years.
In a conversation yesterday, Edison said that it is not attempting to link the two.  That is, they are not making payment of PX-credit-related debt on agreement by ESPs to pay a portion of Edison's undercollection through rates over the next two years.
Presumably, in this way, Edison can say, "We said that we would pay our creditors, and we did.  It was the PUC who sets the rates and decided to claw back by charging ESPs/DA customers as part of the normal course of fulfilling its regulatory responsibilities."

Implications
Clearly negative from the perspective of expeditiously recognizing earnings for amounts Edison says it will pay us when it pays everyone else in Q1.
Equally important, it may increase significantly the risk of recognizing earnings for what PG&E will pay us.  If the PUC addresses whether ESPs/DA customers should contribute to pay down Edison's undercollection, it will likely also want to address the issue for PG&E.  We need to discuss the extent to which the PUC can meddle with PG&E in this regard given that PG&E is pursuing its work out through bankruptcy.

Impact on tomorrow's meeting:
I still think it is constructive to meet face-to-face with Edison tomorrow, but wanted to give folks the option of doing it by conference call:
We still have to determine whether we have agreement on what they owe us.  This includes calculations up to Jan. 17; the period from Jan. 17 to when we put our customers back on bundled service; and the period since they've been returned to DA status.
Since Edison claims they will pay everyone at the same time--sometime in Q1'02--there seems to be some value in determining what that number is, and getting the agreement in writing.
Second, it would be useful to explore with Edison why they have chosen to take an extreme, hardball stance on the issue (given that the PX Credit issues represents about $243MM/~$6B = 4-5% of the total debt).
In addition, it would be useful to let Edison know that they are in for a very long, protracted litigation struggle if, once they've paid us, they attempt to take it back through ratemaking shenanigans at the PUC.
In yesterday's conversation with Fielder, I told him that Edison is ensuring World War 3 and that they'd better prepare for it if they intend to pursue this unreasonable approach. However, I tried to keep things as cordial as possible in an effort not to close down communications altogether.
Other ESPs and DA customers are likely to oppose Edison's proposal.  Sue's informing the ARM coalition of what Edison's up to.

Tom, Diann and Michael,

I gave Peter Ouberg a call but then I read the PG&E rep's answer again ..

I think Tom Heckman misinterpreted what Rod Lee said.  I agree with Rod Lee.  He did not say that Enron could not submit DASRs -- he said we had to have the account on the list and if we did then the DASR would be processed.  If we did not have the account on the list, there would have to be some verification that the contract was signed on or before 9/20/01.  Enron and the other ESPs previously agreed with this approach (although the utilities did not fully buy into it).  I believe Diann submitted the account information, as we had agreed, on Nov 1. I take a little bit of issue with the comment that they will reject DASRs for accounts not on the Nov 1 list until the contract is verified, but I believe it follows the general spirit of what we agreed to at the meeting with ESPs and utilities on Oct 2.

I think Mr. Heckman thought he was being told that he could not add new facilities, but that's not how I read the reply from Mr. Lee.

So, I called Peter Ouberg back and said told him there didn't appear to be a problem after all, but that I would let him know if one cropped up.  IF you would like me to speak to Mr. Heckman, I would be happy to do so.

Just a couple of points that I am not sure I mentioned to you:
1.	I suggested to Glenda in January after Daddy died that she lease the
house with the option to purchase due to the economy in Haleyville.  She
obviouly has not done that.
2.	The day after Daddy died, we went to the bank to get his will to
take to Jeff's office for him to read to us.  Glenda tried to cash in
Daddy's CD at that point and told them that she was the executrix of his
estate.  They refused because she did not have a death certificate and had
not been formally appointed.
3.	Glenda told me that she had told Dr. Cashin that she wanted him to
pay off the note on the purchase of Daddy's practice immediately.  I'm
surprised that he has not since the interest rate on the note is 9%.
With regard to Jeff Mobley wanted to work something out without going to
court, I am fine with that.  However my terms are:
1.	The money in Daddy's checking account, saving account and CD are put
back in to the estate.
2.	The estate 1099's Glenda for the forgiveness of the note.
3.	The value of Daddy's truck that she gave away comes out of her
distribution.
4.	The repayment of the $5,000 that Glenda borrowed from me in April
1996 is repaid to me at 8% annual interest from Glenda's distribution of the
estate.
5.	If the estate is not settled by the first anniversary of Daddy's
death, that an independent third party is appointed administrator.
6.	Any excessive administrative fees paid to Glenda for her work as
executrix of the estate are repaid to the estate.
7.	Glenda agrees in writing to discontinue her harressment of me and my
family.
I am willing to give on the forgiveness of the note to Daddy.  I am willing
to allow her to continue as executrix until the anniversary of Daddy's
death.  Twelve months is ample time to settle an estate as simple as his.  I
will allow her to keep my grandfather's single shot shotgun that Daddy left
to me, but that she and her husband stole from my father's bedroom while he
was in the hosptal dying.  I would even be willing to not make her repay the
value of Daddy's truck or return the extra $1,000 that she sold his car for,
but that she did not put in the estate.
I mailed the $1,000 check today.  Sorry for the delay.  I've just been very
busy.  If we are going to file to remove Glenda as executrix, I'll need a
new one with the correct date of Daddy's death to execute.
I'll be in Auburn from tomorrow night until Sunday.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


This will report on last Thursday's meeting of the joint defense group.  All the defendants were represented by either in-house or outside counsel.  Parenthetically, plaintiffs have still not served Enron Gas Marketing, Inc.  The only Enron defendants who have been served are Intratex and Enron Corp.  Parenthetically, again, all served defendants have been given an extension of time until December 5 to move, answer or otherwise plead.

The items discussed were as follows:

1.  Comment on the wording and time frame for filing three draft form pleadings prepared by F&J:

a.  a motion to the plaintiff's counsel to show authority;

b.  a plea to the jurisdiction; and

c. an answer and affirmative answer.

2.  Whether the holding companies should file motions to transfer venue.

3.  Whether there should be a joint defense fund, with a formal joint defense agreement.

At the end of the discussion, it was concluded as follows:

1.  The F&J draft pleadings looked good, and all agreed to recommend to their respective client group that (a) each group of defendants would file their own plea, answer and affirmative defenses on December 5, the deadline for doing so (I will circulate a draft tailored for the Enron defendants well before then) but that (b) all the served defendants would join in the motion to show authority. Although, strictly speaking, this is not a classic case for a motion to show authority, no one saw a downside to it, and thought the presence of such a motion would be additional help in putting off any discovery requests.  The big concern in this case is keeping Grynberg from getting discovery here that could help him in his other cases.

2.  I was tasked with the job of legal research on whether the non-measurer, non-taxpayer holding companies had a good shot at a motion to transfer venue, and whether there was any downside to so moving.  Of course, under the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure, such a motion must be filed before any other plea or pleading but for a special appearance, or it is waived.

3.  No one appeared interested in a joint defense fund or a formal joint defense agreement, and it was agreed that the parties would pass around projects for the common good (like item #2) on a "rough justice" basis.

I will continue to keep you advised.

Britt

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I talked to Bill Newman (Southern) about this proposal yesterday.  I asked Bill if we were correct in reading the proposal to say that Southern was now open to consider the use of financial rights for transmission rather than physical rights.  He said that was correct.  I asked him if they were also willing to consider an auction as a mechanism to allocate financial rights.  He said they would consider an auction as long as they could have a way to obtain the rights needed to serve native load without driving up the cost of that service.

This is a major change in Southern's position and may open the door for resolving the major differences between the SETrans group and the Grids on congestion management functions, assuming the Grids stay with the approach that came out of the FERC mediation sessions.

I also asked Bill if he was negotiating with Entergy to form an RTO.  He said he could not confirm that officially (but confidentially- they were talking a lot more and we should see something in a couple of weeks.  He also indicated that this was the reason they were now open to the financial rights approach).

Based on the above, I think the Southern transmission pricing proposal was their attempt to gain support of the PSCs, by addressing the PSCs concerns about transmission cost increases, and to open the door to resolving the differences Southern has had with Entergy over financial vs physical transmission rights.

As far as the proposal is concerned, and the study by the Analysis Group/Economics,  there are a lot of issues we could raise with both.  The study is only valid for the specific assumptions they made (rolled in rates for all transmission and long-term sales from Henry Hub to PJM) and Southern's proposal, once again, leaves too much unspecified to know exactly what they intended.

I think we would be best served by taking the position that we welcome the study report pointing out the some of the very issues that need to be addressed in the next phase being proposed by FERC for the development of a Southeast RTO, and we are glad to note that the Analysis Group recognized that many of the issues raised could be resolved by  previous proposals to reform transmission pricing, such as the proposal to auction financial rights that Enron has been advocating.  We are also pleased to note that Southern has also recognized the use of financial rights as a viable alternative to physical transmission rights.

Please let me know if you do not agree with the above approach, and I'll give you a list of issues we could raise with the Southern proposal. But, I think we should wait a couple of weeks and see if Southern and Entergy have something put together we can address.

One update is that with regard to the Larry Lindsey meeting we have asked Ed Gillespie to talk to him about tomorrow's meeting.

We wanted you to know this piece and that a Ken call to Lindsey is not necessary, although it undoubtedly cannot hurt.

Lisa,
Here is the deal as it stands with each counterparty:

Texas Brine
Wayne Sneed--Treasurer, the main contact, his number is 713-877-2661
Ted Grabowski--President and CEO, 713-877-2716
Sale Agreement--The "Cash Sale Form" is drafted, no changes needed, Gerald can get executable copies ready right away
Easements Agreement--We would like to delay execution if possible, but Gerald can have executables in place fairly quickly if they insist
DASH--written, requires signatures, beginning with Dave Gorte.

I will call Wayne in the morning and tell him to remain on standy. We'll know fairly quickly where we are when Reliant calls us tomorrow morning around 10:30, and I can tell him before my flight leaves.   If the Reliant deal is off, we can start moving right away on this.  I'll tell him to be in touch with you regarding document delivery and cash transfer.

Reliant
Ken Bradley--VP Energy Wholesale Group, main contact, his office number is 713-207-1456.  He tends to be easier to reach on his cell, 713-805-3889.
Sale Agreement--The "Act of Sale" is drafted and just needs to have the new pricing put in, at which point we can get executables and signature.
Board Resolution--Drafted and submitted to Reliant, we expect they will not have issues with it and we can get executables on what we have.
Corporate Guaranty--Has been executed for $3MM.  Gerald has the original.  For ease of execution we will try to get Reliant to accept it at $3MM even with a higher sale price, but if pressed we will have to get another one signed for the amount of the sale.  I believe Clement Abrams will take care of that, but check with Gerald.
Certificate of Non-Foreign Status--Signed by Stephen Douglas, I have left you the original (for Reliant, I assume) and 2 copies (for us)
DASH--written, but will require ran update for new pricing.  Need to show Gorte one last time, get his signature, and then it needs the rest of the signatures.

Ken will be calling us back around 10:30 tomorrow immediately after his meeting with whomever can authorize a higher price, he has all our numbers so if he can't reach me he will call Jean directly in Buffalo.  If we get a suitable price ($3.25 MM or higher), then the next step is to get them comfortable with the guaranty we have executed, then get the DASH signed and move on from there.  In my previous email, I told him you would be involved, so I'll put him in touch with you as soon as we have a deal.

The wiring instructions for either party are as follows:

Account name: 		ECT Cash Services Acc. Entity
Bank Name:     		Citibank New York
Account Number : 	40781075
Routing Number :	021000089

Reliant already has these instructions.  Either party may want to cut a check instead, it just becomes a question of which is faster and easier.

I will forward you the latest copies of all the documents for each party as separate emails.  As far as signatures are concerned, Julie Gomez told me she would be in on Wednesday and availabe to sign, but Jean may want to handle it via fax.  That can be decided tomorrow.  I will list out the rest of the needed signatures in the respective emails.

Well, try as I may, I'm sure there are issues I have not covered, so feel free to call me at any point at the phone numbers I sent earlier.  Good luck and THANKS for helping us out!

Eva

Jim talked to me about his resignation again on Friday. He indicated that he
wished for his replacement to be chosen before he resigns. I think he really
thought he is helping the board by doing it this way. I told him that I did
not believe that it was appropriate to "arrange" things. I also told him that
he can remain on the board for as long as he lives in his unit. And the board
will replace him by seeking the best person to fill his seat for the
remainder of his term when he resigns. He indicated that in the past the next
person getting the highest number of votes would be selected. I informed him
that while this had happened in the past, but the board is not obligated to
do it in this manner.

We should ask anyone who is interested to fill this seat to submit his/her
name to be considered by the board.

This DASH definitely needs a Legal Risk memo, which I have attached as a separate document.  Along with the DASH, it needs to be updated for the actual sale price (and the date was wrong--I fixed that on the attached but be sure Gerald's version has the right date) and then added on to the body of the DASH before signatures.  Gorte has already looked at this one, so we should be okay to get going on the signatures right away, though I would still start with him, just in case.

There must be a computer glitch (!!!), because I am not able to open the Act of Sale and Board Resolution documents that Gerald forwarded.  He will, of course, provide executable copies of those documents anyway (same goes for the TB documents), but I will forward you his email and hopefully you will have better luck opening them than I did. The DASH anf the Lega Risk Memo are attached below, and I will leave copies of the Certificate of Non-Foreign Status on your desk.

I am printing the budget stuff now.  It all seems to be here.  I probably will have no comments on EES before I get back.  I assume on EIM and EGM, you are getting the respective OTCs to approve in detail in front of everyone their invoices for 2002 as Louise did.

I wont be able to look at the Whalley stuff real close until tomorrow morning so you and Kerry and Mark agree it is OK relative to what we gave him October 15th and I will call in tomorrow morning to give my views.

Any  feedback yet on the all employee meeting?  I also listened to your voice mail last night.

A couple of suggestions on which I would appreciate your response:
1.  I believe we need to have internal due diligence/factual investigation done on whether any of the Enron entities served--Enron Corp.(of which Northern was a division for a period of time), Enron Gas Marketing, Inc. (EGM) or Intratex ever gathered gas, was the first measurer of gas, or provided measurement of gas on which ad valorem taxes were calculated, for Zapata County or communitized wells in adjacent counties that included leases located in whole or in part in Zapata County.  The petition specifically mentions that it includes acts going back to 1974 and earlier, so I would like to see how far back we can fairly easily put together a chronology.  What I hope to have is a time line of who did what and during what period of time, and locate the most important documents to show this.
I am assuming that EGM was at all times only a marketer, although we need to do the due diligence to make sure.  Enron Corp. will be pretty easy, although Northern was for a brief period of time in the early 90s a division of Enron Corp., and Northern had non-contiguous gathering in South Texas that stopped right at the Zapata County line.  If that gathering system took gas from, say, a well in an adjacent county that was communitized with a lease in Zapata County, Enron Corp. may stay in the picture.  Last, with respect to Intratex, I am told by Lou that we no longer have the Intratex documents; did they go with HPL as a result of the sale?
Becky and I are stretched thin on various matters right now and would like to suggest that we retain Marianne Salinas on this project immediately.
2. I think it would be helpful to snag a first-rate gas measurement consultant now, before they all get taken.  I know Ken Cessac, who works here, very well, and think a great deal of him.  I know Andy has used him extensively already in Grynberg-related matters.  You may want to save money and not retain our own consultant, and instead rely on Ken; however, I know that Ken is being kept very busy.  On the other hand, I also think it is likely that we will wind up sharing at least the testifying gas measurement experts and their costs.  So, this is a judgment call.  However, I would be inclined to go ahead and retain Paul LaNasa, who sits on several AGA committees, as an Enron-only consulting expert, even though I don't think he is up to speed on the Grynberg allegations.  Both Grant Harvy and I were very impressed by him during the Northern v. ONEOK arbitration, during which we worked with him extensively and presented him as an expert witness (although I don't proposed to use him as a testifying expert here).  My point would be that if there was anything wrong with Enron's measurement that was either worse than or better than our co-defendants' measurement,  or put us in a different position, I am very confident he could point it out to us.
I appreciate your thoughts.

Per our conversations with Tony Walden at VNG, Tony has been instructed not to release any funds to Enron per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL.  AGL is the parent of VNG.  I will be out of the office on Wednesday, but if you need any more information from Settlements, please contact Margaret Dhont, at 713-853-7683.
Here's the blow by blow:
Tuesday a.m.
Tony Walden (VNG) told Kay Khan (settlements coordinator for ENA) that he had the payment set up in their system to pay ENA $7,264,089.42, but that per Beth White, VP & Controller of AGL no payments were to be released to Enron.
Around 11:30 - Bryce Baxter contacted Beth White to find out what the issues were that would prevent payment.  Left message.
Tuesday p.m.
Around 3:00 - Bryce Baxter called Beth White again and spoke with her secretary.  Her secretary said she would send Beth a text page and would call back as soon as possible, but haven't received return call yet.
Around 4:30 - Bryce Baxter called Beth again and left another message.  Kay Khan also called Tony Walden again and left another message, letting him know we hadn't received a call back from Beth White.
David Jones has also called a couple of his Commercial counterparts at VNG/AGL today, but was not able to get a response.  I tried to talk to David tonight so I could give you specific names, but was unable to reach him.

Monday, November 26, as Head of Research. In this newly-created position,
David will be responsible for providing research and analytical support for
our various committees and initiatives. In particular, he will work on
aspects of our risk management activities, providing technical assistance on
issues surrounding the Basel capital accord. He will oversee our market
survey and will work with those committees (operations, collateral) and

Budget update/suggestions:

Piper, Richter, and Webb met with Whalley this Saturday for a few hours on overall EnronOnline strategy and budget.  We showed him the development completed to date and the general development list going forward.  We also showed him the down time report as well as some growth numbers over the last 12 months.  We also explained a few of the commercial objectives going forward.  Finally, we showed him the same suggested EOL budget plan we showed you, including 2001 plan vs. 2001 forecast vs. 2002 plan as well as the allocation methodology.  Greg is generally OK with the total 2002 plan number for EOL ($37.7 million fully loaded with bonus, indirects and depreciation), why we want that money and where it would be spent.  What he did not like was the allocation methodology, which is currently cost based and based on development and products.  He suggested a charge that included a fixed fee plus a product setup fee plus a product maintenance fee plus a per transaction charge, etc.  Richter and Webb are researching that and will try to see if it will work.  I think you and I can agree the $37.7 million is good for 2002 but we still need to agree on your part for EA.  The current cost based suggestion for EA for EOL for 2002 is about $22 million.  A question is, will you and Lavo accept any charges for 2002 for EOL based on transactions?  Sheriff also has the entire EOL suggested budget and his part.  We meet EIM and EGM today on their total ENW charges.

On Operations, the current suggested 2002 EA charge is $44.7 million, which is also a fully loaded number and is slightly down from 2001 forecast (Sally and Bob and I can explain that in detail this week).  What I would like to do is agree between you and I that you will accept that as EAs budget number for 2002 plan for Operations.  What we still need to work on is how we would possibly bill that in some fixed and variable form that includes transaction counts.

On infrastructure, the current suggested EA plan number for 2002 $40.9 million.  This is down from 2001 forecast.  This does not include the $10.5 million of controllable expense you budget directly for EA.  The issue left here is what is EAs headcount, what is the headcount in IT development and what is the server infrastructure charge related to IT development that would effect the EA number.  On the first issue, we have the EA headcount as represented by HR.  The current EA infrastructure charge assumes that complete number.  It is larger than the number you have.  You have requested we deal with some of that additional headcount differently since EA can't bill out those on a fully loaded basis.  We will work with Wes and his team on that today and tomorrow to come up with a plan.

On IT Development, the current suggested 2002 plan expense number for EA, fully loaded, is $$44.5 million vs. a 2001 forecast of $34.4 million.  Also, the 2002 suggested capital number for EA is $50.1 million vs. a 2001 forecast capital number of $50 million.  The question is, what did you get for your $84.4 million in 2001 and what would you get for $94.6 million in 2002?  First, Mark and Sally and I met on Sunday and we want the 2002 plan numbers to be down from 2001 forecast.  What we need to do in the next three days is finalize what are the critical maintenance and new development projects for 2002 for EA.  Our team is Bob Hall, Mark Pickering (Mark will call on Stock and Perlman and Rao and Hotte as he sees necessary) and Greg Piper with Pickering having the final say for ENW. Can you tell me who you want from your side (Story? Belden?) to work with us three over the next few days until we agree?  We want to work on it around the clock until it is at least approximately right.

Your thoughts?

Much truth in this rapier thrust of humor.  As I continue to reflect on events, rumors and speculations, it strikes me that the Enron story seems to be unfolding as a story that is all about a kind of Rogue upper management thing.  The traditional fear of rogue trading, where a trader has control of the back office and spins off into a series of trades, each one designed to offset a previous bad one until the whole house of cards tumbles down,  this prototypical risk was carefully managed at Enron.  We actually have a very high quality trading business with good legal, accounting and settlement processes in place.  What we didn't have covered was a king of rogue financial sorcery thing by the very top executives.  Rogue balance sheet shenanigans  seems to be the problem.  It is a kind of corruption that is difficult to isolate and purge ourselves of.  Instead of isolating a single bad guy and firing him and then telling everybody all is well, this   kind of corruption seems to call for a  revolution from below, or, as seems increasingly likely, a takeover from without.   ----cgy

The following was received from a friend:
Most of us remember the Oliver North hearings, but do not recall the name
of Osama bin Laden as the terrorist that North was threatened by. It's
pretty evident in hindsight that we should have listened to Ollie!
In a recent university lecture the other day they played a video of
Oliver North during the Iran-Contra deals during the Reagan
administration.
There was Ollie in front of God and Country getting the third degree. But
what he said was stunning. He was being grilled by some senator who asked
him; 'Did you not recently spend close to $60,000 for a home security
system?'
Oliver replied, 'Yes I did sir.'
The senator continued, trying to get a laugh out of the audience, 'Isn't
this just a little excessive?'
'No sir,' continued Oliver.
'No. And why not?'
'Because the life of my family and I were threatened.'
'Threatened? By who.'
'By a terrorist, sir.'
'Terrorist? What terrorist could possibly scare you that much?'
'His name is Osama bin Laden.'
At this point the senator tried to repeat the name, but couldn't
pronounce it, which most people back then probably couldn't. A couple of
people laughed at the attempt and then the senator continued.
'Why are you so afraid of this man?'
'Because sir, he is the most evil person alive that I know of.'
'And what do you recommend we do about him?'
'If it were me I would recommend an assassin team be formed to eliminate
him and his men from the face of the earth.' The senator disagreed with
this approach and that was the end of the video clip.
It's scary when you think 15 years ago the government was aware of Osama
bin Laden and his potential threat to the security of the world. I guess
like all great tyrants they start small but if left untended spread like
the virus they truly are."

Curriculum Review Task Force (CRTF)
Report # 10 (November 5, 2001)


October was a very busy and productive month for the Curriculum Review Task
Force. We had intensive three-hour meetings on October 3 and 9 which were
followed by routine meetings on October 22 and 29. On the 18th, three CRTF
members (George Arnold, Craig Watson, and Raj Ambrose) participated in a
meeting of the Academic Affairs Committee of the Trustees which was devoted
entirely to the Curriculum Review.

As explained in my last report, the CRTF obtained unanimous agreement on the
five Educational Goals: A. Critical Thinking, B. Communication, C. Values,
Inquiry, and Exploration, D. Variety of Human Experience, and E. Depth of
Knowledge and Integration of Learning with an addendum on Wellness/Health
Co-curriculum. The Task Force then used an intensive work session to brain
storm on the operational ends of these goals. Further discussion and some
pruning led to 4 or 5 operational ends for each goal. Two members of the
Task Force wrote the descriptive statements for each goal and its
operational ends. These were then reviewed by the full Task Force and with
another member contributing the preamble, the draft statement on Educational
Goals (copy attached) was ready for presentation to the faculty. At the
request of the CRTF, the Faculty Senate reviewed these educational goals and
decided to send them for a ACommittee of the Whole@ discussion at the
ensuing faculty meeting. We would like to point out that the CRTF looked at
several models from other schools in preparing the Educational Goals. Some
of these schools are very similar to Monmouth College.

The ten trustees who were present at the Academic Affairs Committee meeting
had a preview of the draft educational goals. The trustees received them
very well and made some valuable suggestions.

The CRTF has spent considerable time discussing how these goals can be
achieved through a well-planned, four-year, integrated curriculum. The
work-load, calendar, departmental structure, general education models, and
available resources are some of the major issues that are being considered
in relation to the achievement of these educational goals.

Dr. Tom Sienkewicz brought to our attention that Dr. Gregory Dougherty, who
gave the recent Bernice L. Fox Classics Lecture, is a member of the
Curriculum Review Task Force at Randolph Macon College which is also in the
midst of a major Curricular Review. As part of this process, they had
studied the Educational Programs of about half a dozen colleges which are
similar to Randolph Macon and our college happened to be one of them. We
invited Dr. Dougherty to the meeting of our Task Force on October 29 and had
a very fruitful discussion with him. Of particular interest to us is
Randolph Macon=s new first year program which uses a three-course sequence
of ALearning Communities@ developed and taught by all their faculty taking
turns. We decided to keep in touch.

Raj Ambrose, Chair.


Draft Educational Goals

The AEducational Goals@ listed and briefly described below represent
consensus of the Curriculum Review Task Force about intended outcomes and
experiences of the academic program that should guide review and revision of
the Monmouth College curriculum, especially with reference to Areinvesting
in pedagogy@ and re-imagining design to enhance student learning.

We are confident that this list summarizes educational goals central to the
liberal arts philosophy of higher education.  We also understand that these
educational goals affirm and clarify  elements of the Mission Statement of
the college and those Apurposes@ derived from the Mission that directly
address the academic program.

Having spent considerable time articulating these goals, we are keenly aware
that agreement about the language we use to describe them is both important
for subsequent stages in the review process and achievable only through
discussion and mutual compromise.

Our aim then in the ACommittee of the Whole@ discussion upcoming at the
November 4th Faculty meeting is to present this statement for your review,
explain what we mean by the language we have used, listen to your responses,
and, if necessary, make changes.

What will we do if and when we win your agreement to this or a revised
version of AEducational Goals@?

1. We will decide questions we have already begun to
discuss: AGiven these goals, how best may we enable students to achieve them
in four years of undergraduate education?  Specifically, does our present
array and structure of disciplines optimally promote achievement?  Our
calendar?  Our workload?  Our general education program?   Our pedagogical
approaches in classroom settings?  Our extra-curricular, curricular
programming (residence education, internships, off-campus opportunities,
etc.) ?

2. In light of this critique (which in the coming months
will itself sponsor more frequent  discussions of possible proposals for
change in calendar, workload, General Education, etc.), we will attempt to
map and model then four years of undergraduate education ideally designed to
achieve our educational goals.   In this phase of the process especially, we
will involve faculty as researchers, resources, and planners to a)
understand our student clientele and their typical cognitive development; b)
revise our current curriculum; and c) enhance pedagogy and clarify
assessment strategies pertinent to our educational goals.

With approval of AEducational Goals@ we imagine spending the next five to
seven months on stages 1 and 2, with the understanding that it may be
possible to pass new initiatives and proposals for revision incrementally
along the way.    Furthermore, given the scope of our Areview,@ it may well
be necessary to imagine a multi-year schedule of planning and phased
implementation that extends well beyond the term of the current task force=s
assignment.

It should be noted that competencies like critical thinking and rhetoric,
though presented conceptually as separate entities under different goals,
will actually be interwoven throughout the curriculum and work interactively
with other competencies and goals.

A. Critical Thinking
Critical thinking is an acquired intellectual process through which
students are able to analyze carefully and critically all ideas and
information by distinguishing fact from fallacy, questioning assumptions,
synthesizing knowledge, and arriving at logical conclusions. This competency
is demonstrated by the ability of students to:
1.	understand the logic, validity and relevance of their own arguments
and the information and ideas they observe and work with;
2.	pose and solve complex problems and make informed decisions;
3.	understand and apply the scientific method where the concerned
discipline requires such an approach; and,
4.	work with numerical data and apply quantitative reasoning in
processing such data.

B. Communication
Communication is a foundational competency which the students absolutely
need and continue to learn across the curriculum with a conscious effort to
improve their reading, writing, speaking, listening and information literacy
skills. This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students to:
1.	use effectively and grammatically a broad English vocabulary in
speaking and writing through accomplished rhetorical strategies;
2.	access, evaluate, select, interpret, and incorporate information and
media sources in their studies and to be productive in the modern
technological world;
3.	have a basic understanding of another language (besides English) and
its cultural background; and,
4.	interact with others with empathy and understanding and collaborate
effectively in group settings.

C. Values, Inquiry, and Exploration
It is the ability of students to explore the nature and scope of the human
condition through specific modes of inquiry and to develop a system of
values that would help them make real choices and assume responsibility for
their actions. This competency is demonstrated by the ability of students

Phillip,

I want to thank you for spending so much time with us today; I think we are
getting to a good level of detail and we accomplished a lot today. I left a
message for Ed and asked him to just focus on one or two difficult problems
because we are planning to also include some of your "easy" problems in the
simulation.

We will look forward to getting the outlines for the remaining four
scenarios from you early next week. Please let us know if something comes
up and you don't think you'll be able to work on them.

We'll call Ina with the room for next Friday. Thanks again for all your
help, and have a great weekend.
Mery

Tana,

These deals are purely for storage.  They used tagg to capture the value of storing the physical gas.  Pat Ryder in Risk Management put these deals in and has told me they are used for value and should be "Not to be Confirmed."  If you see no issue, I will simply change their status to "Not to be Confirmed."  If their status of being under EGM is still a problem, Pat said you could call him at 5-3313.


Thanks,

I have not heard back from Lazaro as to our request for an extension of time.  I left a call for him today, asking him to call me back tomorrow morning.

I have received a copy of the Court's file from Lazaro by letter dated October 26.  It is thin, but indicates that this suit clearly fit within the framework of a larger strategy by Grynberg involving Quinque.  Keep in mind that what we have been served is a first supplemental petition:

1.  There is an original petition that was filed July 15, 1999, which purports to be a class action suit on behalf of Zapata County and all other similarly situated counties and parishes in the United States of America for deliquent ad valorem taxes and other damages.  Although I have not compared the original petition in Zapata County with the petition in Quinque, both the list of defendants and allegations of mismeasurement appear to be the same.  The plaintiff's attorneys seem to be the same.  Although I have not compared the original Zapata petition with the first supplemental Zapata petition, I see no mention of RSM Production or the Zapata County Independent School District in the original petition, although both appear in the first supplemental petition.  There is no class action allegation in the supplemental petition (although it does mention gas produced in Zapata county and, cryptically, in other counties).  I have never seen a "supplemental" pleading that dropped class action allegations and defendants, and added plaintiffs.  The first supplemental petition is more correctly titled an amended petition.  Perhaps the plaintiff's attorney had a reason for not calling attention to the radical change in the nature of a lawsuit.

2.  On March 21, 2000, the Court issued an order on plaintiff's verified motion to retain case.  The order was based on a motion by plaintiff for itself and all other similarly situated counties, alleging that the same group of defendants had been sued in Quinque and removed the case.  "Judicial economy will result in the present action by waiting for a ruling in the Kansas litigation, thus avoiding the same procedural motions in this case."  Plaintiff moved for and was granted abatement of the case for 6 months until September 21, 2000 or until 30 days after a ruling on the motion for remand in the Kansas litigation, whichever comes first.

3.  On March 12, 2001 (almost a year later than item #2), one of plaintiff's counsel, the law firm of Farnsworth and Von Berg, L.L.P., here in Houston, moved to withdraw as counsel for non-payment of fees by Jack Grynberg.  The motion notes as follows:  "In November 1999, following filing of this lawsuit, Movants and Jack Grynberg and RSM Corporation, as representative of Zapata County Independent School District, severed their attorney/client relationship because Jack Grynberg failed to pay attorney fees as per their contractual agreement."  There is nothing in the file reflecting even a proposed order, much less a hearing on the motion.

4.  The Court's docket sheet indicates that on August 30, 2001, the case was called again by the Court and "reset for 9-27-01" (I am assuming that this is for another DWOP docket).

5.  On September 25, plaintiffs filed their first supplemental petition by fax.

6.  On September 27, the case was called before Judge Robert R. Eschenburg, and Jose A. Lopez (one of the plaintiff's attorneys) attended, and a scheduling order was to be filed.

7.  On October 1, about 20 citations were issued on various defendants.

8.  On October 19, a letter to Jose Lopez from Margaret Timmons was filed.  The file sent to me does not contain a copy.

9.  On October 22, the Court's docket literally shows that citation was served on Enron Gas Marketing, Inc., "Not executed."  I think that means that the return of service on Enron Gas Marketing Inc. was filed.

I will make copies and have them distributed.

Britt

US Utilities Are Slow To Make Life Harder For Enron

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -(Dow Jones)- U.S. utilities are in no hurry to impose strict credit restrictions on future deals with troubled energy trading giant Enron Corp. (ENE), according to utility executives gathered for a national power conference here this week.

Even as they nervously tracked Enron's stock plunge during coffee breaks Tuesday on their Internet-enabled wireless devices, and lunchtime chat Wednesday turned to the prospects for additional downgrades of the company's debt, executives mostly said they're merely evaluating their relationships with Enron at his point, while hoping for the best.

After losing more than two-thirds of their value over the past two weeks and falling to their lowest level in a decade, Enron shares rose Wednesday for the first time since Oct. 16, gaining $2.74 to $13.90.

"We're very interested in their recovery," said David Rozier, senior vice president at Mirant Corp.'s (MIR) Mirant Americas Inc., noting that the demise of such a large player could have a ripple effect on markets. "We're looking at that situation very carefully."

Aquila Inc. (ILA), which does a significant amount of trading with Enron, likewise "would be reluctant to make changes" to that relationship, said Steve Magness, executive vice president in charge of strategic partnerships. "We would not change due to perception, only for financial reasons."

"We are constantly monitoring and evaluating the creditworthiness of counterparties (in trading)," added Aquila Senior Vice President and General Manager Brad Nordholm. Should Enron lose its investment-grade rating status, that would affect Aquila's continued willingness to trade with Enron, he said.

Moody's Investors Service Inc. on Monday downgraded its rating on Enron's senior unsecured debt to Baa2 from Baa1, placing its rating two levels above noninvestment grade, and kept the company under review for a possible further downgrade. Moody's said the downgrade was based on deterioration in the company's financial flexibility following an announced large quarterly loss and reduction of shareholder equity.

Additional unease has been created by reports about a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into certain financial transactions involving Enron.

European trading partners reportedly are taking a harder line with Enron than U.S. companies, which some here said could be due to foreign companies having less interest in the strength of markets here.

"Still, we want to trade in stable markets. We don't want to see any major long-term problems," said Trevor Pethick, director of trading with Powergen PLC's (PWG) Energy Trading unit. His company, like its U.S. counterparts, is "reviewing our situation with Enron," he said.

Coral Energy, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell, continues to trade with Enron, although debt downgrades do lead Coral Energy to make changes to their business relationships with any trading partner, said Jeff Beicker, senior vice president of trading.

"I'm not seeing people saying, 'Let's save Enron' or 'Let's pounce on Enron.' It's business as usual," said Beicker. "The market capitalization is where they're getting hammered."

He and Aquila's Magness, answering questions from conference goers following a presentation on risk management, downplayed the possible impact of such a large trading company as Enron going out of business. Both said they would expect more alternative trading platforms to EnronOnline to emerge quickly and fill any trading voids.

Beicker further predicted that should Enron go under, trading margins would grow and companies would have to pay more going forward "for warehousing their risk."

The Worldwide Business Research Power 2001 conference continues Thursday at the Camelback Inn resort in Scottsdale, Ariz.





Generators say state manipulating power market - They accuse the IPO of sharing inside information with the water agency.

SACRAMENTO -- The state Department of Water Resources is demanding and getting privileged information from the state's electricity grid operator that, power generators say, is being used to illegally manipulate the energy market.

The role reversal - in which power generators are now accusing the state of violating federal laws to manipulate the market - was at the center of two depositions taken Wednesday by a Senate committee investigating the California energy crisis.

The Department of Water Resources in January started buying energy for the state because the private utilities weren't able to pay their bills and lawmakers feared rolling blackouts would ensue.

On Wednesday, officers with the Independent System Operator - which schedules electricity onto the state's power grid - told the special Senate committee that the Department of Water Resources buyers have been threatening since spring to stop buying unless they are provided with exclusive information about the grid.

"We have heard indications that if we failed to provide information, we may not have the backing,'' an ISO vice president, Jim Detmers, said.

He said the information includes the amount of electricity the ISO is short in what is called the hour-ahead market. The sharing of this same type of information among private generators last year led to accusations of gouging from state officials.

Water Resources spokesman Oscar Hildago said the information is only used to ensure the buys are a justifiable use of taxpayer money.

"We have to stand behind those purchases, and the law, AB1X, did not give us the authority to write a blank check to (the ISO),'' he said, referring to the bill that put the state in the power business.

State Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, who chairs the special committee, said the state is now being accused of using privileged information to schedule controversial, high-priced long-term energy contracts the state secured in the early days of the crisis.

"The allegations from the generator community have been that DWR has wrested control of the wholesale market from ISO and they did so for purposes of dumping the long-term contracts into the market when there is lower-priced electricity available,'' said Dunn.

In an Oct. 18 filing with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, power generators say that this is a violation of the regulations with which the operators must comply.

"Acting on behalf of the State ... the highly politicized (ISO) is engaged in an organized, deliberate effort to subvert the market mechanisms established by the commission,'' the filing reads.

Hildago countered: "Quite frankly ... the louder they scream that something is unfair (that) is a measure of the success we have."





ISO officials go public with testimony

Two members of the state's electric grid operator chose to give depositions to a Senate committee in public Wednesday despite a Senate resolution calling for them to be kept secret.

The committee wanted the secrecy to prevent unfounded rumors from becoming public, according to its chairman, Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana.

But Dunn said recently that those subpoenaed to testify could choose to do so in public.

On Wednesday, two officials from the California Independent System Operator took him up on the offer - Elena Schmid, vice president of communications and strategic development, and Jim Detmers, vice president of operations.

"We're an organization that's all about openness," said ISO spokeswoman Stephanie McCorkle. "It's part of our culture to want to open things up."

The testimony, she said, "served the purpose of going back in time and looking at the many factors that contributed to the crisis."

Other energy officials will also ask the committee for public depositions, she said, including the president and chief executive officer, Terry Winter, who is scheduled to appear Tuesday.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy Market issued 16 subpoenas to current and former board members and staff of the grid operator.

But Winter's testimony will be of particular interest. The actions he took Dec. 8 to lift a price cap on wholesale energy cost is at the heart of the committee's investigation.

Dunn says Winter failed to tell the ISO board or other state officials about his request to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to lift the $250-per-megawatt hour cap. It was replaced with a soft cap requiring generators to justify their costs above $250.

A Senate resolution approved in July spelled out the ground rules for the depositions, saying no one could be present except members and staff of Dunn's committee, the person taking the deposition, an official report, the person being deposed and accompanying counsel.

But some have questioned the secrecy, saying it could make the testimony prone to manipulation.

In response to questions from the committee's special counsel, Laurence Drivon, Detmers testified Wednesday about the unraveling of the electricity market in the days leading up to Dec. 8, with dispatchers scrambling every hour to find enough power to keep the lights on.



$1 million to fight S.F. public power / PG&E Corp. against city ballot measures

The corporate parent of PG&E, the bankrupt California utility fighting for financial recovery, has pumped more than $1 million into a campaign to defeat a pair of public power measures on Tuesday's ballot in San Francisco.

Company representatives say they want to protect their assets in the city, where there are 365,000 Pacific Gas and Electric Co. customers. Independent experts say more is at stake.

"I'm sure they don't want to see a snowball effect where other cities try to turn them out," said Severin Borenstein, director of the University of California 's Energy Institute.

Borenstein noted that Los Angeles, the state's largest city, had long been in the public power business. So has Sacramento and a number of smaller cities, such as Alameda and Palo Alto. PG&E serves 4.7 million customers in the state.

"If you're looking at a major movement, San Francisco is the biggest location where this is being discussed now," Borenstein said yesterday.

San Diego and San Jose also have been looking at putting their electrical system under public control, but have yet to take action. In San Francisco, two measures on the ballot would pave the way for a publicly owned electricity system.

Measure I would set up an independent municipal utility district for San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane, governed by state law. Proposition F would create a Water and Power Agency in San Francisco only and retain ties to City Hall.

In both cases, elected directors would decide whether to seize PG&E's transmission and distribution lines.

PG&E has said it isn't interested in selling, and for decades has fought at City Hall and in court to derail such efforts in San Francisco. But last winter's energy crisis shifted public attitudes and a more liberal Board of Supervisors pushed the public power proposals forward.

Still, PG&E vigorously opposes the effort. Campaign finance reports show PG&E spent $1,023,289 through Oct. 20 to defeat the measures. How much more money the company has poured into the campaign since then will not be made public until after the election.

Other business interests gave nearly $400,000 more through Oct. 20 to fight the ballot measures. The contributors include Pacific Telesis Group ($100,000) and AT&T ($150,000). The companies fear the creation of a MUD would lead the new agency's directors to try to take over the phone and communications operations, too. The Committee on Jobs, a big business group funded in part by PG&E, gave $110,500.

The money has paid for campaign consultants, mailers, slate cards, polls, phone banks and TV ads.

PG&E spokeswoman Jennifer Ramp said the spending was warranted.

"It's perfectly natural that any company -- bankrupt or not -- facing a hostile takeover would fight the measures and get the word out to people that this is not going to solve the energy crisis," Ramp said.

She added the money used in the campaign did not come from the utility but from its corporate parent company.

Ross Mirkarimi, who runs the public power campaigns, was more blunt in his assessment of PG&E's campaign contributions.

"They are going to do everything they can to preserve their monopoly and greed," he said.

The campaigns in favor of Proposition F and Measure I raised a little more than $90,000 through Oct. 20. Bay Guardian newspaper publisher Bruce Brugmann and his wife, Jean, gave $10,500. The weekly paper, which has long crusaded for public power, provided an additional $38,000 in free advertising. The Vanguard Public Foundation donated another $10,000.

SENDER :::: 12043

COUNT :::: 1048

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Kay, Steve, Ben and Ryan,
I spoke with Martha today on the subject referred to above and she
advised me of the following :
1.   DEP is not contemplating a single, consolidated permit but an air
permit  for each of the Pompano Beach and Deerfield Beach facilities.
2.   The petitioning local governments have no objection to the
consolidation proposed by DEP (no surprises there).
3.   Martha wants our input as to which ALJ we would prefer to hear
the case should DEP's request for consolidation be granted.   (  The upside
to suggesting Judge Alexander is that we know that he have already reserved
his time for a 4-day hearing in January.  Otherwise, we might choose Judge
Stampelos based upon the prior comments that we have received from our
Tallahassee attorneys, although both Judges were considered to be good.).
4. Martha indicated previously that she is looking for a hearing
in January, depending upon which ALJ hears the case and his particular
schedule.
5.  Martha advised me that she will file her request for
consolidation late tomorrow afternoon.  I told her, as we discussed in our
conference call, that if she does not hear from me to the contrary, then we
oppose the consolidation at this time.
6.  Martha agreed to provide us with the permit language that DEP
is proposing in connection with its Notice of Change of Agency Position  on
the Pompano Beach proceeding as soon as Al Linero completes the drafting and
she reviews the proposed permit conditions with him.  Martha expects to
provide us with the proposed permit language next  Monday or Tuesday.
7.  The petitioning local governments have served DEP with
discovery.  I have yet to receive a copy of the discovery but Martha intends
to meet with Al Linero this Friday to discuss  DEP's response.
Based upon the foregoing, please advise me if you want me to
convey any further message to Martha prior to her filing of the motion for
consolidation tomorrow afternoon.  Specifically, I am interested in your
thoughts on our preference on the Judge that will hear the proceeding, if
consolidated, and whether we have any objection to DEP's filing the motion
for consolidation in which she will note our objection.  As we discussed in
our conference call, we can assert our position more fully in a subsequent
response to the motion for consolidation and can withdraw our objection if
we change our mind.
Thanks !  Kerri

Attached is a mini dash that summarizes the proposed deal to grant a license for POPS to AEP.  Please review and let me know of any issues, questions or concerns.
Yesterday evening AEP sent some last minute changes to the license agreement primarily dealing with arbitration.  I will be meeting with Barbara Gray and my counterpart from AEP, Dave Banks, tomorrow to nail down this agreement.  I'd like to get signatures on Friday so that we can move forward with getting our first payment and then start the process of delivering the application.
On a related note there have been some issues between AEP and Enron on the commercial side of the business.  Louise Kitchen and Eric Vanderwalde are involved in working through those issues.  Brian Redmond has asked that we call him before executing this agreement.

Hi again!

The LABC has been able to get a discount of $100 on the tour price from Executive Tours, thus lowering the total price to $2,369 in Double Occupancy and $2,885 in Single Occupancy. However, the discount will apply ONLY if we get a minimum of 10 registrants.

The tour has more than five registrants so far, and the new lower prices will apply to new passengers as well as currently registered passengers.  In case the tour do not get a minimum of ten passengers, anyone who registers may request a full refund of their deposit.

Because of these new price cuts, we have extended the deadline to November 2.  Executive Tours must receive deposits and registrations no later than November 2.

If you need more information or want to sign up for the trip please call Richard Price at 1-800-521-0070 or (714) 897-0074, or send him an email to exectours@earthlink.net.

As you may know, last week NiMo announced that, in response to PSC resistance, they were terminating their agreement with Tractabel, which had won an RFP to supply power to NiMo to meet it's customers full requirements over the next five years. Part of that deal would have transferred all of NiMo's PPAs and transitional contracts with their divested generation owners to Tractabel as well. Enron had responded to the RFP but our proposal was not particularly aggressive since we thought the RFP as defined by NiMo  made little sense.

Seeing an opportunity here, I just spoke with NiMo's Chairman and CEO, Bill Davis (whom I had previously worked with for many years while at the State Energy Office) about Enron's interest in assisting NiMo in managing its power and gas portfolio, now that the Tractabel deal is dead. I suggested setting up a meeting at which our Gas (Frank) and Power (John) folks would be present, and offered that we could agree to a confidentiality Agreement if he thought one was needed. Bill did not reject the idea of a meeting and said that he would talk to his people and get back to me. I'll follow up with Bill in the event I haven't heard back from him by the end of next week. (This week's shot due to Thanksgiving.)

A cabbie picks up a nun. She gets into the cab, and the cab driver won't
stop staring at her. She asks him why is he staring and he replies, "I have
a question to ask you but I don't want to offend you."  She answers, "My
dear son, you cannot offend me. When you're as old as I am and have been a
nun as long as I have, you get a chance to see and hear just about
everything. I'm sure that there's nothing you could say or ask that would
find offensive."
"Well, I've always had a fantasy to have a nun kiss me."
She responds, "Well, let's see what we can do about that: #1, you have to be
single and #2 you must be Catholic."
The cab driver is very excited and says, "Yes, I am single and I'm Catholic
too!"
"OK" the nun says "Pull into the next alley" He does and the nun fulfills
his fantasy with a kiss that would make a hooker blush. But when they get
back on the road, the cab driver starts crying. "My dear child, said the
nun, why are you crying?"
"Forgive me sister, but I have sinned. I lied, I must confess, I'm married
and I'm Jewish."
The nun says, "That's OK, my name is Kevin and I'm on my way to a Halloween
party."

I was thinking about what to get Dad for Christmas and I think what he would like most is a family portrait.

Joan has talked to Leigh-Leigh Baillio about taking pictures of the family. The sitting fee is $85 (if other family units want pictures it would be an additional $20 per family plus the cost of film). The cost per picture varies by the size and quantity ordered. Joan is getting actual prices from Leigh-Leigh. As a rough estimate, Joan spent about $300 on three 8x10's plus some smaller prints.

I thought we could take the portrait after Jim & Marianna's second baby is born . . . maybe the weekend of her baptism? . . . so there wouldn't be any actual money paid until the Spring. If that's a problem, instead of a Christmas present, we could give him the portrait for a combination father's day/birthday present.

I'm headed to Houston right now. Call me at mom's or we can talk about it at John's house on Wednesday.

EES is fine with the Org. chart below. I understand the $6.4 million is total for both ENA & EES. Comments:

1.) Need a recommended split of the $6.4 million for ENA/EES.
2.) I understand the $6.4 million includes $0 for Outside Services. The OOC of ENA/EES needs to approve as these services are needed.
3.) The $6.4 million does include legacy real estate costs. Jim Fallon is the coordination point on our real estate costs-is this on his radar screen?
4.) We need to reconcile what we do with Steve Montovano. Because both ENA/EES want to utilize him, I might suggest leaving him in the regulatory group so that both groups can effectively utilize him. Louise/Jim- are you both OK with this? If so, Rick/Jim, I would suggest putting him in the NE Gas Box.
5.) Rick, I understand you're talking with Kean/Whalley on handling the Washington office activity in Corp. I agree.

The comments reflect input from Christi, Dave Perrino, Steve Walton, Mike Roan, Andy and Charles.  Please review the sections where you have had input to make sure we adequately reflected your points, but please also review the entire document and let us know your thoughts.
I'm still filling in cites and Bernadette will be working on the formatting, but the document is hopefully in pretty good shape.  There is no filing deadline for these comments, but we would like to submit them on Monday if possible.  It shouldn't take more than an hour to review.  In sending your comments, please "Reply to All" so everyone receives your comments.
Thanks for everyone's help.
Susan:  we should also have Kevin review the comments
Alan:  Tim should probably review the comments as well, but check with Dave and Steve to see if the "LMP in the West" argument is correct before you show him the comments.

MEET ME IN THE STAIRWELL

You say you will never forget where you were when you heard the
news on September 11, 2001. Neither will I.

I was on the 110th floor in a smoke filled room with a man who
called   his wife to say "Good-Bye." I held his fingers steady as he
dialed.

I gave him the peace to say, "Honey, I am not going to make it,
but  it  is OK...I am ready to go."

I was with his wife when he called as she fed breakfast to their
children. I held her up as she tried to understand his words and
as  she realized he wasn't coming home that night.

I was in the stairwell of the 23rd floor when a woman cried out to
Me  for help. "I have been knocking on the door of your heart for 50
years!" I said. "Of course I will show you the way home -- only
believe in Me now."

I was at the base of the building with the Priest ministering to
the  injured and devastated souls. I took him home to tend to his Flock
in  Heaven. He heard my voice and answered.

I was on all four of those planes, in every seat, with every
prayer.   I was with the crew as they were overtaken. I was in the very
hearts  of the believers there, comforting and assuring them that their
faith   has saved them.

I was in Texas, Kansas, London. I was standing next to you when
you  heard the terrible news. Did you sense Me?

I want you to know that I saw every face. I knew every name --
though not all know Me. Some met Me for the first time on the 86th floor.

Some sought Me with their last breath.
Some couldn't hear Me calling to them through the smoke and
flames;

"Come to Me...this way...take my hand." Some chose, for the final
time, to ignore Me. But, I was there.

I did not place you in the Tower that day. You may not know why,
but   I do. However, If you were there in that explosive moment in time,
would you have reached for Me?

September 11, 2001, was not the end of the journey for you. But
someday your journey will end. And I will be there for you as
well.   Seek Me now while I may be found. Then, at any moment, you know
you  are "ready to go."

I will be in the stairwell of your final moments.

God

OUR FATHER

During the next 60 seconds, stop whatever you are doing, and take
this
opportunity. (Literally it is only 1 minute)

All you have to do is the following:

You simply say and "Our Father" for the person that sent you this
message:

Our Father who art in Heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name, Thy Kingdom
Come,
Thy Will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day
our
daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who
trespass against us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us
from evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory,
forever
and ever AMEN.

Next, you send this message to everyone you know. In a while, more
people will have prayed for you and you will have obtained a lot
of
people praying for others.

Next, stop and think and appreciate God's power in your life, for
doing what you know is pleasing to Him. If you are not ashamed to
do
this, follow the instructions.

Jesus said, "If you are ashamed of me, I will be ashamed of you
before
My Father."

If you are not ashamed, send this message ... only if you believe.

"Yes, I love my God. He is my fountain of Life and My Savior. He
keeps me going day and night. Without Him, I am no one. But with
Him, I can do everything. Christ is my strength."

This is a simple test. If you love God and you are not ashamed of
all
the great things that he has done for you, send this to everyone
you
know, and the person that sent it to you.

AMEN, and God Bless Us All.....

This morning after I left home, my son Joshua had a fever convulsion and passed out.   Zane called 911 and believing Josh wasn't breathing, gave him mouth to mouth until his breathing stabilized.     Josh is okay now, but he has a severe inner ear infection.      The emt's sent Zane to our pediatricians office, where they immediately examined Josh and did blood work.     His white blood count is extremely elevated, which apparently is normal after the trauma of a seizure after such a fever spike.    They are home now, but my husband is quite shaken and so am I.    I'm not really up to discussing this today.

To make a long story short, I plan to catch the 2:30 p.m. bus home today.    I will be back in tomorrow at 7:00 a.m. and at full speed.   I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause.

Greg, David,

While I think you guys have come to some conclusions about layoffs, it is the people we need to keep we need to address now.  We will provide you a list of those that are crucial to keep going forward.

I am extremely concerned about one person in particular--Rob Fuller.  I have done everything I can over the last weeks to make sure he knows we are committed to him, however market rumors are that he could be close to leaving.  We now have to commit to him with dollars on a piece of paper, and any help you can provide tomorrow would be helpful.  I don't think this is a next week issue.

Shanna, I will coordinate with you on the HR front to get Oxley's feedback.

Thanks for your attention.

week that we might be bringing a filing to the Commission but that it was
just at the notice threshold--will  mention, as well,  to the other two
Commissioners in meetings next week.  While we could possibly play with the
numbers and/or timing of the filing to get below the 1% threshold, my
inclination is to make a simple informational filing out of an abundance of

Janet -

1.	The best split is probably just 50/50 on personnel.  While everyone is in a specific box on the org chart, many if not all of the people are flexible enough that they can cover different roles.  The $ on outside services may be able to be split differently going forward (for example, if EES wants something specific on a state PUC matter).
2.	In terms of approving outside service expenditures, I would like to sit down with you, Louise, and Rick to work out what the best method of working through the approvals.  I will try and set up some time the first week of December.
4.	I have put Steve Montovano in the NE Gas box.  This will increase the budget by $400k (based on historical figures).  I have attached a new org chart to represent this change.

Also, Dan Staines (who is not on the Org Chart) has an Employment contract that ends 6/12/2002.  Dan has been working on Florida and Northeast RTO matters and continues to help East Power with the NYISO TCC auction.  We can sever him, but his contract will need to be paid off ($87k).  Govt Affairs also has a contract for support with Joe Connor (ex-Southern exec) to support our SE activities.  I am trying to get a copy of the contract, but I think that it is in place until 8/02.  My recommendation is to use these guys through their contracts instead of a large payment today.

Thanks,

Jim

ST. MARTINVILLE, La. -- Former Dallas Cowboys star Nate Newton was
arrested when police confiscated 213 pounds of marijuana from a
van on a highway.

Newton and two others were charged Sunday with possession with
intent to distribute marijuana, Trooper Willie Williams said
Tuesday. A fourth person, arrested in a separate vehicle with
$18,000, was charged with conspiracy to possess narcotics.

All four were in the St. Martin Parish Jail on Tuesday with bail
set at $200,000 each.

Newton is a six-time Pro Bowl offensive lineman who helped Dallas
win three Super Bowls. He spent 14 seasons in the NFL, 13 with
Dallas. He retired last year after a season with Carolina.

Williams said a state police patrol pulled over a van for a
traffic violation on Sunday about 6 a.m. east of Lafayette.

"The driver seemed nervous and gave consent to search the van,"
Williams said. He did not say who was driving.

Cardboard boxes filled with 213 pounds of marijuana were in the
van, Williams said.

Newton, who lives in East Ellijay, Ga., was arrested along with
Faye Cleveland, 46, and Marva Johnson Waye, 49, both of
Jacksonville, Fla. All three were charged with possession with
intent to distribute marijuana.

The driver of a pickup truck, Ricky Glenn Williams, 46, of
Quinlan, Texas, was charged with conspiracy to possess narcotics,
police said. The $18,000 that was in the truck with him was
seized, the trooper said.

A couple of items of note from this weeks IEPA call:

1. As noted in Steven Kelly's recent e-mail, it looks like Commissioner Laurie is planning to leave the CEC at the end of the year.  The only siting case before him is Roseville, so Kelly thinks it is unlikely he will stay to see the case completed.  Commissioner Moore's term is also up at the end of the year.  Kelly thinks he will try to get an extension on his term 'till his siting cases are complete.  As I think we can all guess, Kelly is not optimistic about the replacements that might be named by Davis to fill their spots.
2. The proceeding to modify the siting rules seems to be at a bit of a stalemate.  Commissioner Purnell has put forward some draft language to try to break the log jam.  IEPA is getting a copy to send out.
3. Kelly thinks the critical issues that are going to be addressed in the CPUC IRP process are:
a. The market design issues surrounding procurement practices by utilities (assuming they regain this ability from DWR)
b. Procurement of renewables
IEPA is planning to file to be a participating party to these proceedings.  If Enron wants to be a party separately we need to file a letter to that intent by Nov. 9th .  Steven thinks this time around PG&E and Sempra might be on our site on the generation issues b/c of their IPP businesses.

Let me know if you have any questions on these issues.  I'll keep you updated as things move forward.

I have left a message with Tracy Geaccone last month.  Penalty and Interest is not included for any amounts below.

The auditor is in the process of being promoted.  The auditor has issued tentative amounts and I had some challenges that we have been discussing.  The auditor will not issue a formal assessment until January, unless I push him for a number.

The following are potential exposures and issues:

COMPRESSOR FUEL ($370,000 Penalty and Interest is not included)

It is too soon to know a specific tax assessment amount for this issue.  We will probably be assessed; but, I submitted a rough draft of my position challenging the entire assessment on compressor fuel.  He would not discuss an official position for this issue.  If compressor fuel is assessed,  I will be protesting the Price assigned to Compressor fuel (San Juan Hub - Spot Market) and the fact that local tax that was imposed.  It would be speculative to guess the probability of success in winning either of these challenges.


ASSETS (The revised jeopardy assessment was reduced from $600,00 to $292,000 Penalty and Interest is not included)

The primary assessment was imposed upon the September 1996 purchase of the La Plata facility.  After our tour, the auditor reduced the "Revised Jeopardy" assessment by 50%.  I submitted a rough draft position regarding items that remained.

The Enron Debacle
Byzantine deals have shattered the energy outfit's credibility

Executives at high-flying Enron Corp. (ENE ) never seemed overly concerned with how the rest of the world viewed their business practices. Earlier this year, the California Attorney General had to get a court order to collect documents in an industrywide investigation into energy price fixing. And when an analyst challenged former CEO Jeffrey K. Skilling in a conference call to produce Enron's balance sheet, Skilling called him an "ass----." Still, even some Enron executives worried that the company had gone too far with two complex partnerships set up in 1999 to buy company assets and hedge investments. With Enron's then-chief financial officer acting as general manager of the partnerships and in a position to personally benefit from their investments, the potential for a conflict of interest and backlash from investors seemed overwhelming. "Internally, everybody said this is not a good idea," says a source close to the company.

But no one could have predicted such a jaw-dropping outcome for the nation's largest and most innovative energy trader. Since Oct. 16, when Enron revealed a $35 million charge to earnings to reflect losses on those partnerships and was forced to knock $1.2 billion off its shareholders' equity, the company's stock has plunged 60%. The Securities & Exchange Commission is investigating Enron's accounting for its partnerships and whether it properly disclosed them to investors.

Suddenly the company, which brought high-tech and complex finance to energy trading, is essentially trying to avoid a run on the bank. Moody's Investors Service has already downgraded the company's debt. Enron says it is meeting with credit agencies to calm their fears, and analysts say Enron is working on a turnaround plan that would likely include accelerating asset sales, issuing shares, and obtaining new credit lines. Enron's board has set up a special committee to look into its controversial partnerships. But analysts also worry that Enron's trading partners could pull the plug if they lose confidence that it can honor its trades.

"ON CRACK?" Inside Enron, once-cocky employees are reeling. They were still puzzling over the abrupt Aug. 14 departure of CEO Skilling when the company announced on Oct. 24 that CFO Andrew S. Fastow, architect of the controversial private LJM investments--which got their name from the first initials of his wife and children--was removed from his post and on leave. In a tense meeting held at a Houston hotel after the latest financial disclosures, soft-spoken Chairman and CEO Kenneth L. Lay faced 1,600 employees, with another 5,000 hooked up via the Web. One irate worker asked if he was "on crack." Lay, an economist by training, turned over day-to-day management in 1997. Until Skilling quit, citing personal reasons unrelated to Enron, Lay was talking about retirement, sources say. Now he is facing his biggest fight ever. "Ken is looking at a 30-year career of accomplishment going down in flames. This is just awful," says one friend.

On the surface, at least, Enron's off-balance-sheet maneuvering hardly seems the stuff that would crater a company. Amazingly, sources close to Enron claim that one rationale for Fastow's deals was to save an estimated $30 million a year in investment-banking fees. Fastow's involvement in the partnerships, which bought assets from Enron, including stakes in telecom and energy, was supposed to make the deals simpler for the investment bankers and thus cheaper. They were also meant, according to sources close to the company, to hedge Enron's investments in potentially risky assets while allowing it to maintain some control over them. Enron says Fastow made money for himself on some of the deals, but insiders insist there were less controversial ways to enrich him if that were the aim. Fastow did not return calls seeking comment. Lay, who declined to comment for this story, has said that the partnerships were properly vetted by Enron's attorneys and internal and external auditors and were approved by its board. A source familiar with Enron agrees: "We had the best lawyers in the world saying, `It looks fine."'

But whatever Enron's reasons for creating the LJM partnerships, the problems were compounded by scanty disclosure. The deals were first revealed in a 1999 proxy, raising concerns from investors and analysts. By this summer, when Enron's stock was falling and its bets in broadband were souring, complaints about LJM grew louder. So in June, Fastow pulled out of the partnerships. When the write-offs came, Enron enraged analysts and investors further by failing to disclose the hit to equity in its third-quarter earnings press release. Instead, Lay mentioned it in a conference call with analysts. "We found it disconcerting that the company waited to disclose the additional $1.2 billion charge to equity in a fleeting comment in the middle of its conference call," says UBS Warburg analyst Ronald Barone.

BAD BETS. Still, Enron's credibility did not vanish overnight. Analysts have been lobbying for years for more information about how and where Enron makes its money in its often byzantine trading business. While the company's revenues were soaring from $9.2 billion in 1995 to $100.8 billion in 2000 and its stock was returning 500% during the same six-year period, Enron's aggressive, even arrogant managers could ignore Wall Street's complaints with impunity. But after its stock price collapsed this year (chart), the company's attitude and operational missteps quickly caught up. And there was plenty to worry about. The company's $3 billion power plant in India wasn't paying its bills amid a political controversy; its highly ballyhooed business for trading high-speed communications capacity was crippled by the telecom industry meltdown; and its calamitous foray into the water business with Azurix Corp. has already cost Enron at least $574 million in write-offs.

These bad bets and the expensive LJM shock have investors worried about what else might be lurking at Enron. Many aren't sticking around to find out. "I think the lack of disclosure on their financial engineering killed the credibility of the management team," says Richard A. Giesen, who manages the Munder Power Plus fund, which dumped its Enron shares about a month ago.

It's not clear just how many off-balance-sheet financing vehicles Enron has used over time. Some were created years ago to finance oil and gas producers. Analysts and sources close to the deals say there's no particular risk in these to Enron shareholders. Other interconnected entities, such as Whitewing, Osprey, Atlantic Water Trust, and Marlin Water Trust, were a way to get assets no longer central to Enron's strategy off its balance sheet, freeing capital and credit for the core energy business and ventures like broadband (table).

To entice institutional investors such as pension funds and insurers into these deals, Enron promised to kick in equity if asset sales weren't enough to cover debt. Such "mandatory equity" deals have been used by at least a half-dozen others in the energy and telecom industries, including El Paso (EPG), Williams, and Dominion, says Standard & Poor's director Todd A. Shipman. "Nobody's going to find anything that's particularly unique or below board" in such deals, says one investment banker specializing in the energy business.

Worst case, which Shipman considers unlikely, Enron could be on the hook for about $3 billion in its mandatory-equity deals. That could mean diluting its shares by more than 25% at today's prices. Analyst John E. Olson at Sanders Morris Harris Inc. (SMHG ) figures a 9% dilution is more likely. Even if this $3 billion in debt were included on Enron's balance sheet now, the debt-to-capital ratio would climb to 54% from about 49% at the end of June. Such a change would pressure Enron's credit rating but not push it below investment grade, says Shipman.

HUGE HIT. Fastow's LJM, a private equity fund, was a different kind of animal, according to sources familiar with the arrangements. It bought energy and other assets from Enron, which booked gains and losses on those deals. LJM was also involved in complex hedging that was supposed to reduce the volatility of some of Enron's investments, including stakes in high-tech and telecom businesses and an interest in New Power Co., which markets power to consumers. When Enron terminated these deals in September, it took the $1.2 billion hit to equity.

But the more immediate question is whether trading partners will stick with the company. The first place that might show up is in Enron's highly successful online platform, which trades everything from gas and electricity to weather derivatives. To reassure its partners, Enron is scrambling to shore up its liquidity. It has already tapped $3 billion in credit lines and is trying to arrange another $1 billion. Shipman says he has seen no signs of massive customer defections or drastically worsened credit terms. Still, rival traders are wary. "We certainly have taken a closer look at Enron in the last week to 10 days and will continue to manage the credit risk, but we're still doing business with the company as usual," says Keith G. Stamm, CEO of power and gas trader Aquila Inc. (ILA )

"SPEEDING TRAIN." Still, with the stock battered and rating agencies considering further downgrades, that could rapidly change. In recent days, the uncertainty about Enron's future has reduced investors' appetite for Enron debt. "No one wants to speculate on the direction or their likelihood of survival," says a credit-derivatives salesperson. "It's really difficult to get in front of a speeding train."

Even if Lay can calm his trading partners, he and his management team face a much tougher task of restoring their credibility on Wall Street. With the stock now hovering around $14--down from a high of $90 in August, 2000--some even believe that Enron could be a takeover target for the likes of GE Capital or Royal Dutch/Shell Group. (RD ) Both declined to comment. Would Enron sell? One source close to the company says Enron has talked about possible mergers and strategic alliances in the past with Royal Dutch/Shell, among others. "If they're really worried about liquidity, they might take the easy way out," he says.

If Enron does pull through this crisis, some suspect it will be a humbler, more risk-averse place. The company that once believed it could expand its trading and logistics empire to all manner of commodities--from advertising space to steel--will be forced to scale back its grandiose visions. That's something some investors applaud. "The company should focus on its strengths," says William N. Adams, senior energy analyst at Banc of America Capital Management, a major shareholder. But that's a far less exciting place than Enron's energy cowboys ever hoped to roam.

Derivatives Danger?
http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757081.htm
Lately, owners of Enron's (ENE) equity, bonds, and loans have been struggling to understand how exposed the company is to risks of losses that they didn't know about before. Now, as a fuller picture of Enron's entanglements with partnerships begins to emerge, investors have something else to worry about: credit default swaps, known as CDSs for short.

That's financial marketspeak for insurance on bonds and bank loans. Their owners pay a premium for coverage that reimburses them for any losses they have if their investments go bad. The CDS market has existed only for about two years, but it's growing fast. Goldman, Sachs & Co. (GS ) and others estimate that bonds and loans with a face value of between $1 trillion and $1.5 trillion are covered. Not surprisingly, big banks with hefty balance sheets such as J.P. Morgan Chase (JPM  ), Merrill Lynch (MER ), and Deutsche Bank (DB ) dominate the market.

Enron, however, is a player--and the only significant one that isn't also a bank. Competitors say that although Enron has issued only between $500 million and $700 million worth of CDSs so far this year, it had ambitious plans to offer them online. "They don't belong in this market," says one trader. "They don't understand the implications." Enron did not return calls seeking comment.

Of course, neither Enron nor others will have to pay out unless the loans and bonds they're insuring turn bad. Trouble is, this year is potentially a doozie for losses on corporate debt. Corporate defaults could reach a record of $100 billion, says Standard & Poor's, like BusinessWeek a unit of The McGraw-Hill Companies. Regulators say shaky bank loans hit a record $193 billion by early October.

If Enron has insured any of the bad debt, it might have to take charges for losses if they exceed the premiums it has been getting. With all that has been happening in recent weeks, that's the last thing it needs.

Commentary: Enron's Clout Won't Sway the SEC
http://www.businessweek.com/premium/content/01_46/b3757082.htm
For Securities & Exchange Commission Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, the SEC's investigation into Enron Corp. (ENE) could hardly have come at a worse time. The future of Pitt's ambitious agenda of reforms in securities regulation could depend on how well he handles this case.

Enron's political clout and close ties to President George W. Bush create real risks for the SEC. Enron CEO Kenneth L. Lay is a longtime Bush backer, and the company was the biggest corporate contributor to the President's campaign. A Bush appointee, Pitt is attempting a delicate balancing act. He has made it clear he wants to speed up the SEC's enforcement, in part by rewarding companies that cooperate with probes. But he insists the SEC will still come down hard on true corporate miscreants--and knows that any signs of let-up could jeopardize the rest of his reform agenda.

Enter the Enron probe. The fine shadings of securities enforcement--where most cases are settled by negotiated penalties, not court-imposed fines--often make it hard for outsiders to tell whether the SEC is being tough or lenient. But Pitt must go out of his way to make it clear that the Enron case is handled by the book--getting the same strict scrutiny from the SEC as any other, less connected company.

For now, top SEC aides say that's happening. The SEC Enforcement Div. in Washington is looking into whether Enron adequately disclosed to shareholders the risks of its complex deals with Andrew S. Fastow, the company's former chief financial officer. Agency insiders say Pitt and his fellow commissioners will be briefed on the case as it proceeds. But they insist Pitt hasn't heard from the White House or Enron's other political allies.

TOP LOBBYIST. Enron's connections are numerous. Besides Lay's links to Bush, an Enron director, Wendy Lee Gramm, is the wife of Texas Senator Phil Gramm, top Republican on the Senate Banking Committee. And Enron spreads its lobbying budget--$2.13 million in 2000--across both parties. Just this year it hired four lobbying firms with Democratic roots. Enron says it lobbies heavily because it operates in regulated industries. It notes that electric utilities outspend it 35 to 1.

On Oct. 31, a special committee of Enron's board hired William R. McLucas, former SEC enforcement director, to represent it. McLucas should know that any attempt to muscle the stock cops is likely to backfire. Pitt, who joined the SEC out of law school in 1968, "remembers how the [Nixon-era] SEC tainted itself by turning a blind eye to [fugitive financier] Robert Vesco," says an agency veteran. Pitt has too much riding on the Enron probe to let its connections sway his judgment.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


The call was pretty tough.
Quick side bar:  Edison is very concerned about TURN getting a stay from the court on the EIX/PUC settlement .
At the start of the call, Fielder said that he'd fax me the judge's ruling in the TURN appeal, but based on how the call went, I'm not sure if he'll send it.
As we conjectured sometime back, Edison is indeed talking about charging us (through a reduced PX credit) for our "share" of the undercollection.
Our "share" would be paid down through a reduction in the PX credit over the life of the settlement (presumably about 2-3 years).
In short, with one hand Edison would pay us what they owe us; with the other hand, Edison would take it back.
Edison intends (as we conjectured) to base the amount of the undercollection owed by DA customers on the percentage of load they represent (e.g., if DA is (was) 10% of the load, they would pay for 10% of the undercollection).
We had a very "animated" discussion that went back and forth for some time.
I told him that there's been some gross misunderstanding since his proposal simply doesn't track.
Fielder said that they believe their argument is solid.
Here's how we left it--he's going to get back to us by COB today or tomorrow and tell us what Edison's calculation is of our "share" of the undercollection.
We can discuss further on the call that Wanda's setting up for tomorrow.

If you have any questions between now and then, 	give a holler.

Best,
Jeff

John,

As you are aware, there was some confusion on the 2 Peoples trades we did on 10/15/01.  We did not find out there could be a problem until yesterday, 15 days after the trade was input into the system.  I consider this unacceptable so I wanted to find out what happened to our processes internally.

A person named Richard in the physical confirm area was the one that let Amy know the trade wasn't a financial trade but a physical trade.  I called him to ask him why it took 15 days to find this out.  He said that the deal was entered into as a financial deal so he didn't know about the trade until yesterday.  The person in charge of financial confirms is Diane Anderson and I called her to ask what happened.  She said she didn't know but would check into it.  She left me a message yesterday evening saying that for about 5 days in October they were shorthanded and they didn't confirm any financial trades.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE,  especially in the situation we are currently in.  I haven't talked to her again but I wanted you to know about this.  Not to put any more problems on your desk, but this needs to be fixed.

Amy yesterday found a person at Peoples that knows the trades as we know them (financial).  So the trade is okay, but it could have been a $500,000 hit to Mike's book.

Please let me know if I can do anything.  Thanks.

John

Wanted to share the latest communication on NETCO. This is all good news and exciting to see that things will be moving on a fast track from this point forward. I will be pulling you together and asking for some information to meet the plans and deadlines listed below.

For a start please review your pipe coverage that is planned on your desk with the NETCO team you will have to work with and forward me that breakdown. I know you took a preliminary look at this but I want you all to rethink and give me a "final or startup" list. The list you gave me on the contracts required for NETCO on the pipelines has been consolidated and is being reviewed. I believe we need to take a look at some of the Intrastates and key LDC's and get that info on the list. Seating plan should be simple once we get a better handle on the layout for 5 & 6. I'll try and get some details today. Don't know if we will be allocated spots on 6. IT systems layout and structure is already being planned/discussed. Most likely we will get involved in some testing once they start laying out the new architecture.

In addition any other items for a re-start that you can think of please forward to me.

Of course we still have the major hurdle of securing a buyer and once/if we do what do they actually submit a bid to purchase. Let's be optimistic and hope they are interested in the NETCO structure that has been laid out. Regardless we still need to do all of the tasks listed below to get ready.

Thanks - Bob

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise
These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.
The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen
First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

Raj Vaswani, the general counsel for Kiodex, called me to pass along two messages:

1.	If a new  joint venture is created to resurrect EnronOnline, Kiodex would be interested in pursuing a business relationship with the new joint venture.  I told him that it was much too early to predict whether this would be of interest to a new trading company, but I told him I would relay Kiodex's interest to you.

2.	Kiodex may be interested in repurchasing the shares in Kiodex currently owned by Enron Net Works LLC.  He did not know what the price would be, but wanted to know if we would be interested.  Since Net Works is a filed company, we would probably have to get the bankruptcy court's approval to sell.   I assume that if the price is right we are interested in pursuing this.  Let me know.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


My child, Dane, was previously enrolled in Enron Kids.  Since I was laid off last Monday, I had to take him out.  I understand through Lorraine Gibbs that the daycare has now opened up to the public.  What is the possibility of coming down on the monthly charge?

I think it would be a nice gesture to the parents that previously had kids enrolled there to be able to bring their child(ren) back instead of having to enroll them into another daycare.  I understand that I will not be able to pay $560 a month since Enron will not be subsidizing, but it would be nice if Enron could lower the rate to $600 per child.  Enron Kids is a wonderful place with wonderful teachers.  It would be a shame to have to close such a facility.

Please consider this.  It would be very important to several parents if they could have their child(ren) back downtown at the same daycare.

I know that there are many parents interested in bringing their child back to Enron Kids.  I also have talk to other downtown parents who would possibly be interested in brining their child downtown if the rate was lowered.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Mike,

Embassy Natural Gas is the operator for POI 4879 - Vantage Plainview.  John Wollaston is the contact 915-685-4103.  Embassy purchased gas from ENA (2,500 dth/day) to service Azteca Milling, LP - This is a $250 million  plant that mills flour for tortillas - one of the largest employers in Midland, TX.

ENA was transporting the gas on their contract for Embassy.  They had a hedging deal : TOK index plus 15cents ($2.08 + .15) - present day ($2.95).  He is concerned that he will have to go out and pay more $ for gas.  I  put him in touch with Kevin Brady (3-7750) with ENA and Kevin gave him the marketer Jason Williams (3-1929) to contact about Embassy getting in touch with the upstream supplier for ENA so that they could perhaps buy the gas directly and hopefully at the same price.

I don't know the outcome of their conversation.

I thought your group might be able to help him.  I have not mentioned this possiblilty to him.  Would you let me know if you plan to pursue?

Call me if you have questions.

Jean

Gerald, I attach a copy of the current form of master physical gas agreement ECC has in place with CNR.  Randy will send you a credit worksheet in the next half hour.  Can you make sure that your form of master has the triangular setoff language that Mark Haedicke distributed a month or so ago to be included in all agreements, as CNR wants to ensure there is cross-affiliate setoff.  Once it is prepared, Howard Sangwine, the commercial contact in Calgary, will walk the document over to CNR, so you can send it to me and I will get it to him.
Thanks for your help.

Fallon has requested a DPR be prepared 2X a week for positions that we are executing on (active/live positions only, no terminations or deals we are not executing on).  We have put together the shell of how this DPR will look.  To start this process we are planning to present to him positions (column E) and PRM value (column X) as of 1/23.  To do this, we have laid out the following steps:

- we need to get the PRM values directly from you (column X)
- we will run the benchmarks and need to work with you to ensure you are happy with the benchmark numbers we have pulled from RMS (the exception is gas, we need the gas risk group to provide the gas bench to us)
- we need all of then exceptions/qualifications to your numbers
- we will need the other information in the schedule to be reported to us starting next week, but not for this exercise

Please confirm to me/Shona that you can get us this info by 230 pm today.

Lastly, I am attaching the unofficialized book list as these books will not make it into the benchmarks and need you to confirm that there are no 3rd party positions in these books.

Thanks in advance

I agree with your choice.  However, considering Ray is local and it will not cost us anything (e.g., conference fee) to have him attend, I think that is a great suggestion.  Also, I'm still hoping that Sarah will be able to attend as well as she is local too.  I'll contact Ray on Monday.  Take care and Happy Thanksgiving.

Something to brighten your day!  And remember to keep in touch!


******************************************************************************************

Jake, the rancher, went one day to fix a distant fence.
The wind was cold and gusty and the clouds rolled, gray and dense.

As he pounded the last staples in and gathered tools to go,
The temperature had fallen and the snow began to blow.

When he finally reached his pickup, he felt a heavy heart,
From the sound of that ignition, he knew it wouldn't start.

So Jake did what most of us would do, if we'd have been there.
He humbly bowed his balding head and sent aloft a prayer.

As he turned the key for the last time, he softly cursed his luck.
They found him three days later, frozen stiff in that old truck.

Now Jake had been around in life, and done his share of roamin'.
But when he saw Heaven, he was shocked - it looked just like Wyomin'.

Of all the saints in Heaven, his favorite was St. Peter.
[Now, this line, it ain't needed but it helps with rhyme and meter.]

So they set and talked a spell or two, or maybe it was three,
Nobody was keeping' score--- in Heaven time is free.

"I've always heard," Jake said to Pete, "that God will answer prayer,
But one time I asked for help, and, well He just plain wasn't there.

Does God answer prayers of some, and ignores the prayers of others?
That don't seem exactly square - I know all men are brothers.

Or does he randomly reply, without good rhyme or reason?
Maybe, it's the time of day, the weather or the season.

Now I just ain't trying to act smart, it's just the way I feel,
And I was wonderin', could you tell me - what the heck's the deal?"

Peter listened very patiently and when Jake was done,
There were smiles of recognition, and he said, "So, you're the one!

That day your truck wouldn't start, and you sent your prayer a flyin',
You gave us all a real bad time, with hundreds of us a tryin',

A thousand angels rushed to check the status of your file,
But you know, Jake - - - we hadn't heard from you in quite a while.

And though all prayers are answered, and God ain't got no quota,
He didn't recognize your voice... and started a truck in South Dakota.

So, remember to keep in touch!

Read this & Send it back to me please
A philosophy professor stood before his class and had some items  in front of
him. When class began, wordlessly he picked up a large  empty mayonnaise jar
and proceeded to fill it with rocks right to the  top, rocks about 2"
diameter.
He then asked the students if  the jar was full? They agreed that it was.  So
the professor then  picked up a box of pebbles and poured them in to the jar.
He shook the  jar lightly. The pebbles, of course, rolled into the open areas
between the rocks.  The students laughed. He asked his students  again if the
jar was full? They agreed that yes, it was.
The  professor then picked up a box of sand and poured it into the jar. Of
course, the sand filled up everything else. "Now," said the professor,  "I
want you to recognize that this is your life.
The rocks are  the important things - your family, your partner, your health,
your  children - anything that is so important to you that if it were lost,
you would be nearly destroyed.
The pebbles are the other  things in life that matter, but on smaller scale.
The pebbles  represent things like your job, your house, your car.
The sand is  everything else. The small stuff.
If you put the sand or the  pebbles into the jar first, there is no room for
the rocks. The same  goes for your life. If you spend all your energy and time
on the small  stuff, material things, you will never have room for the things
that  are truly most important.  Pay attention to the things that are  critical
in your life.  Play with your children. Take your  partner out dancing. There
will always be time to go to work, clean  the house, give a dinner party and
fix the disposal. "Take care of the  rocks first-the things that really
matter. Set your priorities. The  rest is just pebbles and sand * Good Luck!
I hope it works.
*  May there always be work for your hands to do;
* May your purse always  hold a coin or two;
* May the sun always shine on your window pane;
* May a rainbow be certain to follow each rain;
* May the hand of  a friend always be near you;
* May God fill your heart with gladness  to cheer you.

"Oldy but Goody"


A Christmas  Tale
One particular Christmas a long time ago, Santa was getting ready  for his annual trip... but there were problems everywhere.
Four of his  elves got sick, and the trainee elves did not produce the toys as fast as the  regular ones, so Santa was beginning to feel the pressure of being behind  schedule. Then, Mrs. Claus told him that her Mom was coming to  visit.
This stressed Santa even more. Then when he went to harness the  Reindeer, he found three of them were about to give birth and two had jumped the  fence and were out, heaven knows where. More Stress.
Then when he began  to load the sleigh one of the boards cracked and the toy bag fell to the ground,  and scattered the toys.
So, frustrated, Santa went back into the house  for a cup of coffee and a shot of whiskey.  When he went to the cupboard,  he discovered that the elves had hidden the liquor and there was nothing to  drink.
In his frustration, he accidentally dropped the coffee pot and it  broke into hundreds of little pieces all over the kitchen floor.
He went  to get the broom and found that mice had eaten the straw it was made from. Just  then, the doorbell rang and Santa cussed his way to the door. He opened the door  and there was a little angel with a great big Christmas Tree.
The angel  said, very cheerfully, "Merry Christmas Santa. Isn't it just a lovely day? I  have a beautiful tree for you. Isn't it just a lovely tree? Where would you like  me to stick it?"
Thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of  the Christmas tree.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I just spoke with Hugh Connett of Bridgeline
Here's what happened:
1)  He wanted to make sure that we were OK with April minus 3 cents but he wanted to lock in the price on the March settlement date (Joe Parks suggests that we should lock in promptly after we get approval on the deal and not wait until the end of February - this probably works unless we can't get approval by the end of Feb.).  We should probably talk a bit more about this with Bridgeline;
2)  He is going to revise the term sheet and send it to us.  It will include (a) pad gas payment of $2.08MM and (b) B-Line to make Q4 2001 and Q1 2002 lease payments to Dow and pay any credits back to Enron (He needed to check on this but said that it sounded OK);
3)  He suggested that we should consider using $100k of the sales proceeds to fund the arbitration against TEPI (I asked him whether Bridgeline would be willing to fund the arbitration and he suggested this as an alternative); and
4)  We talked for a bit about the Storage/Transport Agreement - he said that they were willing to release the gas in storage to the extent that they are over-secured.  The big question is the value of the gas in storage.  I sought clarification on this because of our meeting this morning.  He said that he was going to figure out how much ENA owed under the Storage/Transport and then seek to convert that into an amount of gas.  Any gas in excess of that amount would be released.  In order to do this, however, he wants ENA to execute a document which makes it clear that by releasing the gas, Bridgeline is not waiving any rights that it might have to a warehouseman's lien on the gas in storage.  He is having their lawyer send a draft of this document to Gerald.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I have spoken with Calger about us going through the West Power contracts with his team next Tuesday through Friday.  They are gathering an extended set of information (including the items on the current matrix) on their top 25 exposures.  The top 25 exposures include the top exposures under Master agreements and in many cases include numerous contracts.  Chris said that the 26th exposure was about $10MM and one would need to get to about the 50th exposure to get below $1MM.  I asked him to forward down whatever they had completed to date so we could get educated and keep a central file.  He is also going to forward a call in number for a conference call tomorrow so we can begin to get educated on the current effort.

Lorraine Becker (ext. 31680) will be handling travel arrangements.  Please forward your credit card # so she can complete the reservations.
(P.S. Piper is getting verification from Bowen regarding travel expenditures.)

Michelle/Jeff,

John Donnolly, Head of HR this potential partner, asked me this afternoon for the following data. We have this and can send it, but can you confirm that it is ok:

Employment agreements for "top 5"
Summary of last 12 months total compensation (including Base, Bonus, LTI, Keysop, retention and contracts payments).

I promised to get this to him tonight or tomorrow.

Seems to me if they have signed a confidentiality agreement and we are close to a deal with them this maybe appropriate. I'd volunteer to take the names off and just have  our GIS numbers as a code, but suspect this will confuse everyone.

David

From ENE to ENRNQ to EBAY

Heavy load electricity prices in the Western U.S. continued their recent
rise amid ongoing below-normal temperatures and curtailed generation.  Some
parties also believed that stronger spot gas prices played a role in
strengthening up the Thursday/Friday package.  "The curtailment at Diablo
Canyon caused a chain reaction of higher prices around the West today.  We
have below-normal temperatures everywhere, and California is having to
import lots of power from outside the state," said one marketer.  In fact,
there was some talk that reserves in the Golden State could fall below
acceptable levels Wednesday evening, possibly leading to the first emergency
declaration since July 3, 2001.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures ended higher on
Wednesday, but displayed little reaction to the late release of the AGA
weekly storage report.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at 2.394$/mmBtu,
while March ended 9 cents higher at 2.363$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report
indicated that 137 bcf were pulled out of storage last week, right in line
with most industry estimates.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.529 tcf,
1.070 tcf, or 73 percent, above last year and 529 bcf above the five-year
average.  Of the 137 bcf drawn last week, only seven were taken out of the
Western Consuming Region, but recent cold weather had many players convinced
that next week's report would show a much larger draw in the West.  In other
industry gossip, David Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of the
Enron audit who was fired on Tuesday, met for several hours Wednesday with
lawyers and House of Energy and Commerce Committee staff.  The House Energy
committee was also looking to interview Sherron Watkins, the Enron executive
who wrote the prophetic letter last summer to Ken Lay warning him of big
troubles with the company's accounting policies.  Meanwhile, Enron shares
were trading on the Pink Sheets, an over-the-counter market in which
companies do not have to report financial performance.  On Wednesday, Enron
stock, which now trades under the symbol "enrnq", fell 20 cents to close at
31 cents.  Meanwhile, Enron stock certificates were selling for upwards of
$100 on Ebay due to their collectable value.  Quite a paradox, eh?

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest gained 1.25$/MWh on the high end,
largely due to cold temperatures locally, and reports of increased exports
to California.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 20 to 22.75$/MWh,
with the bulk of trades between 21.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts for
Chief Joseph remained strong at 100 kcfs Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next Tuesday and
Wednesday.  In unit news, Colstrip #3 and #4 (700 MW each) remained off
line, both with a revised ETR of January 20.  Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330
MW) also had its return date backed up until January 18.  Weather forecasts
were calling for below-normal temperatures to continue through the weekend,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal
temperatures across the entire region from January 22 through 26.

Amid predictions of cold weather on Thursday, rumors of reserves falling
below WSCC required levels, and stronger natural gas values, electricity
prices for the Thursday/Friday package strengthened on Wednesday in the
Golden State.  "Prices opened strong, but slid off some later.  There was
some excitement over the cold weather and stronger loads, and talk that the
CAISO safety margin might not be met across the peak tonight.  It's been a
while since we've seen emergency stages and out of market buying in
California," said one interested party.  Heavy load trades at SP15 were
heard from 28 to 30$/MWh, while light loads goods were being exchanged
between 18 and 19.75$/MWh, with odd-lot products heard at 17 and 20.25$/MWh.
In political news, PG&E ran a full page ad in the major California papers on
Wednesday, accusing the state of filing suit to stop the utility's
reorganization process and staunchly defending their own business practices
as "ethical and fair".  In unit news, Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) was down on
Wednesday, as was El Segundo #3 (337 MW).  Alamitos #4 (320 MW) returned to
the grid.   Temperatures were expected to dip just below freezing in the
capital and other mid-state interior load centers on Thursday.  The Bay Area
and southern regions of the state were only expecting lows in the upper-30s
to mid-40s.  Little change was forecast through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Below-normal temperatures and increased demand from California helped to
boost day-ahead peak power prices in the Southwest by as much as 3$/MWh on
Wednesday.  "They're [California] hurting for power today, and we've even
been asked to turn on some of our gas units to help get them through the
evening peak," said one Southwest utility trader.  Peak power at Palo Verde
saw action from 26 to 30.5$/MWh, with most trades heard in the 28.5 to
29$/MWh range.  Prices generally started on the low end, but quickly
ratcheted up as California players came out of the woodwork looking to
gobble up surplus supplies.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling
for below-normal temperatures to continue from January 22 through 26.

___________________________________________________________
As stronger natural gas prices, unit curtailments, and winter weather made
their presence felt, day-ahead electricity prices settled slightly higher
across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  While temperatures remained
cool, there was little change in the weather pattern since Tuesday, which
left traders perplexed about the source of Wednesday's strength,
particularly in the Midwest.  The AGA's weekly storage report listed a
withdrawal of 137 bcf, dead on with industry estimates of 135 to 140 bcf.
The AGA had little influence on late trading, and NYMEX Henry Hub gas
futures rose on Wednesday.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at
2.394$/mmBtu, while March rose 9 cents to end at 2.363$/mmBtu.

As imports dropped and rumors of output constraints on the PJM grid were
heard, peak power prices exhibited some tempered strength in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed
hands between 23.1 and 23.6$/MWh.  While sources were fairly certain that
the Salem and Keystone outages were finished, rumors circulated that a
different Pennsylvania unit was newly off-line on Wednesday, but no one was
certain exactly which one.  After a promising early spike to 80 and a two
hour mid-morning plateau above 30, LMPs settled lower for the afternoon and
averaged 26.05$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected in
the upper-40s on Thursday and lows were forecast in the mid-30s.  Cooling of
about five degrees was expected through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures in the north of PJM and
above-normal temperatures in the south from January 22 to 26.

Amid official word of a big nuke off the grid and higher natural gas prices,
heavy load energy costs gained significant ground in the Midwest on
Wednesday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead pieces were bought and sold from 19.35 to
22$/MWh, picking up over 3$/MWh on the high end.  The February contract also
traded much higher, with deals heard between 20.9 to 21.45$/MWh, up almost a
dollar to a day ago.  In unit news, Exelon confirmed the outage at their
Illinois Quad Cities #1 (821 MW) on Wednesday.  The unit has been down since
January 9 for repairs to a pump in the reactor vessel.  However, no ETR was
given.  High temperatures were forecast to reach the mid-30s on Thursday,
with overnight lows in the mid-20s.  The latest six-to-ten called for mostly
above-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Peak power prices were steady to slightly higher in the Southeast on
Wednesday.  Into Entergy trades were seen between 19 and 22$/MWh, slipping
towards the low end as the day progressed, while the front month contract
saw action mostly between 20.25 and 20.4$/MWh.  Into TVA deals were done
between 20 and 22.25$/MWh.  High temperatures were anticipated mostly in the
50s across SERC on Thursday, with little change expected through Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from
January 22 to 26.

Need Michelle to help categorise under headings I suggested. Michelle, if you agree with my analysis can I ask Kari just to resort these so I can give to Lavo tomorrow in that format?

Clearly, the below is useful, but what Lavo asked was, which ENA contracts do we really have little chance of enforcing or are in danger of defaulting under. As such while we know per below that some of attached we haven't delivered on, I want to make sure we give him an indication of whether that it itself mean we have no argument to enforce.

Managing Director
Morgan Stanley
Art Mbanefo
Managing Director

Carnegie Mellon Faculty in attendance:
Richard Bryant

John Lehoczky
Lord Professor of Statistics
Dean, College of Humanities and Social Sciences
Steve Shreve
Professor of Mathematical Sciences
The three new members of the board, Ashvin Chhabra,
Art Mbanefo and David Waldman, were asked to present their
perspective on future human resource needs of the industry.
David reported that Putnam relies on both fundamental
and quantitative analysis.  In fixed income markets,
he noted the shift from treasuries to mortgages and corporate
bonds, and pointed out the accompanying rise in
the importance of credit risk analysis.  Although Putnam
has been a major employer of MSCF students, he noted that
increased emphasis in our program on the asset management
industry would be welcomed.  He pointed out the need
for our students to understand how to translate theory
into practice and to communicate to audiences of
various backgrounds.  For David, applicants should be able
to pass the "airport test:"  if you are stuck with this guy
for half a day in the airport, will it be a reasonably
interesting experience.
Art also emphasized the key role of communication skills.
He wants people who are very focussed and who can find
practical solutions.  He welcomes applicants who have prior
accomplishments which show they can be trained and have
discipline.  He cited music and athletics as areas in which
these traits can be demonstrated.
Ashvin proposed that students should prepare for the "elevator
test:" if you happen to ride the elevator with a managing
director, between the sixth floor and the lobby can you
explain something to him in a way that he appreciates.  Ashvin
believes that MSCF students, and quants in general, must
either be able to work on the trading desk or have management
skills if they are to survive in the long term.  He expects
there to be growth in demand for people who understand
technology and business.  He thinks personal finance
services will also be an area of growth.
Echoing one of Ashvin's points, Joe would be interested in
people with the skills to manage IT projects.
Two subjects raised by Rick are whether the MSCF program should
specialize, say into energy or asset management, and whether
there should be additional courses in subjects such as
accounting and corporate finance.  The consensus was that
the MSCF program should stay general, within the quantitative
finance niche, and should remain highly quantitative rather than
tipping toward an MBA.
There was discussion of the desirability of internships.  Joe
pointed out that 80% of the Morgan Stanley hiring is from
internships.  An internship doesn't have to be for a summer;
eight weeks is possible.  Steve observed that we have not in
the past had difficulty placing students even though our program
does not include an internship and that an internship would
lengthen the program beyond 12 months.  Joe said that a
longer MSCF program with internships would permit different
student cohorts to overlap so new students could learn from those
who had interned.  Faculty would also be enriched by
students who had interned.

What is the word dudes?
Subject: Four Good Management Lessons!!
Lesson Number One
*****************
A crow was sitting on a tree, doing nothing all day.
A small rabbit saw the crow, and asked him,
"Can I also sit like you and do nothing all daylong?"
The crow answered: "Sure, why not."
So, the rabbit sat on the ground below the crow, and rested.
All of a sudden, a fox appeared, jumped on the rabbit and ate it.
Management Lesson:
To be sitting and doing nothing, you must be sitting very, very high up.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Two
*****************
A turkey was chatting with a bull.
"I would love to be able to get to the top of that tree,"sighed the turkey,
"but I haven't got the energy.
"Well, why don't you nibble on some of my droppings?" replied the bull.
"They're packed with nutrients."
The turkey pecked at a lump of dung and found that it actually gave him
enough strength to reach the first branch of the tree.
The next day, after eating some more dung, he reached the second branch.
Finally after a fortnight, there he was proudly perched at the top of the
tree.
Soon he was promptly spotted by a farmer, who shot the turkey out of the
tree.
Management Lesson:
Bullshit might get you to the top, but it won't keep you there.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Three
********************
When the body was first made, all the parts wanted to be Boss.
The brain said,
"I should be Boss
because I control the whole body's responses and functions."
The feet said,
"We should be Boss
as we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.
" The hands said,
"We should be the Boss
because we do all the work and earn all the money."
And so it went on and on with the heart, the lungs and the eyes....
until finally the asshole spoke up.
All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss.
So the asshole went on strike,
blocked itself up and refused to work.
Within a short time the eyes became crossed, the hands clenched,
the feet twitched, the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered.
Eventually they all decided that the asshole should be the Boss,
so the motion was passed.
All the other parts did all the work while the Boss just sat and passed out
the shit!
Management Lesson:
You don't need brains to be a Boss - any asshole will do.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lesson Number Four
*******************
A little bird was flying south for the winter.
It was so cold, the bird froze and fell to the ground in a large field.
While it was lying there, a cow came by and dropped some dung on it.
As the frozen bird lay there in the pile of cow dung,
it began to realize how warm it was.
The dung was actually thawing him out!
He lay there all warm and happy, and soon began to sing for joy.
A passing cat heard the bird singing and came to investigate.
Following the sound, the cat discovered the bird under the pile of cow dung,
and promptly dug him out and ate him!
Management Lessons:
1) Not everyone who drops shit on you is your enemy.
2) Not everyone who gets you out of shit is your friend.
3) And when you're in deep shit, keep your mouth shut!

Leon,  I received a phone call from out in the blue
from Asif Hasan.  Asif was Mr. Herring's personal
assistant in the early eighties or maybe even the last
seventies.  Of course I mentioned the HNG Alumni to
Asif and said I would get him on the mailing list.
His contact information is:
22461 Gravino
Laguna Hills, CA  92653
stocknfund@aol.com
(949)699-6690
He had asked about Gilbert Lafuente and Eddie Garza
and I informed him that they had passed away.  I
couldn't remember all the history from your emails
over the last few years to tell him what has happened.
Do you keep a log that can be sent out to Asif?
May God bless everyone this holiday season.

Jenny - Thanks for your help with Comanche.  As a result of some of the earlier work we are now interested in further review of a few individuals.  Could you have your team pull as much of the historical e-mail as possible for the following:
terrie_james@enron.net
Please advise how far back you can go with this.  Also, we would like to include this name in a mailsweeper filter for future e-mail traffic.

We do want to compartment this a little from our overall Comanche effort so we ask that you help us with a second mailbox for this material.  My boss, Scott Tholan, will be the lead on the second mailbox and needs your help getting started.  Could you help him with the following:
A.) Add the current mailbox, mbx_projcomm, to his desktop.
B.) Create a second Comanche mailbox with the above filter and add to his desktop.
C.) Install the pst viewing software on Scott's machine
D.) Provide the above historical e-mail to Scott

Scott can be reached on 58889 should your team need to contact him.  We are on a very short timeframe and need to accelerate this as soon as possible so we greatly appreciate your help.  As always, thanks for your support and please let one of us know if you have any questions.  Thanks, Rus

Stations 3,4 and 5.  I spoke with Danny Collier of the EPA today, Friday, November 30, 2001 and he has instructed me that the EPA is to receive copies of all monthly water well sampling for C/S 3,4, and 5 in addition to sending the monthly sampling results to Yolanda Barney of the Navajo Nation. Although Yolanda is the primary recipient, the EPA becomes secondary as they have the responsibility for oversight of Indian Lands environmental issues.  Danny said that the EPA would eventually phase themselves out of the Navajo's business but until they do, he is requesting copies of all sampling data.  I asked him if we could fax him the monthly reports and he indiacted that it would be OK to do so.  His fax number is (415) 947-3549.  I will keep you apprised of any future changes in the distribution of the water sampling reports.

Umbrella is still requiring this type of information to be scheduled.  Although our position is currently not to provide it, we may alter the position and I am trying to get a head start since the time frames are shortening.  They will eventually want this on all counterparties, but we can start with the top twenty.  Further, early next week Andy Alter wants to discuss how we will contract initially.  Mark Taylor and I will discuss this with him, but it will be vital to have contact information ready sooner rather than later.  Thanks for your help.

Bill and Marcus,

Per your conversation with Mike Pechin this afternoon, attached is our
preferred EEI Cover Sheet (which I have changed slightly since the last
draft, the changes are shown in red-lined format), the form of amendment of
our guaranty in your favor (referenced in the cover sheet), and the service
agreement we need you to sign because of our obligation to file something
with FERC authorizing our sales to you under the new EEI.  Marcus can
explain to you the reason for the latter documents, and I believe he is
agreeable, although I have not heard back from him on the language of the
guaranty amendment -- we had discussed the concepts.

We want to stress that it is very important for us to conclude this ASAP as
drafted, including having the box for credit assurances checked.  The only
alternative we would consider is a voluntary closeout of the forward
positions along with the attached EEI Agreement without the box for credit
assurances checked.

I am out of the office tomorrow morning, but will be back in the afternoon,
but if you can call us tomorrow in the morning, Mike will know how to reach
me.  Mike's number is 610-765-6729.

Thanks, and we look forward to hearing from you.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Following the discussions I have had with Louise and Jay, this is the proposed solution to the interest rate risk management in NEWCO.

1. For the first few weeks ( to a few months) we continue to use Infinity to update the curves at 2 PM. I will need to have one trader to execute, mark curves and do any deals for foreign exchange (Cd$ etc.). Louise, I hope you have this in your budget and headcount. I will need one junior trader(and maybe two as things grow) to help do this job.  I have lined up one of the guys in the old trading desk, if this goes forward.

2. In the first few weeks, Jay Webb and myself are hoping to acquire a lighter, and much simpler interest rate package which will allow us to do what we do, with significantly lower costs. We also will re-design the way we aggregate interest rate risk in the commodity books, to make it simpler and easier. To ensure there is no more discussion ever of drift-reallocation, I propose a method where, every desk head gets back his complete interest rate portfolio drift every month or quarter (less any transaction expenses ).  I would expect that, the interest rate curve shift will be small till we build a somewhat longer dated portfolio, while the drift could start becoming substantial pretty quickly (as we start making money).

Hope this answers the questions. We will have the curves at the right time, done by the trading group. We will still measure and manage our own exposure to both interest rates and currencies.  We intend to allocate small VAR to that risk management. We would deal primarily with one or two counterparties - the parent bank and a couple of futures brokers to manage the risk.

Just to be very clear, while I am happy to manage this risk (with extra help), I am primarily  interested in the running of power options and structured products.

In December, he called again, and we missed one another, but I finally told, via voicemail, that we would entertain and consider and offer to buy Willow Farms but that we would not consider any kind of partnership or joint venture and we wanted a straight sale.  I then told him that if he was still interested that he should give it his best shot, and we would consider whatever he sent us.

My Discussion of 1/30/02

John called me back on 1/17/02, and I returned his call today.  I told John the following:

1.  The group is still interested in whatever he would propose, but I wanted to make some things clear so he didn't think we were wasting his time.

2.  I told him that in reality, all don't want to sell, but 2 out of 3 do, and I won't stand in the way of a satisfactory sale.

3.  We still do not want to participate in any development or sale, the price cannot be dependent on success of sales and a sale must be all or nothing.  I told him that I could not agree to any sale that allowed a "cherry picking" of good lots and left other lots behind, because once sales started it puts pressure to complete the development or else all prices suffer under perception of "undesirable" development.

4.  I told him that the only reason we are having this discussion now is that due to the property tax revaluations the carrying costs of the lots has increased.  Therefore, any sale must be structured to take that carrying cost pressure off, hence, a sale of all or nothing.

After stating these ground rules, I told him that I would understand if he wasn't interested, but that if he was, he should just give us his "best" proposal.

He then asked how many lots, and I told him 8 with a 9th possible, but owned only by my mom.  He said let's keep that out for now.  I also told him that within the next 2 years, the lot with the house might also be sold, but that that was up to my parents.

He then said the following:

1.  He is interested too in reducing his risk, so he might be interested in deal where he would guarantee the purchase of 2 lots every year for 4 years.  It would be a guarantee.

2.  He asked me if we had any idea of the value we wanted for the lots.  I said there are different ideas and no consensus, so I said I had no number to give him.  I reiterated to him that he knows more than me (since I'm just a lawyer in Denver) and he should give it his best shot.

I then commented to him on his suggestion:

1.  I told him that any deal that did not ensure sale of all lots was just not acceptable, so the extent of his guarantee of 2 lots per year had to be firm as to 8 lots over 4 years to even be considered.  I told him then it would appear just to be a means of financing the sale (not reducing his risk) and allowing us to keep title to the unsold lots rather than tie them up with a mortgage.

2.  I told him that his proposal may not be worth considering if it allowed the kind of cherry picking I referred to above and the kind of pressure to pick up the remaining lots at lower prices that I referred to above. I told him to consider these concerns in his proposal.

3.  I told him that because what brought us to the table now is the increased carrying costs of the lots, any proposal by him that still puts pressure on us to carry these lots and expend finds, will not be well received.  For example, I told him that I have some concern that any 2 lot per year deal will result in immediately increased carrying costs resulting from revaluation of the remaining lots for property tax purposes based upon the first purchases.  I told him that that would not be well received by us.

How We Ended It

I told him that I wanted to make clear my concerns so that he doesn't waste his time and feel resentful if we reject his offer. I told him that I wanted to be above board and that my reputation was important to me. He said he understood and appreciated the details.

He said he will put a proposal together, and I told him to send it to Leonard at the office, since I am not good at being the middleman.

Let me know if I goofed up or did ok.

- Dan
1/30/02

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


ENRON ADMITS IT'S REALLY ARGENTINA
Now Massive Ineptitude, Corruption Make More Sense, Analysts Say
Houston, Texas - Collapsed due to gross mismanagement and insurmountable
debt, energy company Enron today confessed to what many observers had
long suspected: it is actually Argentina.
Congressional leaders, who have called for an investigation into the
biggest corporate failure in U.S. history , immediately dismissed
Enron's claim, but Argentinians weren't so sure. "The shady deals. The
crazy debt. I knew there was something familiar about those guys," said
Banco del Argentina director Ernesto Caballo.
Enron chairman and CEO Kenneth Lay, speaking through an interpreter via
phone from Buenos Aires, apologized for any confusion the subterfuge may
have caused, and noted that as a sovereign nation, the company was
immune from U.S. prosecution. Lay also insisted that he had not "fled"
to Argentina, but had returned home to the capital to visit "mi
familia."
While not directly stating it, Lay also hinted that he might in fact be
Argentinian President Fernando de la Rua. Reached in Buenos Aires, de la
Rua admitted he couldn't rule that out. "Things are pretty crazy around
here. Who can say?"
But Enron creditors, clients, and shareholders, who stand to lose
billions over their exposure to the company, weren't buying any of it.
"While they may act like it, they are not a South American country, and
Ken Lay is not the President of Argentina," declared J.P. Morgan Chase
spokesman Alex Firtilly. "They are a malfeasant U.S. corporation that
has potentially caused us to lose $500 million. And Ken Lay is from
Missouri."
"Como?," Lay replied. "No hablo Ingles."
Recently ranked as high as No. 7 on the Fortune 500 list of the largest
U.S. companies, Enron literally ran itself into the ground  by fudging
its books, making secretive deals that enriched company insiders, and
relying too heavily on debt. Though it was formed in 1986 with the
merger of Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth, Enron became Argentina
only recently, said Lay, "on the advice of our attorneys."
That counsel came none too soon. As a South American state, all pending
U.S. and European lawsuits are rendered harmless. And the company
escapes what had been a daily fusillade of scorn from its former home.
Indeed, much as the French were baffled by America's obsession with
President Clinton's sexual affairs, many South Americans say they don't
understand why Enron and its leaders have been vilified. As former
Colombian President Ernesto Samper explained: "In the United States, you
look at corruption as an abomination We look at it as an art."
EXTRADITION DENIED
The U.S. State Department has refused to recognize Enron as Argentina,
and a spokesman said the Bush administration has officially requested
the extradition of Lay and the officers who allegedly fled with him.
Argentina, however, denied the request, explaining that an entire
country cannot be extradited. And besides, they added, Lay had pledged
to help pay off the nation's $132 billion debt.
Asked where the bankrupt Enron got such a sum, Lay explained that after
proclaiming its nationhood status, the company had received an emergency
IMF loan. An IMF spokesman later confirmed the payment.
"From what we knew of their fiduciary practices, Enron appeared to have
all the hallmarks of a typical IMF fundee," said IMF communications
director Nestor Svingen. "At first, we did balk when they asked for $232
billion, but when they explained that some of the money would go to
repay overdue IMF loans, we thought, 'Oh, that's all right then.'"
"Not that we actually expect to see any money from anyone," Svingen
added. "It's just this little game we all play. Great fun if you like
numbers. Do you enjoy quadratic equations? I could do them all day."
Asked what Enron/Argentina had pledged to do with the extra $100 billion
it requested, Svingen said the application had specified funding for
"civic infrastructure improvements."
"That usually means the president is going to build a palace," Svingen
explained.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


this is an old one but a great one.
If you dont like this email, then you just don't understand.



A chronology of events for Saturday,  December 4, 1999,
and the early morning hours of Sunday,
December 5, 1999:
6:00 Arise, play the Eyes of Texas and
Texas Fight at
full-freaking blast
6:20 Get in car, drive to New Braunfels

7:30 Tee off (me and a buddy were the
FIRST tee-time
of the morning)
8:50 Turn 9 (crack open first beer)
8:53 Crack open second beer
8:58 Crack open...(you get the idea)
10:30 Finish 18 (holes, as well as
beers), sign
scorecard for smoooooth 95
10:35 Headed for San Antonio
10:50 Buy three 18-packs for pre- and
post-game
festivities
11:10 We decide we don't have enough
booze, so we
double-back to a liquor store and buy
the good ol' 750
ml plastic bottle "Traveler" Jim Beam
11:50 Arrive at the tailgate spot.
Awesome day. Not
a single cloud in the sky. About 70
degrees.
11:55 I decide that we're going to kick
the shit out
of Nebraska.
11:56 I tell my first Nebraska fan to
go fuck
himself.
12:15 The UT band walks by on the way
to the
Alamodome. We're on the second floor of
a two-story
parking garage on the corner (a couple
hundred of us).
We're hooting and hollering like
wildmen. The band
doubles back to the street right below
us and
serenades us with Texas Fight and The
Eyes of Texas.
AWESOME MOMENT.
12:25 In the post-serenade serendipity,
50-100 grown
men are bumping chests with one
another, each and
every one of them now secure and
certain of the fact
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska.
1:00 The Nebraska band walks by on the
way to the
Alamodome. Again, we hoot and holler
like wildmen.
Again, the band doubles back and stops
right below us
to serenade us, this time, however,
with the Nebraska
fight songs. Although somewhat
impressed by their
spirit and verve, we remain convinced
that we are
going to kick the shit out of
Nebraska.
1:30 I begin the walk to the Alamodome,
somehow
managing to stuff the "Traveler" and 11
cans of beer
into my pants.
1:47 I am in line surrounded by
Nebraska fans. They
are taunting me. I am taunting back,
still certain
that we are going to kick the
shit out of Nebraska. I
decide to challenge a particularly
vocal Nebraska fan
to play what I now call and will
forever be remembered
as "Cell-Phone Flop Out." Remember flop
out for a
dollar? The rules are similar. I tell
this Nebraska
jackass that if he's so confident in
his team, he
should "flop out" his cell phone RIGHT
NOW and make
plane reservations to Phoenix for the
Fiesta Bowl.
And then I spoke these memorable words:
"And not
those
damn refundable tickets, either! You
request those
non-refundable, non-transferrable
sons-of-bitches!"
He backs down. He is unworthy. I call
Southwest
Airlines and buy two tickets to
Phoenix,
non-refundable
and non-transferrable. Price: $712. He
is humbled.
He lowers his head in shame. I raise my
cell phone in
triumph to the cheers of hundreds of
Texas fans. I am
KING and these are my subjects. I
distribute the 11
beers in my pants to the cheering
masses. I RULE the
pre-game kingdom.
2:34 Kickoff. Brimming with confidence,
I open the
Traveler and pour my first stiffy.
2:45 I notice something troubling:
Nebraska is big.
Nebraska is fast. Nebraska is very
pissed off at
Texas.
3:01 The first quarter mercifully ends.
9 yards
total offense for Texas. Zero first
downs for Texas.
I'm still talking shit. I pour
another stiffy from
the Traveler.
3:36 Four minutes to go in the first
half: the
Traveler is a dead soldier. I buy my
first $5 beer
from the Alamodome merchants. While I
am standing in
line, a center snap nearly decapitates
Major
Applewhite
and rolls out of the end zone. Safety.
3:56 Halftime score: Nebraska 15, Texas
0. I wish I
had another Traveler.
4:11 While urinating next to a Nebraska
fan in the
bathroom at halftime, I attempt to
revive the classic
Brice-ism from the South Bend bathroom:
"Hey, buddy,
niiiiiiiiice cock." He is
unamused.
4:21 I buy my 2nd and 3rd $5 beer from
the Alamodome
merchants. I share my beer with two
high school girls
sitting behind me. Surprisingly, they
are equipped
with a flask full of vodka. I send them
off to
purchase $5 Sprites, so that we may
consume their
vodka. I have not lost faith. Nebraska
is a bunch of
pussies.
4:51 No more vodka. The girls sitting
behind me have
fled for their lives. I purchase two
more $5 beers
from the Alamodome merchants.
5:18 Score is Nebraska 22, Texas 0. I
am beginning
to lose faith. This normally would
trouble me, but I
am too drunk to see the football field.

5:27 I call Southwest Airlines: "I'm
sorry, sir.
Those tickets have been confirmed and
are
non-refundable and non-transferrable."
5:37 I try to start a fight with every
person behind
the concession counter. As it turns
out, the
Alamodome has a policy that no beer can
be sold when
there is less than 10 minutes on the
game clock. I am
enraged by this policy. I ask loudly:
"Why the fuck
didn't you announce last call over the
fucking PA
system??!!"
5:49 Back in my seats, I am slumped in
my chair in
defeat. All of a sudden, the Texas
crowd goes
absolutely nuts. "Whazzis?," I mutter,
awaking from
my coma, "Iz we winnig? Did wez scort?"
Alas, the
answer is no, we were not winning and
we did not
score.
The largest (by far) cheer of the day
from the Texas
faithful occurred when the handlers
were walking back
to the tunnel and Bevo stopped to take
a gargantuan
shit all over the letters "S",
"K", and "A" in the
"Nebraska" spelled out in their end
zone. I cheer
wildly. I pick up the empty Traveler
bottle and stick
my tongue in it. I am thirsty.
6:16 Nebraska fans are going berserk as
I walk back
to the truck. I would taunt them with
some off-color
remarks about their parentage, but I am
too drunk to
form complete sentences. With my last
cognitive
thought of the evening, I take solace
in the fact that
if we had not beaten them in October,
they would be
playing Florida State for the national
championship.
6:30 Back in the car. On the way back
to Austin for
the 8:00 Texas-Arizona tip off. We can
still salvage
the day! I crack open a beer. It is
warm. I don't
care.
7:12 We have stopped for gas. I am
hungry. I go
inside the store. I walk past the beer
frig. I
notice a Zima. I've never had a Zima. I
wonder if
it's any good. I pull a Zima from the
frig. I twist
the top off and drink the Zima in three
swallows.
Zima
sucks. I replace the empty bottle in
the frig.
7:17 There is a Blimpie Subs in the
store. I walk to
where the ingredients are, where the
person usually
makes the sub. There is no one there. I
lean over
the counter and scoop out half a bucket
of black
olives. I eat them. I am still hungry.
I lean
further over the counter and grab
approximately two
pounds of Pastrami. I walk out of the
store
grunting and eating Pastrami. The
patrons in the
store fear me. I don't care.
8:01 We are in South Austin. I have
been drinking
warm beer and singing Brooks and Dunn
tunes for over
an hour. My truck-mate is tired of my
singing. He
suggests that perhaps Brooks and Dunn
have written
other good songs besides "You're Going
to Miss Me When
I'm Gone" and "Neon Moon" and that
maybe listening to
only those two songs, ten times each
was a bit
excessive. Perhaps, he suggests, I
could just let the
CD play on its own. I tell him to
fuck off and
restart "Neon Moon."
8:30 We arrive at the Erwin Center. My
truckmate,
against my loud and profane
protestations, parks on
the top floor of a nearby parking
garage. I tell him
he's an idiot. I tell him we will never
get out. I
tell him we may as well pitch a
fucking tent here. He
ignores me. I think he's still pissed
about the
Brooks and Dunn tunes. I whistle "Neon
Moon" loudly.
8:47 I am rallying. I have 4 warm beers
stuffed in
my pants. We're going to kick the
shit out of
Arizona.
9:11 Halftime score: Texas 31, Arizona
29. I am
pleased. I go to the bathroom to pee
for the 67th
time today. I giggle to myself because
of the
new opportunity to do "the bathroom
Brice." There are
no Arizona fans in the bathroom. I am
disappointed.
I tell myself (out loud) that I have a
"Niiiiiice
cock." No one is amused but me.
9:41 I walk to the bathroom while
drinking Bud Light
out of a can. Needless to say, they do
not sell beer
at the Erwin Center, much less Bud
Light out of a can.
I am stopped by an usher: "Where did
you get
that, sir?" I tell him (no shit):
"Oh, the
cheerleaders were throwing them up with
those little
plastic footballs. Would you mind
throwing this away
for me?" I take the last swig and hand
it to him. He
is confused. I pretend I'm going to the
bathroom, but
I run away giggling instead. I duck
into some
entrance to avoid the usher, who is now
pursuing me.
I sneak into a large group of people
and sit down.
The
usher walks by harmlessly. I am
giggling like a little
girl. I crack open another can of Bud
Light.
9:52 I am lost. In my haste to avoid
the usher, I
have lost my bearings. I have no ticket
stub. I
cannot find my seats. Texas is losing.
10:09 Texas is being screwed by the
refs. I am
enraged. I have cleared out the seats
around me
because I keep removing my hat and
beating the
surrounding chairs with it. A concerned
fan asks if
I'm OK and perhaps I shouldn't take it
so seriously.
I tell him to fuck off.
10:15 After the fourth consecutive
"worst fucking
call I have EVER seen," I attempt to
remove my hat
again to begin beating inanimate
objects. However, on
this occasion I miscalculate and I
thumbnail myself in
my left eyelid, leaving a one-quarter
inch gash over
my eye. I am now bleeding into my left
eye and all
over my shirt. "Perhaps," I think to
myself, "I'm
taking this a bit seriously."
10:22 I am standing in the bathroom
peeing. I'm so
drunk I am swaying and grunting. I have
a bloody
napkin pressed on my left eye. My pants
are bloody.
I have my (formerly) white shirt
wrapped around my
waist. I look like I should be in an
episode of Cops.
10:43 Texas has lost. I put my bloody
white shirt
back on my body and make my way for the
exits. I am
stopped every 20 seconds by a good
samaritan/cop/security guard to ask me
why I am
covered in blood, but I merely grunt
incoherently and
keep moving.
10:59 With my one good eye, I have
located the
parking garage. I walk up six flights
of stairs,
promise that when I see my friend I
will punch him
in the face for making me walk up six
flights of
stairs, find the truck, and collapse in
a heap in the
bed of the truck. I look around and
notice that
traffic is lined up all the way around
the garage, six
whole flights, and no one is moving. I
take a nap.
11:17 I awake from my nap. I see my
friend in the
driver's seat. I lift my head to look
out the bed of
the truck and notice that traffic is
lined up all the
way around the garage, six whole
flights, and no one
is
moving. I am too tired to punch my
friend. I call my
friend a "Stupid fuck."
11:31 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:38 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:47 I lift my head to look out the
bed of the truck
and notice that traffic is lined up all
the way around
the garage, six whole flights, and no
one is moving.
I call my friend a "Stupid fuck."

11:58 I am jostled. The truck is
moving. I lift my
head to look out the bed of the truck
and notice that
traffic is beginning to move on the
second floor. I
jump out of the truck, walk to the edge
of the parking
facility, and pee off the sixth floor
onto the street
below. My friend looks at me like I
just anally
violated his minor sister. I turn
around and pee
on the front of his truck while singing
the lyrics
to "Neon Moon."
12:11 We are moving. We are out of
beer. I jump
from the truck and go from vehicle to
vehicle until
someone gives me two beers. I am happy.
I return to
my vehicle.
12:26 We have emerged from the parking
facility. We
make our way to my apartment and find
Ed sitting on
the couch with a freshly opened bottle
of Glenlivet on
the coffee table in front of him. We
are all going to
die tonight.
12:59 We have finished three-quarters
of the bottle
of Glenlivet. We decide it would be a
wonderful idea
to go dancing at PollyEsther's. Ed has
to pee. He
walks down the hall to our apartment
and directly into
the full length mirror at the end of
the hall,
smashing it into hundreds of pieces. We
giggle
uncontrollably and leave for
PollyEsther's.
1:17 The PollyEsther's doorman laughs
uncontrollably
at our efforts to enter his club.
"Fellas," he says
in between his fits of spastic
laughter, "I've been
working this door for almost a year.
I've been
working
doors in this town for almost 5 years.
And I can
honestly say that I ain't never seen
three drunker
mother fuckers than you three.
Sorry, can't let you
in." We attempt to reason with him. He
laughs
harder.
1:44 We find a bar that lets us in. We
take two
steps in the door and hear "Last call
for alcohol!" I
turn to the group and mutter: "See, dat
wasn't that
fuckin' hard. Day don't fuckin' do that
at the
Awamo...the awaom...the
alab...fuck it, that stadium
we
was at today..." We order 6 shots of
tequila and
three beers.
2:15 Back on the street. We need food.
We hail a
cab to take us the two and one half
blocks to Katz's.
The cab fare is $1.60. We give him $10
and tell him
to keep it.
2:17 There is a 20 minute wait. We give
the hostess
$50. We are seated immediately.
2:25 We order two orders of fried
pickles, a Cobb
salad, a bowl of soup, two orders of
Blueberry
blintzes, two Reuben sandwiches, a
hamburger, two
cheese stuffed potatoes, an order of
fries, and an
order of onion rings.
2:39 The food arrives. We are all
asleep with our
heads on the table. The waiter wakes us
up. We eat
every fucking bit of our food. Most
of the restaurant
patrons around us are disgusted. We
don't give a
shit.
The tab is $112 with tip.
2:46 I'm sleepy.
9:12 I wake up next to a strange woman.
She is the
bartender at Katz's. She is not pretty.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


I just got off the phone with Mac Miller, SWPC's attorney.  I told him that the January 8 extension was a surprise to my business client, who was not inclined to agree to it.  However, my client wanted the following information ASAP:
1.  An estimated cost of producing and shipping the discovery requested from SWPC.
2.  The earliest possible time frame on getting the documents and interrogatory answers from SWPC.
Miller, not surprisingly, said that this was a surprise to him, but I made clear that my instructions from my client were very firm, and he understood that.  Miller did say that this put him in a bit of a bad position, as SWPC had apparently initially not wanted to agree to any extension, and play "hard ball", and he convinced them otherwise.
Miller was in the middle of about three urgent projects, but we agreed we would speak tomorrow morning when he was less rushed and he could give me a realistic time frame for production.
Miller said he thought what he had from SWPC did include a document that showed when the DDP was paid.  Miller first said that we wouldn't like the answer, because it was before the damage, then said he really couldn't say that, because he didn't know.   Otherwise, he has not requested the customs brokers' file yet, which is in Houston, and will not give me authority to speak with the customs broker about this (nor would I have expected him to).  I got the impression that SWPC itself may not yet have sent Miller all the documents responsive to the DDP/Export House discovery requests.
In the morning, I will have our copy service come over and review the documents we will need to produce (since I have not had a chance to review the file for responsiveness, we may not have to produce everything, and may spend less money than the estimate reflects) to SWPC.   Also, I am not familiar with the discovery requested by SWPC that may be due; for instance, whether it includes interrogatories for which we need to draft answers and have someone available who can sign.   I will get my arms around this in the morning and then call you.
Let me know if there is anything else I can do.

Power enjoyed fishing and boating all week with Grandpa and Renee while Judy,
Paul and Marydith flew to Atlanta.  Marydith's first flight.  The good news
is there's nothing much to say about her flying.  Also not much of any delays
due to extra security.  Not to be unpatriotic but I think a few of the new
rules are the same ones the airlines have been trying to pass for a while but
couldn't until they could claim security.
Savannah was nice.  Kind of like our weekend last Oct in Arkansas.  Lots of
old buildings and tourist type shops.
Judy is gearing up for the big bash on Bolivar next weekend.  The kids and I
have not made any definite plans.
In a no where else but TX story.  I rode my bike tonight out through the
flood plain.  I came across a small herd of cows.  The half on the left got
startled and ran across the bike path and the group on the right crossed the
other way so I ended up looking like the slot man on the Blue Angels as I
emerged from the crossing cows.  Having had fun on the way South I realized
the only way home at night is back North on the same path so about 10 minutes
later I come back to find the bull standing across the path.  Remembering the
old adage normally said about dogs "Speed is Life" I played chicken with him
keeping the option open to cut behind him.  He blinked and moved off the
path.
John, any plans for next weekend?

her girlfriends when an exceptionally tall, handsome, extremely
sexy young man entered. He was so striking that the woman could
not take her eyes away from him. The young man noticed her overly-attentive
stare and walked directly toward her. Before she could
offer her apologies for being so rude for staring, the young man
said to her. "I'll do anything, absolutely anything,
that you want me to do, no matter how kinky, for $20. on one condition."

Flabbergasted, the woman asked what the condition was. The young man
replied, "You have to tell me what you want me to do in just three words."

The woman considered his proposition for a moment, withdrew from

pressed into the young man's hand along with her address. She
looked deeply into his eyes, and

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Hello Everyone,
Well, I looked around again for another inexpensive  ski trip for us to take this year.  The path has seemed to lead the same  direction as it did last year.  Lake Tahoe is by far the cheapest  package deal I can find.  I have already spoken to most of you who went  last year and everyone seems to agree it was a good time and great  atmosphere.  The dates for this adventure are leaving the evening of  January 30th (Wed.) and returning on Febuary 3rd (Sun.).
The vacation package is through Southwest Airlines  Vacations.
We will stay at the Horizon Casino for 4  nights.
We will depart:
Houston Hobby Airport @ 4:50 pm with a short stop  in Las Vegas and arrive into Reno at 9:20 pm.  We will then go by Charter  bus to Lake Tahoe.
Leaving Lake Tahoe:
Our plane will depart Reno at 12:10 pm on direct  route to Houston arriving at 6:50 pm.
And you ask how much for all this  excitement?
This can be all yours for 359.75 per person.   This price is for two people per room.  I will need to know who would like  to go no later than Wednesday  afternoon so I can set up reservations.  These  trips are booking fast.  We will be able to do like last year.  I will  call in the reservations and then each individual person will be able to call  Southwest directly and bill the trip to their own credit card.  The only  other expenses to be prepaid are for ski lift tickets and roundtrip transfer  from the airport to the hotel and back.  This cost is $30.  I figure  we will discuss the lift ticket options.  Some people may want to  Snowmobile a day or do something else.  We will discuss these options  further after the trip is set.
Hope to see everyone there.  The snow is  looking good up there so far.  They had 24" on the mountain  yesterday.
Mason is going.  I just don't have his e-mail  address but he said to count him in.

2. Two boll weevils grew up in South Carolina.  One went  to Hollywood and
became a famous actor. The other stayed behind in the cotton  fields and
never amounted to much. The second one, naturally, became known as  the
lesser of two weevils.
3. Two Eskimos sitting in a kayak were  chilly, but when they lit a fire in

5. Did you hear about the  Buddhist who refused Novocain during a root
canal?
He wanted to transcend  dental medication.
6. A group of chess enthusiasts checked into a hotel  and were standing in
the lobby discussing their recent tournament  victories.  After about an
hour, the manager came out of the office and  asked them to disperse. "But
why?", one asked, as they moved off. "Because,"  he said, "I can't stand
chess nuts boasting in an open foyer."
7. A  woman has twins and gives them up for adoption. One of them goes to a
family  in Egypt and is named "Ahmal." The other goes to a family in Spain;
they name  him "Juan." Years later, Juan sends a picture of himself to his
birth mother.  Upon receiving the picture,  She tells her husband that she
wishes she  also had a picture of Ahmal.  Her husband responds,  "They're
twins!  If you've seen Juan, you've seen Ahmal."
8.  These friars were behind on their belfry payments, so they opened up a
small  florist shop to raise funds. Since everyone liked to buy flowers from
the men  of God, a rival florist across town thought the competition was
unfair. He  asked the good fathers to close down, but they would not. He
went
back and  begged the friars to close. They ignored him. So, the rival
florist
hired  Hugh MacTaggart, the roughest and most vicious thug in town to
"persuade"  them to close. Hugh beat up the friars and trashed their store,
saying he'd  be back if they didn't close up shop. Terrified, they did so,
thereby proving  that Hugh, and only Hugh, can prevent florist friars.
9. Mahatma Gandhi,  as you know, walked barefoot most of the time, which
produced an   impressive set of calluses on his feet.  He also ate very
little, which  made him rather frail and with his odd diet, he suffered from
bad breath.  This made him ....what? (Oh, man, this is so bad, it's good) ..
A super  callused fragile mystic hexed by halitosis.
10. And finally, there was a  man who sent ten different puns to friends,
with the hope that at least one  of the puns would make them laugh.
Unfortunately, no pun in ten  did.

FOR MEN TIRED OF RECEIVING MALE-BASHING JOKES

How many men does it take to open a beer?
None.  It should be opened by the time she brings it.
----------------------------------------
Why is a Laundromat a really bad place to pick up a woman?
Because a woman who can't even afford a washing machine will probably never
be able to support you.
----------------------------------------
Why do women have smaller feet than men?
It's one of those "evolutionary things" that allows them to stand closer to
the kitchen sink.
----------------------------------------
How do you know when a woman is about to say something smart?
When she starts her sentence with "A man once told me..."
----------------------------------------
How do you fix a woman's watch?
You don't.  There is a clock on the oven.
----------------------------------------
Why do men break wind more than women?
Because women can't shut up long enough to build up the required pressure.
----------------------------------------
If your dog is barking at the back door and your wife is yelling at the
front door, whom do you let in first?
The dog, of course.  He'll shut up once you let him in.
----------------------------------------
What's worse than a Male Chauvinist Pig?
A woman who won't do what she's told.
--------------------------------------
I married Miss Right.
I just didn't know her first name was Always.
----------------------------------------
I haven't spoken to my wife for 18 months:
I don't like to interrupt her.
---------------------------------------
Scientists have discovered a food that diminishes a woman's sex drive by
90%.
It's called a Wedding Cake.
----------------------------------------
Marriage is a 3-ring circus: Engagement Ring, Wedding Ring, Suffering.
----------------------------------------
Our last fight was my fault: My wife asked me "What's on the TV?"
I said, "Dust!"
----------------------------------------
Why do men die before their wives?
They want to.
----------------------------------------
A man inserted an advertisement in the classified: Wife Wanted."
The next day he received a hundred letters.  They all said the same thing:
"You can have mine."
--------------------------------------
Women will never be equal to men until they can walk down the street with a
baldhead and a beer gut, and still think they are beautiful.

This spreadsheet should have everything for west power (Portland and San Fran) and for all people in Portland.  I have prepared it in a way so that it can be easily sorted.  Chris and I have reviewed and think that it is complete.

Jeanie, could you please ensure that the following people are on a netco list somewhere:
Dan Dietrich
Steve Walton
Murray O'Neil
Terry Donovan
Dale Furrow

Also, I think that Jeff Dasovich is slated to stay in San Fran to support the west gas desk.  I don't know if anyone has considered retention for him.

Finally, I put numbers down for the IT Development people in Portland.  I have no idea if those numbers are good or not.  Please run them by Steve Nat or compare them to someone in a similar role to see if they make sense.

PS - The outside e-mail address is my home e-mail so that I can review if you need me to discuss later.

I received a call from WGR (Bruce Ports 303-450-8401) on Tuesday 12/18.  Seems no permits were filed for the Gomez, Oates or Pikes Peak treaters (which were not running) during the period WGR was operating the plant for us.  WGR did file title V paperwork and paid fees for the Gomez compression that was operating.  Probably no harm since the plants weren't running, but may be a technical violation.  Bruce asked me for some history of operation which I gave him verbally [i.e. Intratex (an Enron affiliate) operated for NNG prior to WGR].  One point I stressed, was that we believed the operating agreement obligated WGR to file any required environmental permits (with or without NNG reminding them) and that NNG was deliberate in not performing duties that WGR was paid to perform.

Bill, Anabelle contacted me on Friday, December 28, 2001and said that Larry Campbell's signed final evaluation could not be located.  At that time I told her Larry faxed his signed evaluation in on December 19, 2001.  I have a voice mail mesage into Anabelle to see if she located Larry's final evaluation.
I have tried to contact Larry at home by cell phone, and pager and have not been able to find him.  I am forwarding this note and if Larry's evaluation can still not be found I will try to contact him once again on Tuesday, January 2, 2002.
At present I have given this my best effort without much luck.

Here is the story...November production..we purchased $3.1 MM of gas and sold $3.9 MM.  On December 31, MGI paid us the gross amount. According to Jaime, we have no formal netting agreement nor have we ever netted in the past.  MGI assumed that once they paid the 3.9 we would pay the 3.1.  We did not.  Post-petition payment but pre-petition contract.  We do not have a master, and I assume we confirmed using GTCs; Jaime did indicate that the volumes were comprised of several deals.  He wants to know if he is going to get paid.  I did not want to comment and told him that I would pass to you and gave him your name.  Does he have a pre-petition or administrative claim?  He spoke to someone in settlements and told me that person (did not have name) indicated they could not pay him because of the bankruptcy. Jamie's number is below.

Thanks,
Tanya

Talked to Chris McComb yesterday assuming Chet was a no way deal. Sniffed
out what Chris has in mind and politely told him that I concerns about it
and he needed to go talk to his dad and bro about what they wanted to do.
Chris proposed that his individual design company buy the spot for business
use and maybe his friends could shoot a buck under it too and pay him a
little back. May work I said, but opening weekend would need to be members
only, he suggested that his friends could alternate coming on opening
weekend: which I interpreted as Chris fencing spot 8a and 8b for his friends
Toby and Bobby to pay 1k a piece. I told him that was likely unacceptable,
to discuss with family and get back to me...

I then called chet to beg one last time and he was receptive. BMC looks to
be doing better he says. He was going to talk to Molly about it and would
like to look at how co. does over the next quarter.
Please call and encourage him to commit.

Thanks ,e.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


GISB IS NOW NAESB
GISB is now officially NAESB.  (The actual pronunciation is still undetermined!!!)  I may unintentionally go back and forth between the names -- my apologies in advance.  Also, some things are still officially 'GISB', such as the operating practices.  There is still transition work to be done.  At times it's a bit confusing and has already come up during a subcommittee meeting.  I'm working to keep up with everything in NAESB, at least for a while, to watch for things that affect our quadrant and our processes.
AGA is hosting two meetings in January in Washington, D.C. to discuss the retail gas and retail electric quadrants.
Numerous meetings are being held by organizations such as NERC.  These are being held in response to the FERC order issued December 19 (RM01-12), which addresses standards development for the wholesale electric industry.  If the industry does not agree on a single standards development organization for wholesale electric standards by March 15, 2002, the FERC will either choose one or develop the standards themselves.

GISB (NAESB) UPDATE MEETINGS
Due to current events at Enron and then the holidays, I haven't held these meetings on a regular basis.  I'm working on a regular schedule of meetings.  People have said they want these to continue and prefer them to written updates.  They want to know what's going on in GISB, including what's happening with NAESB.

NOPR ON GISB VERSION 1.5 STANDARDS
I'll work with Nancy Bagot on our comments (due February 1).
The El Paso pipelines will probably comment on standard 5.3.2 (the FERC asked for comments on whether they should adopt GISB's revisions).  They will also get with INGAA to begin coordination of INGAA's comments.
I'll let you know what I hear from other pipelines or other companies.

GISB VERSION 1.5
Assuming the FERC adopts the version 1.5 standards, the implementation date for the title transfer tracking (TTT) standards is April 18, 2002.  I'll work with the pipelines to ensure we're ready.  As I recall, we've been in compliance with the proposed standards for a while.  It would be a good idea to double check.
The implementation date for the remainder of the standards could be as early as June 1, 2002.
I'm working to determine the best way to update our copy of the version 1.5 standards to incorporate the corrections noted in the errata.  It is very unlikely that GISB will correct the standards books.  Other than the pipelines, none of the EC representatives have voiced a concern or an interest in having the books corrected.  It will be difficult for our people (business and technical) to use separate documents (the standards books and the errata) when implementing.  And, it will create greater opportunities for error.

TRANSACTIONAL REPORTING
I'm working with the IR chairs to finalize the data sets.  Next, Technical will develop code values to be used on our Web sites.  The data sets will then be sent to the EC for vote (EBB implementation only at this time) and will probably be included in version 1.6, scheduled for publication on July 31, 2002.  Technical will develop the EDI implementation guides, which will be part of a later publication.

INFORMATION REQUIREMENTS
ENA has said that they will not continue to chair IR.  They may try to participate.  This leaves IR with only one chair.  Dale Davis and I are filling in the gap.  I'm not chairing any meetings -- I'm only helping outside the meetings.  We have a candidate in mind for IR chair and we're working to bring him up to speed as quickly as possible.  The current chair still is not working out, but the new chair should be able to handle the position and run IR.  The better job the IR chairs do, the less I have to do.
We are also working on a few of IR's processes.  This will help to avoid another errata situation like the one we have with version 1.5.  The more complete IR's work product is, the less the NAESB office has to handle it and, therefore, the less they can mess it up.

GISB PUBLICATION PROCESS
The task force that is working on the publication process (PPRTF) is picking up speed again (after the holidays).  This group is addressing not only the publication process, but also the approval process for standards.  We meet via conference call every Tuesday and Friday for 1/2 day.  Our work product is due to the EC in time for their February 2002 meeting.  As with IR, the results should help avoid another massive errata, as we have for version 1.5.

Another tidbit to remind us that we see/hear Divinity all around us:

Just remember, "Our God is an Awesome God!"

READ This All the Way, and send it back please!
This will give you the chills.....GOOD Chills!

A young man had been to Wed. night Bible Study. The pastor had shared
about listening to God and obeying the Lord's voice. The young man
couldn't help but wonder, Does God still speak to people?"

After service, he went out with some friends for coffee
and pie, and they discussed the message. Several different ones talked
about how God had led them in different ways.

It was about ten o'clock when the young man started driving home.
Sitting in his car, he just began to pray, "God...If you still speak to
people speak to me. I will listen. I will do my best to obey."

As he drove down the main street of his town, he had the strangest
thought to stop and buy a gallon of milk. He shook his head and said out
loud, "God is that you?"  He didn't get a reply and started on toward
home.

But again, the thought, buy a gallon of milk. The young man thought
about Samuel and how he didn't recognize the voice of God, and how
little Samuel ran to Eli. "Okay, God, in case that is you, I will buy
the milk." It didn't seem like too hard a test of obedience. He could
always use the milk. He stopped and purchased the gallon of milk and
started off toward home.

As he passed Seventh Street, he again felt the urge, "Turn down that
street." This is crazy he thought and drove on past the intersection.
Again, he felt that he should turn down Seventh Street. At the next
intersection, he turned back and headed down Seventh. Half jokingly, he
said out loud, "Okay, God, I will."

He drove several blocks, when suddenly, he felt like he should stop.
He pulled over to the curb and looked around. He was in a
semi-commercial area of town. It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst
of neighborhoods either. The businesses were closed and most of the
houses looked dark like the people were already in bed.

Again, he sensed something, "Go and give the milk to the people in the
house across the street." The young man looked at the house. It was dark
and it looked like the people were either gone or they were already
asleep. He started to open the door and then sat back in the car seat.
"Lord, this is insane. Those people are asleep and, if I wake them up,
they are going to be mad and I will look stupid."

Again, he felt like he should go and give the milk. Finally, he opened
the door.   "Okay God, if this is you, I will go to the door and I will
give them the milk. If you want me to look like a crazy person, okay. I
want to be obedient. I guess that will count for something, but, if they
don't answer right away, I am out of here.

He walked across the street and rang the bell. He could hear some noise
inside. A man's voice yelled out, "Who is it? What do you want?"   Then
the door opened before the young man could get away.    The man was
standing there in his jeans and t-shirt.  He looked like he just got out
of bed. He had a strange look on his face, and he didn't seem too happy
to have some stranger standing on his doorstep. "What is it?" The young
man thrust out the gallon of milk. "Here I brought this to you."

The man took the milk and rushed down a hallway, speaking loudly in
Spanish. Then from down the hall came a woman carrying the milk toward
the kitchen. The man was following her holding a baby. The baby was
crying. The man had tears streaming down his face. The man began
speaking and half-crying, "We were just praying. We had some big bills
this month and we ran out of money. We didn't have any milk for our
baby. I was just praying and asking God to show me how to get some
milk."

His wife in the kitchen yelled out, "I ask him to send an Angel with
some. Are you an Angel?"

The young man reached into his wallet and pulled out all the money he
had on him and put in the man's hand. He turned and walked back toward
his car and the tears were streaming down his face.   He knew that God
still answers prayers.

This is a simple test...

If you believe that God is alive and well, send this to at least ten
people and the person that sent it to you!

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise
These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.
The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen
First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Louise

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Thanks, Lamar.  The ARM coalition's attorney is drafting the comments, which should be ready for review later this morning.  The comments will deal exclusively with the rules governing the DA suspension and won't address the contracts issue--comments on Carl Wood's demand to see the contracts will come later in the week, or first thing next week.
With respect to the positions in the comments, it's a composite of the positions of many ESPs and their customers.  Appears that some ESPs in the ARM group may want to assign customers to another ESP, which is why those comments are there.  Also, some customers want to be classified as DA in perpetuity, irrespective of their contract terms--which is why renewal, or the ability to change to another ESP, will get a lot of play.  And as you know, UC is being very aggressive in our planning meetings about facility-adds.
We could file separately, but the combined push for 1) establishing liberal suspension rules and 2) keeping contracts out of the Commission's hands will come from other folks and is likely to be pretty strong.  Not sure that separate comments would get us any additional value.  Let us know what you think.
In addition, Carl Wood isn't very interested in balancing suspension rules with the need to review contracts.  He's taking a "chain saw" approach.  He claims that he wants to see the contracts in order to determine whether he can re-set the suspension date retroactive to July 1, which the rest of the Commission currently does not seem to support.  In short, he appears hell-bent on trying to get his hands on people's contracts.  At this point the industry seems pretty solidly united in its opposition to giving them to him.
We're contacting the other Commissioners to determine whether Wood is out on his own on the contract issue--our sense at this point is that he may not have any support from other commissioners.  We'll let you know as soon as we find out.
I'll forward the draft ARM comments to you and Kevin later this AM.  If you have any other quesitons, let us know.
On the cost allocation issues, that's on a slightly slower track, but in the same forum.  Edison's position is the one they proposed to us in negotiations, which we rejected--1) all customers pay for Edison's undercollection (bundled and DA alike), 2) all customers pay for stranded DWR long-term contracts (bundled and DA alike).   The advice letters regarding implementation of the DA suspension don't offer any real detail on allocation and those issues will be hard-fought over during the first part of Q1.  That's the status thus far.  We'll know more on December 12th, when the Commission will hold another hearing on how it plans to address these issues over the next 60-90 days.

Please see Harry's note below.  I asked him to review the tariff for NIMO to validate their formula.  It appears similar to the formula NIMO is using and discussed with us; however, could you please review.  (especially the 75 heating degree days).
Harry
Dave and I have spoken with contacts at NIMO and have reduced the requirement to $3.6MM by removing a couple of counterparts which will come out of the pool Dec 1st.  MDQ was validated by the desk.  The real driver seems to be the requirement and the assumption of no gas delivery for 30 days by EES at the most extreme temperature.

Zach has gone to great efforts to evaluate his situation and experience going forward and he has decided to work with the liquidation of the EBS assets.

Thank you for offering him a position and an option to join UBS, but he will officially decline the offer.

Ed and Bill:
Per Leslie reeves, we did receive a payment from LG&E Energy Marketing so the only issue remaining on them is whether the LC has been renewed.  As Ed reported, El Paso renewed their LC so there is nothing to do on that.  With respect to Enserco, I faxed the proposed new LC to ed and spoke with Don Perkins, their credit manager (303) 568-3255.  I told him that he may be receiving a call from you regarding Fortis, the Issuer.  I also told him that drawing condition #1 would have to change to take out the reference to delivery of natural gas and he agreed.  He was also going to talk to Lynn Evans, his attorney, about the procedures that need to be followed under 'Special Instructions" as I do not think that we should be sending anything to Fortis.  More to come tomorrow.


Ed:
Please e-mail me, Sara and Jeff a description of where things stand with Niagara based on their payment today as it sounds complicated and may require us to piece together all of the contracts we have with them before deciding how to proceed.  Did you have any luck confirming the status of the  Chase LC?

Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley, on his way home from work

at City Hall, came to a dead halt in traffic on the Dan

Ryan Expressway and thought to himself, "Wow, this traffic

seems worse than usual. Nothing's moving at all."



He noticed a State Trooper walking back and forth between

the lines of cars, so he rolled down his window and asked,

"Officer, I'm Mayor Richard M. Daley, what's the problem;

what's holding everything up."



The trooper replied, "It's the Reverend Jackson.  He's so

depressed about the thought of everyone knowing about his

extra-martial affair and his illegitimate child, that he

stopped his car in the middle of the Dan Ryan Expressway

and is threatening to douse himself with gasoline and set

himself on fire. He says the country and his congregation

are blaming him for his infidelity and doesn't know if he

can live with the shame and embarrassment.  The people in

the halted cars along the expressway are taking up a

collection for him."



"Oh really," replied Mayor Daley. "How much have they

collected for the Reverend Jackson so far?"



"About 300 gallons," said the trooper, "but they are still

siphoning"

I talked with Julie Smith right after lunch about ENA responding to Tennessee's South Texas Expansion.  The deadline to submit a response is this afternoon at 5:00 pm with the understanding that a binding precedent agreement with termination outs needs to be executed by tomorrow afternoon (i.e. Thursday, November 29th).
I told Julie that I thought it was best if ENEL, rather than ENA, submitted the open season response and signed Tennessee's PA.  That way ENEL's RFP response would not get snarled up with any credit concerns that Tennessee had with the Enron Corp. announcements.  I told her that we were still an on-going concern and still wanted to sell gas to the project.  She appreciated our honesty and reaffirmed that ENEL was still interested in entering into a fuel supply arrangement with ENA.
Also, I just received an announcement from Rio Bravo Pipeline that said that "due to the CFE changing the date on which the bidders must present their Bid Proposals for the Rio Bravo IV Project from December 4, 2001 to December 11, 2001" that the Rio Bravo Pipeline Open Season was also being pushed back to December 7, 2001.  So it looks like ENEL has about another week to work on their proposal.
Ruth
P.S.  I just got off the phone with Tennessee Gas Pipeline to thank them for extending the Open Season for us and give him an update on participating in the expansion.  He indicated that "another international company" had just submitted an Open Season response.  So it looks like ENEL has submitted the necessary paperwork.

All -
Starting Wednesday, we all have lots of work to do to get the new company up and running on time.  Going forward,  we need to be a proactive organization as opposed to a reactive organization.  Given that we have the best people in the organization going over, this should not be difficult to accomplish.
Let me be very clear.  Playing on the internet will not be tolerated.  There is too much that has to get done over the next two weeks.  That message needs to be communicated to everyone going to the new company.  If people feel like they do not have anything to do,  they should be reading about options or the gas business.  This is a great opportunity for people to make themselves better employees.  I have no problem changing the lists if someone steps up,  or if someone doesn't.
Below,  are a few things I need your help with over the next few days.
(i)    Budget (due Jan 2, 2002)
First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
Each of you needs to draw up a budget for your region by the end of the day Wednesday.  Use the format that we used for the Enron 2002 Budget process.  Russ and Greg.  You will be one cost center in the new organization.
John,  can you be responsible for coordinating this and compiling all budgets into one by Wednesday night?
(ii)     Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 3)                               To be forwarded to Louise
These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.
I need to detailed plans for what files we are moving,  the systems we need,  and anything that will make the move better for the business.
Kam - Can you coordinate and give me the list be Thursday evening?
(iii)   Seating Plans                                                   Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
If you have any preferences in this area let me know ASAP, so that I can make requests now.
(iv)    Due Diligence
We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.
Just so you know, there will be more people in this week.
Please let me know how I can help in getting everything done.  I look forward to a great year working with all of you.  Thanks for all of your hard work.

Hi, Sweethearts,

I want to let you know that Michael's father passed away yesterday  morning. He had been feeling bad for about a month and last week he passed out and hurt himself. At the hospital they found out that he had a bleeding ulcer that made him faint. They took had to take him off the blood thinners and they were giving him medication for the ulcer and sent him home Tuesday night. Wednesday morning he must have had a blood clot that caused a heart attack. Crystal and Jamie did cpr which started his heart again but then it stopped.

Michael is in Denver and is going to Alamo tonight for the funeral on Saturday. The kids and I aren't going since Michael has to leave for Denver and then North Dakota on Sunday and he doesn't want me trying to drive out there alone with the kids. Michael was training on Wednesday so I waited to tell him until lunch. He is blessed that two of his good friends were there and they have helped him deal with his loss (one of them is exactly Michael's age and is dying of lymphoma...he has 5 children, the youngest just 7).

Michael seems to be doing fine, although the funeral will be hard. His family will be in a financial crisis, though. Please pray with us for them that God helps them through their pain and hard decisions.

Mandi, I hope your move goes without problems.

I love you all,

Mom

16:59 10Jan2002 RSF-WRAPUP 1-Enron called Bush Cabinet officers before bankruptcy

By Arshad Mohammed
WASHINGTON, Jan 10 (Reuters) - The collapse of Enron Corp. <ENE.N> entangled the Bush administration on Thursday as the White House said two Cabinet officers were warned of its looming bankruptcy and Attorney General John Ashcroft recused himself from the criminal investigation into the company.
Trying to inoculate himself from the political fallout, President George W. Bush ordered a review headed by Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill of U.S. pension and corporate disclosure rules to avoid a repeat of the energy trading firm's collapse, in which thousands of employees lost their pension savings.
In a series of stunning disclosures that followed Wednesday's announcement of a criminal probe into Enron, the energy firm's auditor, Andersen, said its employees had destroyed documents related to the former energy giant's balance sheet.
Bush's team has close ties to Enron and its chairman, Kenneth Lay, a major Bush campaign contributor who last autumn called O'Neill and Commerce Secretary Don Evans, Bush's 2000 campaign manager, to warn them of the impending bankruptcy.
The White House said O'Neill and Evans opted to do nothing about Lay's calls, which appeared to hint at the possibility of a private bailout like the one orchestrated by the New York Federal Reserve in 1998 for hedge fund Long Term Capital Management.
A senior U.S. official, however, said that Lay "did not ask for anything" in the telephone calls.
The Justice Department on Wednesday announced it had opened a criminal investigation into the energy trading company, whose December bankruptcy threw thousands out of work, devastated investors and wiped out the pension plans of many employees when its stock price plunged.
Ashcroft removed himself from the investigation, which is expected to focus on whether the firm misled investors about its accounts, because Enron gave him political contributions for his run for a U.S. Senate in his home state of Missouri.
DOCUMENTS DESTROYED
Anderson, the Big Five accounting firm that served as the company's auditor, on Thursday said its employees had deleted documents related to its review of the company's finances and congressional sources said thousands were destroyed.
Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who has already been seeking information about contacts between the White House and Enron, questioned whether the Bush administration could have done more to help the company and its employees.
"The White House had knowledge that Enron was likely to collapse but did nothing to try to protect innocent employees and shareholders who ultimately lost their life savings," he said in a statement. "I am deeply troubled that the White House stood by and let this happen to thousands of families."
Bush, who worked in the oil industry and has known Enron's chairman since he was governor of Texas, appeared to distance himself from Lay, saying he never discussed Enron's financial difficulties with him and last met the executive last spring.
"I have never discussed with Mr. Lay the financial problems of the company," Bush said, adding that the last time he had seen Lay was last spring at a literacy fund-raising event organized by his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush.
PHONE CALLS
White House House spokesman Ari Fleischer disclosed on Thursday that Lay telephoned O'Neill and Evans last autumn saying his company might not be able to meet its obligations.
Fleischer said Lay suggested the possibility of using the case of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM), a hedge fund which benefited from a private bailout orchestrated by the New York Federal Reserve in September 1998, as model for his company.
After studying the matter and concluding that Enron's problems would not have the kind of systemic effects on the economy that were feared in LTCM's case, O'Neill and Evans decided against taking any action.
"They both agreed no action should be taken to intervene," Fleischer said, adding that Bush was not informed of the decision but believes O'Neill and Evans acted "wisely."
At his daily briefing, the spokesman fended off questions about why Bush was not informed of the decision, the propriety and timing of Enron contacting top government officials about its problems, and whether Evans and O'Neill acted properly.
"Communication is not a wrong-doing. What took place here was they received phone calls and took no action," Fleischer said. "The charge has been did the government take any action, and the answer from these two officials is no."
Treasury spokeswoman Michele Davis said Lay called O'Neill on Oct. 28 and Nov. 8  -- after Enron's key Oct. 16 disclosure that it was taking huge charges related to its partnerships, which provided the first hint of its spectacular unraveling.
Speaking to reporters after meeting with economic advisers on Thursday, Bush placed the emphasis on workers and investors who suffered as a result of Enron's troubles and ordered two reviews to recommend how to better protect them in the future.
He said the first review, by the Treasury, Commerce and Labor departments, would analyze pension and 401(k) rules and recommend ways to reform them so that "people are not exposed to losing their life savings as a result of a bankruptcy."
The review of disclosure rules would be conducted by the Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets, which includes the Treasury Department, Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve and Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
Once the world's largest energy trader, Enron slid in mere weeks last year from Wall Street stardom to the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history on Dec. 2. Its downfall, after withdrawal of a rescue takeover bid by rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N>, threw thousands out of work and hammered investors.
The episode sapped the life savings of many Enron employees who held large amounts of company stock in their 401(k) retirement plans, while top executives allegedly pocketed fat profits by selling before a plunge in Enron's share price.
"I have great concerns for ... (those) who put their life savings aside and, for whatever reason, based upon some rule or regulation, got trapped in this awful bankruptcy and have lost life savings," Bush told reporters at the White House, saying the groups would take a "good hard look" at the matter.

Liz -- I've been unable to discuss this with Doug, as he's been out of the office. I'm not even sure if he's terribly interested in this product being promulgated -- the UBSWenergy ERCOT products he will first offer are confined to specific zones.  This product definition would presumably be used to support a "Seller's  choice" ERCOT-wide product spanning the four current zones, and the Market Clearing Price ("MCP") applicable would be in that zone the Seller specified day-ahead. (That is, there are several moving parts to this.) The denomination 'Hourly Firm' was also a matter I wished to explore with him.  Attached is a markup with my thoughts on the draft product, and this morning I'm going to talk to some other folks who might have a read on the operation of the MCP in relation to the LDs calcualtion.  Please note that if one specifies that the MCP is the cap on the Replacement Price, then a presumption is being made that no additional costs are being incurred in purchasing substitute product.  I think this is an acceptable assumption but Doug may think different.   The corrections on the attachment include some intended merely to use the defined terms actually stated in the Protocols.  The changes in the second paragraph are intended to reverse any implication that the settlement on LDs would be held open a month or even 6 months until a final MCP value is identified by ERCOT -- I'd confine the window for recalculation to one month. --DP

Little David comes home from first grade and tells his father that they
learned about the history of Valentine's Day.  "Since Valentine's day is
for a Christian saint and we're Jewish," he asks, "will God get mad at
me for giving someone a valentine?"

David's father thinks a bit, then says "No, I don't think God would get
mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?"
"Osama Bin Laden," David says.
"Why Osama Bin Laden," his father asks in shock.

"Well," David says, "I thought that if a little American Jewish boy
could have enough love to give
Osama a valentine, he might start to think that maybe we're not all bad,
and maybe start loving people a little bit.  And if other kids saw what
I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a lot.  And then
he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved
them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore."

His father's heart swells and he looks at his boy with newfound pride.
"David, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard."
"I know," David says, "and once that gets him out in the open, the
Marines could blow the shit out of him."

My name is Tim Belden and I manage the West Power trading desk in Portland.  Louise Kitchen suggested that I get in touch with you.

I spoke to Marcus Beurgler on Tuesday about the Portland office.  I indicated to him our desire to move.  We discussed an interim period in this office until we can move elsewhere.  I learned yesterday that Enron has accepted the lease on this office space.  I was not aware that this was happening and am told that we are now stuck here for the term of the lease which is three to five years.

Based on very preliminary assessment it looks like it may be cost effective to move from here.  We currently occupy 20,000 square feet when we only need roughly 10,000.  If we remain in this building there is a significant cost associated with physically separating our phones and computers from Portland General Electric.  Everyone here would like to move.

What I need to know is the following:
Is UBS Warburg obligated at this point in time to take on the lease for our current space?  If yes, can this be undone?  If no, when will this decision be made?
If we are obligated to take this space, who do I need to talk to within UBS about negotiating with Portland General Electric to get out of the lease.  I have very good relationships with Portland General Electric so I think that they would work with us on this.

I can be reached at 503-464-3820 or 503-701-7278.

Thanks,
Tim Belden

: New Date Rape Drug - Beware


DATE RAPE DRUG TARGETS MALES

(URP) - Police warn all male clubbers, party-goers, and unsuspecting pub
regulars to be alert and stay cautious when offered a drink from any woman.

A new date rape drug on the market, called "beer," is used by females to
target unsuspecting men.

The drug is generally found in liquid form, and is now available almost anywhere.
"Beer" is used by female sexual predators at parties and bars to persuade their
male victims to go home and have sex with them.
Typically, a woman needs only to persuade a guy to consume a few units of
"beer" and then simply ask him home for no-strings-attached sex.
Men are rendered helpless against this approach. After several "beers"
men will often succumb to desires to perform sexual acts on horrific looking
women to whom they would never normally be attracted.

After drinking "beer," men often awaken with only hazy memories of
exactly what happened to them the night before, often with just a vague
feeling that something bad occurred. At other times these unfortunate men
are swindled out of their life's savings in a familiar scam known as "a
relationship."

Apparently men are much more susceptible to this scam after "beer" is
administered and sex is offered by the predatory female.

Please! Forward this warning to every male you know.  However, if you fall
victim to this insidious "beer" and the predatory women administering it,
there are male support groups with venues in every town where you can
discuss the details of your shocking encounter in an open and frank manner
with similarly affected, like-minded guys.  For the support group nearest you,
just look up "Golf Courses" in the yellow pages.

This amused me this morning!

Once upon a time there was a shepherd looking after his sheep on the edge of a
deserted road. Suddenly a brand new Porsche screeches to a halt. The driver, a
man dressed in an Armani suit, Cerutti shoes, Ray-Ban sunglasses, TAG-Heuer
wrist-watch, and a Pierre Cardin tie gets out and asks the shepherd, "If I can
tell you how many sheep you have, will you give me one of them?"

The shepherd looks at the young man, then looks at the large flock of grazing
sheep and replies, "Okay."

The young man parks the car, connects his laptop to the mobile-fax, enters a
NASA Webster, scans the ground using his GPS, opens a database and 60 Excel
tables filled with logarithms and pivot tables, then prints out a 150-page
report on his high-tech mini-printer. He turns to the shepherd and says,

"You have exactly 1,586 sheep here."

The shepherd answers,

"That's correct, you can have your sheep."

The young man takes an animal and puts it in the back of his Porsche. The
shepherd looks at him and asks,

"If I guess your profession, will you return my animal to me?" The young man
answers, "Yes, why not?"

The shepherd says, "You are an IT consultant."

"How did you know?" asks the young man.

"Very simple," answers the shepherd.

"First, you came here without being called. Second, you charged me a fee to tell
me something I already knew, and third, you don't understand anything about my
friggin' business. Now can I have my dog back?"

Subject: Pfthhhhhhhh Football



An old man and his wife have gone to bed. After laying there a few minutes
the old man farts and says, "Seven Points."

His wife rolls over and says, "What in the world was that?"

The old man replied, "It's fart football."

A few minutes later the wife lets one go and says, "Touchdown, tie score."

After about five minutes the old man farts again and says, "Touchdown, I'm
ahead 14 to 7."

Not to be out done the wife rips another one and says, "Touchdown, tie
score."

Five seconds go by and she lets out a squeaker and says, "Field goal, I lead
17 to 14."

Now the pressure's on and the old man refuses to get beat by his wife so he
strains real hard but to no avail. Realizing a defeat is totally
unacceptable, he gives it everything he has, but instead of farting, he poops
the bed.

The wife looks at him and says, "What the hell was that?"

And the old man replied, "Half-time, Switch sides."

California:

CPUC - Gov. Gray Davis has appointed Michael Peevey, former President of Southern California Edison as Commissioner at the CPUC to replace Com. Bilas who resigned last week.  Gov. Davis' appointment of Mr. Peevey was met with protests from consumer groups who see him as someone advocating deregulation and having a record of pushing for higher rates for small businesses and residential consumers.  Mr. Peevey's appointment is subject to Senate approval.

I99-07-003  SoCal Unbundling.  Reviewed the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, Lorenz testimony in the System Adequacy proceeding and the Dec. 11th Unbundling Decision as to the treatment of receipt point capacity especially as related to the 50MM/d increase at Needles.  As discussed, the Lorenz testimony provides the best basis for allocating the 50MM/d to TW until the CSA provisions are implemented on Nov. 1, 2002.

A01-10-011  PG&E Gas Accord II.  The ALJ in this case, John Wong, issued a ruling on which issues will be addressed and an initial schedule for the proceeding.  Issues to be addressed include:  Determining restriction requirements on bidders of relinquished and expansion capacity; How to handle relinquished  storage capacity (i.e. open season); How contracts will be handled to match up with PG&E's proposed GTrans' capacity in its POR; and open season procedures for relinquished and expansion capacity.  Direct testimony is due July 15, 2002 and Evidentary Hearings are set to begin August 5, 2002.

A01-09-024  SoCalGas BCAP.  On Monday, SoCal filed an amended BCAP filing to reflect the impact of unbundling the system.  Copies have been requested but not yet received for review.

Election Results -  In an upset, LA businessman Bill Simon won the Republican nomination by winning 49% of the vote compared to 30% of the voters favoring former LA Mayor Richard Riordan and 17% of the vote which went to Secretary of State, Bill Jones.  Simon will run against Gov. Davis in the fall elections for Governor.  Congressman Gary Condit was beaten by his former aide, Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza.

New Mexico:

Legislative - As promised, Republican Gov. Gary Johnson vetoed this week the Legislatures latest budget proposal and vowed to keep the state running by using the previous year budget.  Democratic leaders of the Senate and House have proposed appointing a bipartisan group of lawmakers to explore whether a budget compromise can be reached with Gov. Johnson.  Johnson's Chief of Staff, David McCumber didn't reject the idea for the governor, but did raise some concerns about the approach.

Utility Case No. 3619 - The New Mexico PRC has issued proposed revisions to Rule 572 for Renewable Energy.  The Proposed revisions require all providers of electricity to increase their renewable energy portfolio such that they meet certain standards of renewable sources.   By Sept. 1, 2003 the portfolio standard will be 2%, by Sept. 1, 2005 it must be 5% and by Sept. 1 2007 renewable sources must be 10% of their energy portfolio.  Renewable sources are defined to include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal and biomass.

We can follow up with a letter suggesting that we believe their termination is wrongful, unless Mark disagrees.
Second issue is whether we should attempt to pay for the gas anyway, since they have to deliver gas paid for prior to termination.

I just received a call from Joe Krajewski (617-723-5512 x4731) at Boston Gas.  He is a Resource Management Analyst at Boston Gas working for Liz Danehy.  According to Joe, ENA is still billing Boston Gas for part of the demand charges on the long term producer netback deal (that Ruth is so familiar with).  This is Iroquois and Tennessee capacity I am releasing back to Boston Gas each month at a 100% demand rate.
Joe asked me why we were doing this and I told him that ENA was probably not paying the capacity bills and Boston Gas was aware of that fact and knew Boston Gas would be liable for the demand charges anyway.  Sounds like Boston Gas may be getting double billed and Joe said they will probably not pay the invoice.

The contract is a bit complicated.  I will prepare a contract summary along the lines of what Pete prepared for MCV.

Tom & Mike,
To make this easier,  I spoke with Dave Steiner, (Local Portland IT infrastructure) today and told him that their should be 3 ID's established,  One for trading, one for Scheduling and one for Real Time  these ID would be able to access the estate and would not be user specific but would be role specific. This way anyone on the UBS team could use them and each person does not need their own ID.
If you wish to change this please make sure that Dave Steiner is notified.
Thanks - MO

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


LOS ANGELES--Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan once again found
himself in legal trouble Monday, when he and several members of his
extensive entourage were arrested for allegedly destroying a penthouse
suite at the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Hotel officials say Greenspan, in town to address an annual
convention of Federal Reserve District Bank presidents, caused an estimated
$8,500 in damages to the room, the surrounding hallway and the
swimming-pool area.

Said Beverly Hills Hotel manager Giles Laurent: "The television
screen and cabinet had apparently been kicked in. Two chairs were thrown
out the window. The mattress was ripped and its stuffing was flung all over
the room, as well as into the hallway." Laurent added that minutes before
police arrived, Greenspan, with the help of Deputy Treasury Secretary
Kenneth
Dam, pushed a vending machine off the balcony overlooking the hotel's
swimming
pool.

During his two-day stay at the posh hotel, Greenspan also accumulated
a $781.55 room-service bill, which he has refused to pay until June 1,
when he says interest rates on German 10-year Euro-Bunds will rise to a
more favorable 5.5 percent.

Witnesses to Greenspan's behavior during the days leading up to
Monday's arrest said the 75-year-old head of the Federal Open Market
Committee was in an unusually volatile mood.

"Upon arriving Friday, Mr. Greenspan demanded that four large bowls
of M&Ms be delivered to his room, with all the orange ones removed,"
Beverly Hills Hotel concierge Alexander Poole said. "Then, when he got to
his room and saw the bowls, he flew into a rage, knocking over lamps and
screaming that he wanted the green M&Ms taken out, not the orange ones."

Greenspan got into more trouble Saturday night, when he, Fed
Vice-Chair William J. McDonough and several other members of his inner
circle
visited a trendy L.A. night spot. Clubgoers reported seeing Greenspan, still
high
off the dollar's rally against the yen last week, shout obscenities and
throw ashtrays
at the club's DJ. When security personnel attempted to restrain him,
Greenspan became
belligerent, yelling, "I'm Alan F***ing Greenspan," and vowing to put
bouncer Frank Rizzo in a "hurt bracket." The incident is already being
compared to his infamous July 1997 fistfight with John Kenneth Galbraith at
New York's China Club.

with the law.

According to Federal Reserve Board insiders, Greenspan, buoyed by the
U.S. economy's recent turn-around has grown increasingly megalomaniacal
in recent months.

"He'll spend hours talking about how he's the greatest economist who
ever lived, how he's 'bigger than Keynes,'" said one member of the Fed
Board of Governors who wished to remain anonymous. "Every time he talks
about single-handedly saving America from potential economic ruin following
the Sept. 11th tragedy by manipulating interest rates, his bloated ego just
swells
even more. It's just the sort of irrational exuberance he himself once
warned against."

Monday's arrest is only the latest in a long string of legal troubles
for the controversial Greenspan, who has had 22 court dates since becoming
Fed chief in 1987. Economists recall his drunken 1994 appearance on CNN's
Moneyline, during which he unleashed a profanity-laden tirade against
Bureau of Engraving & Printing director Larry Rolufs and punched host Lou
Dobbs when he challenged Greenspan's reluctance to lower interest rates. In
November 1993, he was arrested after running shirtless through D.C.
traffic while waving a gun. And some world-market watchers believe the
international gold standard has still not recovered from a May 1998
incident in which he allegedly exposed his genitals on the floor of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange.

Greenspan's latest quandary now involves women and minorities.  When
asked
about U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill's speech at the Women
Entrepreneurs
Conference on March 19th, Greenspan was overheard saying "What a waste of
Paul's
time.  Women and business don't go together.  Just look at what Elaine
[Chao, U.S.
Secretary of Labor] has done for our labor markets.  She's just making my
life hell.
She's the perfect example of why affirmative action doesn't work."

How much longer can Greenspan last in his position?  Only time will tell.
But, he's
looking more and more like a ticking time bomb.

I talked to Craig Taylor last week.  He doesn't know anything about the deal.  Neither does Vickie Versen.  Neither does Clarissa Garcia Hanks.  Scott Neal is probably at a UBS mtg at the Houstonian today so I cannot specifically ask him.  Considering that Citizen's high burn this month was about 80 dth/day I suspect this deal didn't even make Scott's radar screen.

I will spare you the gross details of him using a needle to dig this rusty piece of metal out of my eye like a splinter...  It was numb and still hurt.  I won't be in this afternoon.

Below is a summary of events over the last couple of days.  I hope we don't need.


Events of June 3

Gas service to the plant has been challenging.  Lonestar Pipeline is running a pig for June 4,5,&6.  Lonestar told us that roughly 60% would be cut. Apparently Friday, May 31, Kevin communicated to his scheduling counterparties the maintenance information.  He also indicated that our Lonestar	rep said the only safe scheduling points for the gas to come into their system was Lonestar-Carthage and Lonestar-Katy Plant.  Neither of the plant's suppliers -Apache/Cinergy or Williams provided gas at those points for gas day June 4.   Cuts did occur as we were warned.  Of the total nomination of 45MM, 17.1 MM flowed for today's gas flow.  The supplier breakout is Apache/Cinergy -20MM and  Williams-25MM.   Yesterday, Jeff Smiron at Lonestar said they would allow the plant to pull from their imbalance account for today's flow but they we had to have flowing gas for June 5 & 6.

I communicated the situation to Mike Mazowita at White Pines on June 3.  I also inquired about alternative fuel capability as a back-up.  The plant can burn No.6 low sulfur fuel oil.  Mike indicated that the plant would not want to do that and hadn't burned oil in quite some time.  I told Mike that I would use the possibility of alternative fuel replacement costs as leverage with the suppliers.  He inquired if I knew how Lonestar would cut back the plant.  I told him that I 	wasn't familiar with Lonestar specifically but based on my experiences in gas control from a previous life that for a plant of it's size they probably have remote control capabilities.  If not they would sent a field worker out to the meter station to adjust the valve.

The Apache and Williams supply contracts mirror each other in language.  The way I interrupt the contract language is that the supplier has the right to choose the supply point/points into Lonestar's system from a list of primary or secondary points in Exhibit A.  If the plant's transportation contract gets interrupted then the supplier has the obligation to deliver gas into Lonestar's system at a location that will flow on the plant's transportation agreement.  If the supplier shorts theplant then the supplier is obligated to pay for replacement costs for either gas or alternate fuels.  Yesterday, I communicated my interpretation of the agreements to Frank Fields at Williams and to Michelle Morgan and her boss Tom Strickland at Cinergy.  Tom indicated that there had been an amendment and I told him I didn't have a copy of the amendment.   Sounds like the amendment may have changed some of the delivery points.  I told Tom at Cinergy that 	my primary concern was flowing gas supply to the plant.  Tom was suggesting that this may be a force majuere event.  I told him I didn't interpret	the force majuere language that way.  The force majuere language addresses freeze-offs and line breaks but not maintenance.  I also told him that the contract has a provision for transportation interruption.

In any case I told Tom time was of the essence and I was focusing on the operational issues and not monetary issues.  I told him we could address the 	financial resolution per the contract after the event was over.  I told him that the financial resolution of replacement gas for three days was minimal in comparison to any potential damages incurred by the plant due to the pipe cutting back their gas supply.


Events of June 4

This morning I spoke with Michelle Morgan at Cinergy.  They are supplying 12.9MM at Aquila-Katy into Lonestar for June 5.  Williams is buying 10MM at Carthage and 5MM at HLPL for June 5.  Per Lonestar this should be OK for June 5.  Michelle had said she would pay back the shorted volume from June 4 after the pigging was completed.  They will  pay back the volume ratably for the remainder or in a day.

Russ Brown at Lonestar contacted Kevin around 12:30 to say the plant needed to cut back to the 17.1MM flowing gas volume for today.  The plant's burn rate was causing the pig to run to fast.  Russ is the manager of the transportation administration department at Lonestar.  I called Russ back at 1:10pm to inquire about the problem.  I asked him to call gas control and see when the pig run would be over and to see if there was a point that we could bring gas in intraday to help alleviate the problem.   I also called Mike to inform him of the new events.  Russ called back and said the run would be over at 12:00pm tonight and that the only interconnect location that could help was El Paso Field Services-Ennis.  He also indicated that the pressure had stabilized and the plant may be able
to make it through the run without the incremental gas.  I called Cinergy and Williams to see if they could make gas available intraday at the point.  Frank at Williams said they could not and Michelle at Cinergy said she would let me know.  At 3:30 Michelle indicated that they could buy the gas and the cost would be $0.95 to $1.00 more than the contract price.  She said that they didn't think Apache was liable for the costs because the requested meter is not on the delivery point lists in the contract.  They would buy the gas if we would agree to pay the price.  I called Mike at White Pines and ask him what he wanted to do.  He indicated that he wanted us me to buy the gas.  I called Russ to get an update and see if we could still do the nom.  Russ said the plant was burning more.  Now they were burning 48MM and requested they cut back to their nominated volume of 45MM.  I told Russ I didn't think that they could be I would call.  Mike confirmed that they could not.  He said had already called Brazos to see if they could back off even 20 to 30 MW.  He said Brazos is "playing chicken" and are requesting everything they have.   I told him I would call Cinergy and see if I could get them to nominate the gas and agreed to settle the financial side per the contract after the pigging event is completed.  I called Michelle with my proposal and she said she needed to talk to Apache and would call me back.  We agreed to nominate the intraday gas and work out the financial part after the event was over.  Michelle called back and said the gas was going to come from storage and due to pressure problems the gas could not be delivered.

Events of June 5

The plant made it through the June 4 gas day on gas.  I spoke with Michelle and she indicated that they were planning on serving gas day June 6 the same as June 5.  She said that Apache didn't think they were liable to make up the gas they shorted us for June 4.  She said I could talk with Pat Green at Apache regarding the issue.  Williams moved their gas from Carthage to HPL for June 6.  I left a message for Russ at Lonestar to check on the point.  I requested that 	Kevin do the same with his Lonestar contact.  Neither of us has had a return call from our corresponding Lonestar counterparties.  We will have to address the 	issue intraday if necessary.

I will keep everyone posted of any new developments.

I will be passing out an updated list with the cross references so that you can quickly identify which curves now have Truequote in them.  These curves are now available so that you can begin shaping and revising them.  As you complete the curves, please remember to update the status report so that PWC can begin taking a look at the completed work.  The progress report has been modified to include a field for quotes entered as well as when the revisions are completed by each trader.

Also,  Tim has listed below the contact and phone number of the Truequote representative if you would like to contact him to see if you can more easily match up the remaining Truequote curves with the Enron curves.

Thanks for you help!

Chris,

I got a call this morning from Bill Geist from Tenaska Marketing Ventures.  He is interested in ENA's agency, transport, storage and fuel management agreements.  I told him that we may be looking for a buyer of our Bridgeline inventory.  He was interested.  Call him at 402-758-6195.  He may also be interested in picking up the contracts also.

In the past the following folks have also expressed an interest in storage/inventory in the Gulf Coast.  The numbers are on our contact list.

Cook Inlet
Cinergy
CMS Energy Trading
Dominion
Marathon
Oneok
Sempra
Western Gas Resources
TXU

Be sure to ask them if there is any interest in picking up the storage contract and firm transport agreements.  I would tell them that both are discounted from the maximum tariff rates.

Two couples were playing cards one evening. John accidentally dropped  some cards on the floor. When he bent down under the table to pick them up, he noticed that Bill's wife's legs were wide apart, and she  wasn't wearing any underwear!

Shocked by this, John upon trying to sit back up again, hit his head on the table & emerged red-faced. Later, John went to the kitchen to get some refreshments. Bill's wife followed & asked, "Did you see anything that you liked under there?"

Surprised by her boldness, John admitted that, well, indeed he did.   She said, "Well, you can have it but it will cost you $500."  After taking a minute or two to assess the financial situation as well as the moral costs of this offer, John says that he is indeed interested.  She tells him that since her husband, Bill, works Friday afternoons & John doesn't, that John should be at her house around 2pm Friday afternoon.
When Friday rolled around, John showed up at Bill's house for the planned time at 2pm sharp & after paying her the agreed upon $500, they went to the bedroom & completed their sexual transaction as Sue had promised. Afterwards, John quickly dressed & left.
As usual, Bill came home from work at 6pm & upon entering the house, asks his wife abruptly, "Did John come by the house this afternoon?"

With a lump in her throat, Bill's wife answered, "Why yes, he did stop by for a few minutes this afternoon". Her heart nearly skipped  a beat when her husband curtly asked, "And did he give you $500?". In terror, she assumed that somehow he had found out, & after mustering up her best poker face, replied, "Well, yes, in fact he did give me $500".

Bill, with a satisfied look on his face, surprised his wife by saying,"Good, I was hoping he did. John came by the office this morning &
borrowed $500 from me. He promised me he'd stop by our house this afternoon on his way home & pay me back."

NOW THAT'S A PLAYER! ! ! !

WSJ(1/14)Heard On The Street:Enron Ex-CEO Made Bet Vs. Rival

01/13/2002
Dow Jones News Services
(Copyright  2002 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)


By Ken Brown
Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal

When Jeffrey Skilling resigned as chief executive of Enron Corp. in mid-August, he said he wanted to spend more time with his three children. "I've missed too many soccer games over the years," he told his brother Tom soon after he quit.

But instead of standing on the sidelines, Mr. Skilling stayed in the game, making a big, speculative stock-market bet against an Enron rival.

A spokeswoman for Mr. Skilling confirms that he made the wager: a short sale initiated on Aug. 24 against shares of AES Corp., a big energy producer. A person familiar with the matter puts the trade's value at $30 million, though Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the estimate is "way out of the ballpark" on the high side.

The bet came as AES's shares were tumbling, and, depending on when it was closed out, could have netted him a profit of more than $15 million. Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman, Judy Leone, confirms he did make a profit on the trade but won't say how much or when the trade was closed out. "There is a category of personal financial information that we're going to respect Mr. Skilling's privacy on," Ms. Leone says.

As CEO of Enron, which made most of its money trading in the volatile energy markets, Mr. Skilling was used to taking on risk. He pushed the company into several unproven businesses, including the trading of bandwidth, or network capacity, a market that ultimately didn't prove successful for the Houston company. Enron itself reveled in a swashbuckling attitude that ultimately contributed to its downfall; the company has been under bankruptcy-court protection since early last month.

But a bet of this type was exceptionally risky. In short sales, investors borrow shares of a stock and sell them, hoping the stock will fall so they can replace the shares with cheaper ones. Such trades are riskier than buying a company's shares directly, because if the stock rises strongly, an investor with a short position on the shares can be forced to "cover" the bet at a sky-high cost.

As it turns out, AES shares, along with those of other energy companies, fell steadily in the month after Mr. Skilling's resignation. Then on Sept. 26, AES stock tanked, falling by nearly 50%, when the company announced it wouldn't meet analysts' earnings estimates for 2001. If Mr. Skilling had maintained his short bet through that date, he could have earned better than 60% on his investment.

AES, based in Arlington, Va., blamed the earnings shortfall in part on the fall in the Brazilian currency. AES wouldn't comment on Mr. Skilling's trading. "Commenting on another company's now-departed executive's behavior is not a comment I think we ought to make," says Kenneth Woodcock, a company spokesman.

Mr. Skilling's bet raises the question about whether he knew anything special about AES's business because of his work at Enron. Ms. Leone, his spokeswoman, says Mr. Skilling shorted the AES shares based on a July 30 page-one article in The Wall Street Journal that said AES was having trouble in its big Brazilian operations and would be hurt by the fall in the Brazilian currency. Based on information in the article and his general knowledge about how business in Brazil worked, he felt that the company's stock might fall in price. His trading decision was "absolutely not" based on any nonpublic information he had obtained while an Enron executive, she says.

AES did trade energy with Enron, but only a small amount and only as a way to sell its output, rather than to earn a profit, according to Mr. Woodcock. He adds that there would be no obvious way for Mr. Skilling to have gained any unique or valuable knowledge about AES through Enron's dealings with his company.

The trade was made through Mr. Skilling's account at Charles Schwab & Co., the big discount broker, and it created a buzz inside the firm's San Francisco offices. After the position was taken, "we checked up on it a couple of days later, and a couple of days after that, and said, oh, it went down," says the person familiar with the trade.

At the time of Mr. Skilling's resignation, Schwab executives in their newly opened private-client office in Houston were trying to sell Mr. Skilling on a plan to hedge the value of his Enron stock, the person says. Schwab executives in San Francisco had created an elaborate presentation for the hedging strategy, called a collar, but Mr. Skilling never acted on it, a decision that may have cost him millions, the person says. Mr. Skilling wouldn't comment on the collar proposal.

At the time of his resignation on Aug. 14, the 1.1 million Enron shares that Mr. Skilling owned outright were worth about $47 million. He also had 500,000 vested options that were in the money, meaning their exercise price was below the stock's share price at the time. Mr. Skilling has said he sold about 500,000 of the shares he owned outright on Sept. 17, when the stock market reopened following the terrorist attacks. That sale would have netted him about $15 million, based on that day's volatile prices.

His remaining 600,000 shares are worth $408,000 at Enron's current share price of 68 cents, and his options are worthless. Just accounting for the 600,000 shares he owns outright, the collar proposed by Schwab could have saved Mr. Skilling more than $30 million.

Interestingly, professional investors often will try to hedge a big positive bet on a company in any given industry by shorting shares of a rival, on the theory that if the entire industry tumbles, the gains on the short sale would offset the losses on the long position. But Mr. Skilling's spokeswoman says the trade wasn't a hedge, adding that it was the "first and only time" he made a short sale and that right now the only stock Mr. Skilling owns is Enron. "If he thought the stock price was going down he could have sold all his Enron shares; he didn't," Ms. Leone says.

Enron and Schwab, which were often paired in magazine articles touting America's most innovative companies, had at least one minor business relationship. Schwab had handled a small portion of Enron's 401(k) called the "brokerage window," which allowed employees to buy mutual funds not offered in the company's plan, as well as individual stocks for their 401(k)s. The relationship ended in July when Enron made some administrative changes to the plan and Schwab was replaced.

Mr. Skilling isn't the only member of his family to suffer because of Enron's collapse. His brother Tom a Chicago television weatherman, bought 750 shares of Enron at $49 early last year "because of these incredible analyst reviews" of the company. He says he sold them in the fall at $27 to buy some land. "Little did I know if I stuck with it I would have a 60-cent stock," he says in an interview from his vacation home in Alaska.

He says his father suffered more: He bought 2,000 shares of Enron last year and still holds them. "You wonder what in God's name were the analysts doing," Tom Skilling says. "There were a lot of people lulled into, I don't know what, a comatose state."

I received Oxy's gisb contract this afternoon and have forwarded it on to legal for review and comments.  I ask for a notional quote this afternoon.  My contact had told me he would have a notional quote this afternoon.  However, he has been in meetings since 2:00.  I will call back tomorrow.  They have inquired if they could by the gas in the ground and manage the transportation agreement so they would have the daily flexibility.  I told them I didn't think that was possible but I would check.  I also told him that we could possibly offer some daily flexibility with a daily deadline.

One day, three men were hiking and unexpectedly came upon a large raging, violent river. They needed to get to the other side, but had no idea of how to do so. The first man prayed to God, saying, "Please God, give me the strength to cross this river." Poof! God gave him big arms and strong legs, and he was able to swim across the river in about two hours, after almost drowning a couple of times.

Seeing this, the second man prayed to God, saying, "Please God, give me the strength ..and the tools to cross this river." Poof! God gave him a rowboat and he was able to row across the river in about an hour, after almost capsizing the boat a couple of times.

The third man had seen how this worked out for the other two, so he also prayed to God saying, "Please God, give me the strength and the tools...and the intelligence ... to cross this river." And poof! God turned him into a woman. She looked at the map, hiked upstream a couple of hundred yards, then walked across the bridge.

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


Attached at the bottom of this email is the Staff powerpoint presentation
on their recommendation to the Commission on El Paso's Full Requirements
service (FR).  The Staff Recommendation is not yet available.

Summary

As noted in yesterday's email, Staff is recommending the following general
principles:
-  The Commission convert El Paso's Full Requirements service (FR) to
Contract Demand service (CD)
- Allocation of CD be based on the greater of (1) a shipper's billing
determinants from the 1996 settlement, or (2) coincidental peak (a
shipper's own usage) based on demand on Sept. 12, 2001
- The Commission assign specific receipt point rights to shippers based on
El Paso's proposed 20 pooling point configuration
- A technical conference be convened, that may include attendance by the
Commissioners, on the Staff recommendations

Background

Staff recounted the issue on El Paso's system, including the question to be
decided by the Commission: has El Paso's FR service become unjust and
unreasonable?  Staff believes it has, and explains that it is within the
Commission's jurisdiction to allocate El Paso's capacity in order to:
(1) restore system flexibility
(2) end uncertainty (in the form of pro rata capacity cuts) of firm
delivery
(3) ensure full & fair utilization of El Paso's system

According to Staff's presentation, the problems on El Paso's system are due
to changes in system load since the pipeline's 1996 settlement.  A major
increase in CD load and the sale of all unsubscribed capacity since 1996
(which was nearly one half unsold at that time) has changed the operations
and capacity availability on El Paso, resulting in frequent capacity
constraints on the system.  This problem is aggravated by the settlement's
resultant rate freeze, which impedes any economic incentive for El Paso to
expand or upgrade its system.

Recommendations (Bob Petrocelli presenting)

Staff recommends that the Commission convert FR to CD, while maintaining
(1) the existing rate structure from the 1996 settlement, and 2) a small
amount of FT-2 FR contracts (for small customers, such as municipalities),
with an overall cap on the rate schedule.  This will "balance the interests
of all shippers and restore firm service on the El Paso system."  Also, it
will send the proper price signals for system expansions.

In comments on this and related proceedings, shippers have recommended four
allocation methods for the converted CD:
(1) 1996 settlement bid determinants
(2) system peak (coincidental demand)
(3) individual peak (non-coincidental demand)
(4) some combo of the above

Staff recommends utilizing the greater of #1 or #2 (using Sept. 12, 2001,
as benchmark demand day).  This reflects current usage mitigated by the
settlement capacity contracts.

Staff also recommends the Commission assign specific receipt point rights,
using El Paso's proposed expanded 20 pool system [in this proposal, El Paso
narrows its current six pools in three basin areas to 20 geographic pools].
As support of this recommendation, Staff noted:
(1) it is consistent with the Commission's one-time delivery point
allocation in BR/Amoco/Topock complaint case
(2) gives certainty for supply to all shippers
(3) enhances the tradeability of capacity
(4) eliminates daily pro rata curtailments in the basin

Commissioners' Discussion

Pat Wood:  He noted that 10-year settlements are far too prospective and
will never be approved by him.  Whether the Staff recommendation is the
best fix is the question that will be explored in the technical conference.
Chairman Wood also asked how the economic incentive to expand will be
different -- Staff answered that in 1995 the settlement's intent was to
keep the system viable at all, and changes are needed to move to next step.
Wood also noted that "this wouldn't have happened if El Paso had complied
with Order 636 -- it's a lesson on the power side that we not carve out
exceptions."

Nora Brownell:  Brownell asked questions about the current infrastructure,
how the takeaway capacity at Topock is being handled, and if this addresses
future capacity needs.  Staff responded that this is "an economic fix to
the current disincentives for El Paso expansions," and that there are
proposals out there to address future capacity and takeaway needs.

Bill Massey: Stated that the current situation is "intolerable" and that
Staff's presentation persuaded him that their plan is reasonable because
"bold Commission action is necessary here."

Linda Breathitt:  She asked if there are any other interstate pipelines
using FR service, and was told no, only some intrastate municipalities
still utilize FR on a commodity demand basis.

PUC Commissioner Richard A. BIlas RESIGNS
Commissioner Richard A. Bilas of the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has resigned from the PUC, effective at the close of business on March 8, 2002.
In a resignation letter to Governor Gray Davis, Commissioner Bilas said that concerns about the health of himself and his wife have made it impossible for him to adequately and effectively serve as a Commissioner.  "I am thankful for having been able to work in a policy making position in California," said Commissioner Bilas.  "I hold only good memories of the experience."  Commissioner Bilas' term was set to expire on January 1, 2003.
Fellow Commissioners expressed comments on Commissioner Bilas' resignation:
"I enjoyed working with Commissioner Bilas and I wish both him and his wife well," said Loretta Lynch, President of the PUC.
"I'm sorry to hear of the Commissioner's resignation," said Commissioner Henry Duque.  "He has been a great asset to the Commission, and I will miss him."
"I am sorry to hear of Commissioner Bilas' resignation," said Commissioner Carl Wood.  "I wish him and his wife good health."
"I am sorry to see Commissioner Bilas leave," said Commissioner Geoffrey Brown.  "He was a major force on the Commission.  His intellectual critique was always brilliant and he will be greatly missed."
Commissioner Bilas was appointed to the PUC on January 1, 1997, by Governor Pete Wilson.  On February 1, 1998, he became Commission President and served in that capacity until March 2000.
A biographical sketch of Commissioner Bilas is available on the PUC's web site at: http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/static/aboutcpuc/commissioners/bilas/index.htm.

Entex is several days overdue on their Nov01 invoice payment to Enron.  I confirmed that the payment has not been received as of COB yesterday (1/23/02).

I spoke with the commercial contact, Royal Edmondson (713-207-3384) this morning.  He was aware that they have not paid and eluded to the fact that Enron has not paid Tennessee's Nov01 transportation and storage invoice, which we are agent for Entex.

I also spoke with Ken Armstrong (713-207-3365) who proposed that Entex would pay Enron the commodity portion of the invoice and pay the transportation charges directly to Tennessee.  I asked him to let me clear that with our attorney so that we didn't do anything to void the agency status.  Ken also said he would consider paying us our full invoice amount if he was convinced that their transportation invoice was paid.

Gerald, please call me ASAP so we can resolve this and receive payment.

Everybody got alot accomplished today on our firedrill.  Yeah Team!  Here's a quick update:

Maria, located the missing "DRI Operating" agreements and correspondence.  See the fax I sent to your computer.  The bad news, it is a 1 year, evergreen agreement with 60 days notice by either party prior to the end of the contract year (i.e. 60 days notice prior to October 31, 2002) to terminate.  Looks like paying them for post petition gas and reject the contract may be the best answer for the estate.  She also uncovered another listing of global contract numbers that may be the key to finding the other missing agreements in LiveLink.

Chris, has been reviewing Wade's TCO data and comparing it to pipeline gathering invoices.  I can't answer your question about whether we are making money yet, but we are getting really close to the answer.  He is getting all the data together for the sales pitch now, so that everything will go smoothly next week.  He is also attacking all the other companies that relate to the producers.

Wade & Robin & Chris are working on the Dominion producers to try to see if they can approximate the high level summary retroactive reallocation volume adjustments that Chris has prepared.  I will forward you Wade's email from Dominion that says that any additional detail is tied up in bankruptcy court.  When they get done, we will be able to approximate what the $ impact is in pushing the producers back to 12/3/02.

Your paralegal & Maria really made alot of progress on finding the contracts.  I think we are up to a 100% success ratio going forward.  They still need to go back and try to find the missing ones.  We sent you a "big gift" of contracts to your D.C. office for Monday delivery.

NY Ed begged me to make sure that the DRI letter gets out on Friday.  I told him that he was going to have to argue 120 new cases in front of the court.  Hee Hee

Our Ed is taking vacation on Friday, June 28th.  We will need to make sure everything gets done so that the letter can be signed on Thursday.

I did not get anything done on the other things we discussed yesterday.

Have a great weekend,
Ruth

Deer All:

Chris and his crew of Tobby and Bobby and Joe and I managed to do some solid
work on Saturday. In addition to standard spring shut down of stands
(closing up blinds and pulling motors off barrels) we moved some blinds
around.All should be impressed with the new stand arrangements in the half
section.

BONE YARD
The tower blind at Pig stand has been relocated to the boneyard. The stand
was placed very close to where the ground blind and tripod were originally
located. It is well hidden and the barrel and feed pen were moved back to
there original location. Standing at the feeder and looking back at the
stand, all you see is from the gun window up and that blends into an oak
motte behind the stand.

PIG STAND (new)
The ground blind was then moved from boneyard to a new location just west
and a little north of the windmill and tank in the half section. The spot is
very good, providing a look due west for several hundred yards into the
heart of the draw in the half section. You can also look south a long way
and have good view of a game trail leading to the tank.
We moved the feed pen around the corn barrel at the old pig stand and set it
up in this new location. The protein barrel stayed put and is about 500
yards to the south and west.

Mertz has reclaimed two of his barrels and two of his spincast motors (I
gave him the poorest performing motors and the two barrels without varmit
cages). As a result, we needed to pull the 30/30 barrel to locate at the new
pig stand. We took the 10 foot tripod back to the trailer. This leaves us
with 9 solid stand locations. 9 good feeders (assuming the Lehman feeder at
boneyard is working well and sweeny is working). We will need to make a
magnum conversion on the barrel at the mesquite flat for next year. IF all
motors are working we will have two green tubes for back ups. I think we
should invest in one more magnum motor as a back up. I will look for one on
sale.

Keith, the new pig stand is ready to hunt with the old box blind from
boneyard, so the construction of a new box is not necessary. HOWEVER, if you
and the boys need a summer project, a lonestar type size box would be great,
but it does not need a tower. A couple of cinder blocks or those concrete
blocks at the trailer is all the height you need. Any more and it actually
won't work. The blind location is under a big oak (like the hideout), a
tower of any height will raise the box up too high into the branches. Also,
Chris should have brought home the lehman feeder motor. the time was right,
but would not test fire. Don't know if battery was completely dead (solar
deal was hooked up) or if its motor is shot. Please check it out so we can
have confidence in that motor next year. It gave us a bad time at the
boneyard last season.

Next Fall's work weekend should be easy, if we have solid participation from
lease members. It would be a good idea to look at your calendars now. Labor
day will be out for me this year (although everyone else is welcome to
select that and run with it). How about the 14th or 28th?? Please check your
calendars and let me know what works best for you.

Fall TO DO
1)standard filling barrels, putting on motors, trimming shooting lanes and
opening up blinds (killing wasps, oiling chairs).
2)switch barrels at showtime and hole to allow hole to hold more bags of
corn. This will increase the capacity and hopefully allow it to remain full
if we have rain that prevents us from getting down there to refill the
feeder.
3)little bit more chainsaw work at boneyard to open up shooting lanes to
west towards fence and south.
4)Install new box at pig stand??? If keith and boys build one.
5)Install lock on trailer door to protect valuables (kegerator and beer)
6)Install lock on gun cabinet for child saftey.
7)Hunt doves and drink draft beer, sweat and smell bad.

Erik.

Mertz called to see how the weekend went.

He is looking for new hunters. He just kicked a guy off a 4,700 acre lease
and he had a guy go into bankrucy on a company lease on 5,400 acres. He is
going to put an add in the houston chronicle. If you guys know anyone
looking for a lease of that size, might want to call mertz for more info and
put them in touch.

He also suggested that he is still looking for a farmer to plant one field
in milo for dove hunting and one in fall vegetation for deer hunting. If he
does one in milo, he was thinking he could use it for a little dove hunting
for himself and friends. I told him we would probably not have a problem
with that arrangement in return for him getting the fields planted. I'll
believe it when I see it.

I spoke w/ Johnny Nor at Navajo today.  I told him that ENA could not wait any longer for Navajo's decision.  They have until 4PM Houston time TODAY, 3/20/02 to get a termination to ENA (via Stephanie Panus' fax: 713-646-4818).  He understands that if they do not terminate today ENA will terminate Navajo TODAY.  He gave me his fax number, 505-748-6742 (note that this is different from the fax number used for the demand letter).

Susan: Notes for the DDL.

Stephanie: Please watch the fax for a document from Navajo.

Sara: Based on the conversation w/ Nor I think we should be prepared to send a termination.  (Don't think Navajo will terminate.)  Call if you have questions.

Subject: Why did the chicken cross the road?


A new updated version.....

-----

KINDERGARTEN TEACHER: To get to the other side.

PLATO: For the greater good.

ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross roads.

KARL MARX: It was a historical inevitability.

CAPTAIN JAMES T. KIRK: To boldly go where no chicken has gone before.

DR. TIMOTHY LEARY: Because that's the only trip the establishment would let
it take.

SADDAM HUSSEIN: This was an unprovoked act of rebellion. We were justified
in dropping 50 tons of nerve gas on it.

RONALD REAGAN: I forgot.

HIPPOCRATES: Because of an excess of phlegm in its pancreas.

ANDERSEN CONSULTING: Deregulation of the chicken's side of the road was a
threatening dominant market position. The chicken was faced with
significant challenges to create and develop the competencies required for
the newly competitive market.  Andersen Consulting, in a partnering
relationship with the client, helped the chicken by rethinking its physical
distribution strategy and implementation processes. Using the Poultry
Integration Model(PIM),
Andersen helped the chicken use its skills, methodologies, knowledge,
capital and experiences to align the chicken's people, processes and
technology in support of its overall strategy within a Program Management
framework.

Andersen Consulting convened a diverse cross-spectrum of road analysts and
best chickens along with Anderson consultants with deep skills in the
transportation industry to engage in a two-day itinerary of meetings in
order to leverage their personal knowledge capital, both tacit and explicit,
and to enable them to synergize with each other in order to achieve the
implicit goals of delivering and successfully architecting and implementing
an enterprise-wide value framework across the continuum of poultry
cross-median processes. The meeting was held in a park-like setting,
enabling and creating an impactful environment which was strategically
based, industry-focused, and built upon a consistent, clear and unified
market message and aligned with the chicken's mission,vision, and core
values.  This was conducive towards the creation of a total business
integration solution. In summary, Andersen Consulting helped the chicken
manage change to become more successful.

LOUIS FARRAKHAN: The road, you see, represents the black man. The chicken
crossed the black man in order to trample him and keep him down.

DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING, JR.: I envision a world where all chickens will be
free to cross roads without having their motives called into question.

MOSES: And God came down from the Heavens, and He said unto the chicken,
"Thou shalt cross the road." And the chicken crossed the road, and there
was much rejoicing.

FOX MULDER: You saw it cross the road with your own Eyes. How many more
chickens have to cross the road before you believe it?

RICHARD NIXON: The chicken did not cross the road. I repeat, the chicken did
NOT cross the road.

MACHIAVELLI: The point is that the chicken crossed the road. Who cares why?
The end of crossing the road justifies whatever motive there was.

JERRY SEINFELD: Why does anyone cross a road? I mean, why doesn't anyone
ever think to ask, "What the heck was this chicken doing walking around
all over the place, anyway?"

SIGMUND FREUD: The fact that you are at all concerned that the chicken
crossed the road reveals your underlying sexual insecurity.

BILL GATES: I will soon release the new Chicken Office 2002, which will not
only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and
balance your checkbook.

OLIVER STONE: The question is not, "Why did the chicken cross the road?
"Rather, it is, "Who was crossing the road at the same time, whom we
overlooked in our haste to observe the chicken crossing?"

CHARLES DARWIN: Chickens, over great periods of time, have been naturally
selected and evolved over time in such a way that they are now genetically
endowed with the capabilities required to cross roads.

ALBERT EINSTEIN: Whether the chicken crossed the road or the road moved
beneath the chicken depends upon your frame of reference.

BUDDHA: Asking this question denies your own chicken nature.

RALPH WALDO EMERSON: The chicken did not cross the road. It transcended it.

COLONEL SANDERS: I missed one.

BILL CLINTON : I did not, repeat, did not have sexual relations with the
chicken.

Chris/Joe

Attached are my comments to the Batch Funding Request for Centana.

By carbon copy of this email, I am sending it to Chip and Gerald for their review and comment (Chip and Gerald should accept all changes to simplify their review given that this is their first pass at it).  Chip is up to speed on this deal (I spoke with him about this last week).  I am not sure whether Gerald knows anything about this transaction, but his skill set and knowledge base make him the ideal lawyer for this arrangement.

Gerald - I would truly appreciate it if you would look at this.  The good news on this transaction is that there is very little in the way of documentation.  Your insight would be invaluable given your Bridgeline dealings.

Thanks in advance.

Stuart

Gerald,

If you haven't heard from Joe on this, please get in touch with him.

Joe - this is a reasonable request given that we need to understand why they feel that they are entitled to hold the gas.  We are not trying to be argumentative but need to understand (and have them articulate a rationale for) why they feel that they can do this.  Once we hear where they are coming from, I think we will be able to get to where everyone wants to go (i.e. settlement and sale of the gas).

Friends & Family,  My cousin sent this to me today and I know it touched me. How would our children react to this situation?  I pray they would do the same. I pray this is what we are teaching them, love and humanity.

Subject: FW: Food For Thought

Don't look for a punch line. There isn't one. Read it anyway. My question to
all of you is: Would you have made the same choice?  At a fundraising dinner
for a school that serves learning disabled children, the father of one of
the students delivered a speech that would never be forgotten by all who
attended. After extolling the school and its dedicated staff, he offered a
question. "When not interfered with by outside influences, everything nature
does is done with perfection. Yet my son, Shay cannot learn things as other
children do. He cannot understand things as other children do Where is the
natural order of things in my son?" The audience was stilled by the query.
The father continued. "I believe, that when a child like Shay comes into the
world, an opportunity to realize true human nature presents itself, and it
comes, in the way other people treat that child." Then he told the followingstory:

Shay and his father had walked past a park where some boys Shay knew were
playing baseball. Shay asked, "Do you think they'll let me play?"  Shay's
father knew that most of the boys would not want someone like Shay on their
team, but the father also understood that if his son were allowed to play,
it would give him a much-needed sense of belonging. Shay's father approached
one of the boys on the field and asked if Shay could play. The boy looked
around for guidance and, getting none, he took matters into his own hands
and said, "We're losing by six runs and the game is in the eighth inning. I
guess he can be on our team and we'll try to put him in to bat in the ninth
inning." In the bottom of the eighth inning, Shay's team scored a few
runs but was still behind by three. In the top of the ninth inning, Shay put
on a glove and played in the outfield. Even though no hits came his way, he
was obviously ecstatic just to be! in the game and on the field, grinning
from ear to ear as his father waved to him from the stands.  In the bottom
of the ninth inning, Shay's team scored again. Now, with two outs and the
bases loaded, the potential winning run was on base and Shay was scheduled
to be next at bat. At this juncture, let Shay bat and give away their chance
to win the game?  Surprisingly, Shay was given the bat. Everyone knew that a
hit was all but
impossible cause Shay didn't even know how to hold the bat properly, much
less connect with the ball. However, as Shay stepped up to the plate, the
pitcher moved in a few steps to lob the ball in softly so Shay could at
least be able to make contact. The first pitch came and Shay swung clumsily
and missed. The pitcher again took a few steps forward to toss the ball
softly towards Shay. As the pitch came in, Shay swung at the ball and hit a
slow ground ball right back to the pitcher. The pitcher picked! up the soft
grounder and could have easily thrown the ball to the first baseman. Shay
would have been out and that would have been the end of the game. Instead,
the pitcher took the ball and turned and threw the ball on a high arc to
right field, far beyond the reach of the first baseman. Everyone started
yelling," Shay, run to first! Run to first!"  Never in his life had Shay
ever made it to first base. He scampered down the baseline, wide-eyed and
startled; Everyone yelled,
"Run to second, run to second!" By the time Shay rounded first base, the
right fielder had the ball. He could have thrown the ball to the
second-baseman for the tag, but he understood the pitcher's intentions and
intentionally threw the ball high and far over the third-baseman's head.
Shay ran toward second base as the runners ahead of him deliriously circled
the bases toward home.  Shay reached second base, the opposing shortstop ran
to him, turned h! im in the direction of third base, and
shouted, "Run to third!" As Shay rounded third, the boys from both teams
were screaming, "Shay, run home!" Shay ran to home, stepped on the plate,
and was cheered as the hero who hit the "grand slam" and won the game for
his team."That day," said the father softly with tears now rolling down his
face, "the boys from both teams helped bring a piece of true love and
humanity
into this world."

AND, NOW A LITTLE FOOTNOTE TO THIS STORY:

We all send thousands of jokes through the e-mail without a second thought,
but when it comes to sending messages about life choices, people think twice
about sharing. The crude, vulgar, and often obscene pass freely through
cyberspace, but public discussion about decency is too often suppressed in
our schools and workplaces. If you're thinking about forwarding this
message, chances are that you're probably sorting out the people on your
address list that a! ren't the "appropriate" ones to receive this type of
message. Well, the person who sent you this believes that we all can make a
difference. We all have
thousands of opportunities every single day to help realize the "natural
order of things."  So many seemingly trivial interactions between two people
present us with a choice:  Do we pass along a little spark of love and
humanity or do we pass up that opportunity, and leave the world a little bit
colder in the process?

ORIGINAL MESSAGE: 


This afternoon I called Mike Stoll at MRT to update him on Enron's progress in getting Creditor Committee approval for the permanent release of the EES and EEM transport contracts.  Mike said that after additional internal discussions, MRT had decided to file a Motion with the bankruptcy court on Monday just to make sure that they get in the queue to get a decision made.  The Motion will request that Enron be compelled to accept or reject the contracts by a specified date.  This is a change from MRT's earlier position.  It appears that MRT is following PGT (PGE-NW) strategy.

I asked whether the Motion would be filed in the morning or the afternoon.  He said he did not know.  I told him that if everything went well today with the approval process, Enron would probably be able to get the instruction letter to MRT on Monday.  He said he would pass the information to their upper management.  He did not know if this update would impact their decision of if or when MRT files.

II believe that if we can notify them that it has been approved by early on Monday, that we may be able to prevent the Motion being filed.

Any news yet?

I think you are right on there...I'm just telling you that if you had seen that 10 point I shot "on the hoof", not dead on the ground w/ a cut out lower jaw for inspection, you would have said "Damn, that's an old deer."
Compared to his Identical Offspring. Same body size, Same EXACT antler formation (9" g-2's, with a 2 inch kicker coming out sideways from his left G-2, and crab claw) The only difference b/w these 2 deer was the young one had about 2 inches more spread, and about 15 inches more total antlers) Mass was more on my deer, indicating age. The BIG difference was standing side by side, the younger one looked like a "thoroughbread Horse", while mine looked like a mule...if you can understand that. That being said, if we think that we are underestimating age on the hoof and putting all the criteria together about what "formula" makes a old deer look old, I would have to say that My 10 point was "Mature and on his way down" while the young one (Same deer that Keith has seen, too) is "Mature and on his way up". The last thing I have to say about that was that the "Young" deer of the two was definitely the "dominant" of the two as well. He was aggressive towards my "ol' bastard" and the old guy didn't want any part of him...The young one was passed on harvesting by both Keith and myself and I chose to harvest the older one of the two. Put in the same arena with a bunch of does and his younger sibling, that younger sibling was gonna get the chance to "pour the Chili" while the old guy snuck in from the brush, got bullied away by the "stud", ate enough to survive, and silently sneaked away. Meanwhile the younger stud, ate and chased does around to his hearts content, no worries about anything. Which deer needed to get shot in that scenario?
My final answer...my deer..7.5 yrs or older. His son, 4.5 and about to be a Texas Big Game Award winner next season if he lives through the summer and doesn't "disappear" like a lot of the other bucks we never see again from year to year.

No!  It will happen this Sept. when he starts doing his T-Rex cough/gag on
the bovine-bile ridden pond-water at the 500 acres.  And, it would be much
more fitting for him to do it "in the field".

Hello all,

I know, I know... the updates have been few and far between. But
here it goes.

Its about 1:30 pm on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon.  I had a safe
trip to Ooty and back chaperoning the high school girls field
hockey trip. Ooty is another hill station about an 8 hour bus trip
from here. The students travel there about 3 times a semester to
compete in various sporting events. Its significantly bigger so there
are more schools (and more shopping opportunities) there to
compete with. We left Thursday afternoon and arrived Thursday
evening. On Friday, it was the outdoor field hockey competition
between 4 schools. The girls won 2nd place. On Saturday the girls
won first place in indoor hockey. Hebron, a British missionary
school, hosted the tournament. It was the first time I saw so many
people that looked like me. It was unbelievable how many blond
hair, blue-eyed people there were. Hebron was founded around the
same time Kodaikanal International School was (about 100 years
ago) and while KIS has transformed itself from a purely American
Christian school to an International School, Hebron has remained
virtually the same with regards to its Christian beginnings and to
the students enrolled. Its largely British, with Australians and New
Zealanders and very few Indian students. I had a great time getting
to know the girls and answering a lot of their questions about the
States for the 12th grade girls who have applied to colleges in the
US.

The trip was amazing, but also a bit depressing. Its so sad to travel
through. Some of the living conditions are unbelievably poor
especially in the plains. We are also so fortunate to be able to live
the way we do.  Anyways... I am also extremely busy substituting
a 9th grade English honors class. The teacher is out for 2 weeks
for a supposed spider bite and skin graph. I really wish I had paid
more attention in high school. The students are reading
Shakespeare and luckily its Romeo and Juliet. ITs about the only
Shakespeare story that anyone can fumble through. It was to
initially be a supervisory role when we thought he would be out 3
days but its now more a teaching role since hes out for 2 weeks.
Can't wait for him to return.

Gotta run. Want to try to take a nap before ultimate frisbee. Didn't
make it home until 3 am last night from Ooty. I will be sending
another email mid-March after long weekend. I am heading to the
southern state of Kerala with Priya and her family for a boating
backwaters trip through some Indian villages.

Hope all is well! Take care.

Love,
Lisa
