James:

As discussed, you will update this information with Rod Hayslett, in specific regard to the "estimate" information that I have generated.  I do not wish to change any of the rate data provided by Southern LNG in the excel spreadsheet, although your comments as to specific areas of concern are most helpful, as I expect Southern LNG to come forth with a number of changes at the time of their "True-Up Filing" with the FERC (October 2001 or so).

We talked about the additional costs of the docking pilots on the standby tugs (versus your estimate).

We talked about certain costs that you are going to check with El Paso Merchant Energy (maintenance dredging).

We really have two stripping alternatives - I have shown only ours, as adjusted.  However, I agree with the need to reflect the proposal advanced by El Paso Merchant Energy.  Please work with Rod Hayslett on setting up this alternative in the spreadsheet.

The reason to have Rod develop the model is so we can quickly calculate what the cost-of-service impact will be for various capital projects and, hence, what the comparative economics are.

Regards.
Les
