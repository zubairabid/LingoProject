David and Heidi,
Hope you enjoyed your Easter holiday and your Anzac holiday!
With respect to your question of whether the financial trader services can be
charged at cost or must have a 7.5% mark-up, I received advice from Chris
Catt at PWC-Sydney last summer that there needed to be a mark-up for these
services.  Given the skills required by the financial trader and the risk
associated with the transactions, Chris advised that there needed to be a
mark-up over cost based on a recent ruling by the ATO.
The ATO issued TR 1999/1 in January 1999, which provides a safe-harbor for de
minimis services that are provided by an Australian company and meet certain
monetary limitations.  Under the de miminis safe harbor, where the costs
associated with all services provided by Enron Australia Pty Limited to
offshore affiliates do not exceed A$500,000 in a year, the safe harbor
mark-up of 7.5% may be available.  Paragraph 86 of the ruling sets forth the
requirements as follows:
"As mentioned in paragraph 77, the Commissioner will apply a similar
administrative practice in de minimis cases where the total direct and
indirect costs of supplying services to Australian or foreign associated
enterprises, as appropriate, is not more than $500,000 in a year.  The
practice applies to all intra-group services supplied or acquired where the
relevant cost limit is not exceeded.  Therefore, in some cases, it might be
applicable to all intra-groups services both supplied and acquired.  The
transfer prices that must be used, and the conditions for their use, are the
same as those specified in paragraphs 82 to 84.  As for the practice in
relation to non-core services, all taxpayers in a group must use the same
mark-up, for incoming and outgoing services, in respect of each foreign
jurisdiction, but the mark-up may vary from country to country, within the
limits described above.
Example
An Australian subsidiary of a foreign based multinational group receives
marketing and technical assistance from a foreign associate. No other
services are acquired by any Australian member of the group from its foreign
associated enterprises.  The total direct and indirect costs of providing the
services to the Australian subsidiary for the year are $200,000.  As long as
the amount actually charged for the services is not more than $215,000 (or
$220,000 in the circumstances outlined in paragraph 83), the Commissioner
would not require the taxpayer to establish an arm,s length price for the
services."
Based on discussions we had late last summer, we thought that the A$500,000
threshold could be met.
To my knowledge, the recent changes and proposed changes to the Australian
tax rules would not affect TR 1999/1.  Please let me know if you have seen
anything to the contrary.  Consequently, to my knowledge, we are still under
these guidelines.  I,m not sure, David, what you mean by 100% being current
practice as stated in your April 18th e-mail.  I am guessing that you are
referring to the services provided under the cost sharing agreement.  Under
that agreement, office costs are being shared by Enron Australia Pty Limited
and 3 other Australian entities.  Here, services are being provided to an
off-shore affiliate.  As a result, it appears that TR 1999/1 would require a
mark-up.
I will be happy to discuss this with you both at your convenience.
