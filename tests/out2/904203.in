Health & Fitness Tip of the Day
Thursday November 16, 2000

Lunging Across The Floor

To tone and strengthen hamstrings and gluteus muscles, try performing lunges
across the floor. Start by standing with your feet together, then take a
giant step forward with your right leg. Let your right knee bend to a
90-degree angle, so that your hips are on the same level as your right knee.
Slowly stand and bring your left leg forward to meet your right leg, so that
you've taken a big step forward. Perform 10 steps on the right leg, then 10
on the left leg. Increase by working up to three sets of 10, and make it even
harder by holding 10-pound weights in your hands.
