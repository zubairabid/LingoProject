Hope each of you had a Merry Christmas and enjoyed your time off........

Here is response from Joe at Calpine. In addition to his memo, we also need
to verify intra-day nomination procedures with PGT in the event of force
majeure type interruptions at points other than Malin. Since we cannot give
force majeure protection at Alternate Points of Delivery, they need to
understand scheduling flexibility in the event a nomination needs to be
redirected to Malin.

Joe also asked for more information on the "renewal" process on ANG and
NOVA. Peter/Eric: we will need your assistance. Does any information
pertaining to this reside in their tariffs?

Please look at this first thing in the am. We are going for signatures on
Wednesday!
