Attached please find a chart that summarizes the differences between IXC and
CLEC obligations for Texas, New York and Illinois.  This project was meant to
incorporate California and Florida; however, I have not yet received any
information from our counsel in CA and I only received the pertinent
information from our counsel in Florida late last night and this morning.  I
apologize that I was not able to include any information from those states.
I will incorporate their information when I return from vacation.
I have asked Gloria to provide some of you with copies of the material that I
received from Florida  to utilize in my absence (e.g., Sue, Donald, Scott).
You should already have the material from TX, IL and NY.
Please let me know if anyone has any questions or concerns.  Thank you.
Regards,
