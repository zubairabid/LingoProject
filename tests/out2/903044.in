Thursday, November 2 is our next, less than quarterly, meeting to up date you
on events that willl affect your business in the Western U.S.

The meeting is at the Hyatt downtown, 1200 Louisiana, starting at 11:30AM. A
casual lunch will be served. The meeting will start at 12:30PM. If we can
make it last with lots of good questions and a healthy exchange of views,
cocktails will be on me in the lobby bar after the meeting--meeting
attendance is manditory. The agenda looks like this:

The ever popular Parking Service--An overview with discussion of Pipeline
Inventory issues and the go forward plan to help fix the problem.

A rundown on the elimination of the IT Queue and our filing for re-hearing

An overview of West Region demand and expansion plans--everyone will want to
sign up for this

Implementation of IT blanket based discounting--maybe, only if you're good

Nomination dynamics and pro rata ranking plan implementation

E-Trans implementation

AND FINALLY--TCPL will present their gas supply views for the Alberta
systems--an added bonus!

This is also an opportunity for you to share changes in your organizations
that others would apppreciate knowing about--name changes, mergers, spin
offs, divestitures, etc.

Feel free to nominate others in your organization that would benefit.
