Steve: Per your instructions, Chris and I met and discussed your comments
last week regarding the Fontheim proposal to provide representation to Enron
at the rate of $10,000 per month plus expenses (these should be quite
minimal) from date of execution through the balance of the year.

Claude Fontheim is well known in Washington and did serve in a trade capacity
early in the Clinton Administration. Chris and I have know two of his
operatives Sally Painter and Ken Levinson for several years. Sally was the
deputy director of the DOC business liason office and later with Tenneco and
Ken was legislative director to Senator Rockefeller. We believe they have a
good reputation and provide professional representation of the highest
quality.

While their strength as Chris and I see it is there relationships in the
Clinton-Gore White House, they are particularly close to the New Democrats
(trade and commerce supporters in Congress) and have good ties into the
environmental community. They have made various suggestions to us in the past
and offered advice both of which have been useful to Enron. Therefore, while
we have been discussing their value in our desire to have good ties with the
Gore organization which they have, Chris and I also see value they can bring
to other issues of importance to Enron including the electricity
restructuring legislation.

We recommend them and await your decision.

Joe
