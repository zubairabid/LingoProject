Steve,

I think personally it's a great idea, though my son, who studies
computer science, poured a bucket of icy water on me. Computers
are becoming very cheap and most companies have already a lot of
spare capacity on their systems.

But we can always try. We shall take this idea, to the person in EBS
responsible for the
new products and ask him to talk directly to you to discuss the details.

EBS is dying to come up with some new products.
