Daren,

Charlotte Hawkins is having trouble confirming the volume of 5,733 with El
Paso.  El Paso will not confirm the volume that high.  EOG revised their
nomination as follows:

C/P Name Meter #  Orig Nom Rev Nom

EOG Res. 6296  5,733  2,300

Will you approve revising the volume in Unify down to 2,300?  Please advise.
Thanks.

Bob
