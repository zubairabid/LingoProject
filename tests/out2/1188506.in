Edmund:
Thanks for your voice mail and sorry for the delay, just a couple of
questions and minor points ont eh GTC -
In paragraph 1, the usual practice in North America would be for the executed
confirmation to control over other evidence.
Since online credit derivatives are not traded under our existing master
agreements, we need to make clear to the Credit Group that these positions
should not be included when they determine their rights to call for
collateral under the masters.
I'm not familiar with the fraud limitation towards the end of Section 6.  Is
this particular to credit derivatives?
With respect to the third paragraph of Section 9, we need to be aware that
these GTC's can be accepted by any EOL user while the ETA must be accepted by
the Mater User.  It is not entirely clear that all sub-users will have the
authority to amend the ETA.  Is the purpose of the second sentence to
"deactivate" master agreements that might otherwise control the transaction?
If so, in other circumstances where we needed to force the GTC to override a
master, we have taken additional steps to notify the affected
counterparties.  (I can't remember if we required that the counterparty
execute a side letter or if we just notified them that acceptance of the GTC
would acknowledge that the master did not control.)
I'm sure you guys have spent untold hours on the definition of Bankruptcy
Event, but I do want to point out that under US bankruptcy law it is
impossible to have an involuntary bankruptcy dismissed within 30 days.  If we
actually want the poor unsuspecting Reference Entity to have a chance to have
the case dismissed, 90 days might do it (I am told that the various periods
for notices and responses prior to the date a hearing may be held add up to
more than 60 days).
I'm uncomfortable with the use of the term "Month."  What would the Effective
Date be for a transaction entered into on December 30?  You could argue that
it is either the last day of February or the first or second day of March.
The ambiguity could be resolved by using a number of days and a business day
convention.
This is probably an issue for all of our derivatives  -  should we apply a
different interest rate to non-US$ payments?
It is Mark Haedicke's relatively unwavering policy that US. derivatives
trading agreements be subject to arbitration.  We rarely submit to the
jurisdiction of NY courts unless the counterparty is incorporated outside the
US.  Unless you have received a special dispensation from Mark, there is some
straightforward arbitration language in the ENA financial GTC.
Our other derivatives agreements contain confidentiality provisions - have we
decided not to include one here for a particular reason?
Again. sorry for the delay.  I will be here all week and happy to discuss any
of these points.
