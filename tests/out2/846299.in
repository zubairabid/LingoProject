Joe, part of this deal is repayment of the sub debt at par and a series of
cashflows that we would probably like to monetize.  Have you looked at this?

Jeff, I would like to get your view on the economics - basically they are
giving us 89% of our carry value in cash and 11% of our carry value in a
contingent payment payable at restructuring or sale of their partnership.
Lets discuss ASAP.
