I think it's a good document and carves out some solid policy ground for
Bush.  I think the electricity section needs some additions though.  There is
not a lot that the current administration can do about siting new plants and
power lines -- its largely a state and local decision.  Further, the problem
has been less about government failing to provide adequate incentives to
utilities than it has been about a failure of the current commission to
opening the grid on a nondiscriminatory basis.  Once utilities are in the
open access transmission business they will look for ways to invest in the
grid and stop getting in the way of independent power producers who want to
connect to the grid.  The answer is open access, so power can get from where
it is to where it is needed.  This has been clear for a long time, yet the
current administration (and its appointees on FERC) have yet to use their
authority to make this happen.  The result: spiking prices and reliability
problems.
