Dear Gerald Nemec,

Option trading is now available at Datek Online-for just $9.99 plus
$1.75 per contract.

This new capability's highlights include:

A suitability test that determines the level of option trading
that's appropriate for individuals who seek to use our system.

A state-of-the-art online order entry system.

Real-time market and account information that helps our
customers choose sensible option strategies.

Most competitors charge quite a bit more for an option trade.*

To learn more about option-based investment strategies and their
risks, visit the Datek Online Learning Center. If you decide that
option-based investment strategies are right for you, complete and
send us your application and Datek will determine the level of option
trading that's appropriate for you.


Sincerely,
