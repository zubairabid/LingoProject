TXU revised their rates for Jan 2001. They are now billing us at $0.10 and $0.08 for contract 1671.  This was previously billed all at $0.10.  Please change the demand fee on deal 384258 from $3,841,888.11 to $3,830,131.18.
Also, I spoke to TXU about the rate on contract 1856 (deal 452475).  They have been billing us $0.11 and we have $0.10.  The extra cent is for the El Paso header fee.  The pricing you gave me is for contract 1671, but also has the header fee if you look on page 5 of 6.  You'll see a a section called "Compression & Header Expense if Utilized".  The current rate for 1856 is $0.01 and 0% fuel.  I will leave a copy of the contract in your chair.
