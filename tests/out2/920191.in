I thought I would send this to you as an fyi only.

Yesterday, I received a call out of the blue from Greg Hermans who will be
heading up the steel trading efforts for EIM.  He wanted me to come right up
and talk to them about EnronOnline and how to get their products on the web.
So, of course, we responded immediately and met with them for about an hour
on what they want to do.  I knew we were going to start trading steel, but
had not heard from Dave that we were going to do this online.  So, I sent
Andy and Dave the message below detailing the discussion and asked for
thoughts/concerns going forward.  This will not require any technical
changes, enhancements, etc., and should be very easy for us to handle....  I
received the responses below from Dave, and sent him my response.  I am not
sure if he is upset that they called me instead of him, but there is no
reason that I should not have the authority to take care of these things.
And the intention was to inform them both in case they did have concerns.

I am on vacation beginning this afternoon, and will return on Monday (I am
going to send out a note as you suggested in the past before I leave).

thanks-
Sheri
