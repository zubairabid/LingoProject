Elizabeth,
Per your request, I have prepared the following summary.
Western RTO Development:
RTO West.
Area to be included -- WA, OR, ID, MT, Western WY, UT, NV-North & South and
hopefully Canada (BC Hydro and possibly Alberta)
Filed with FERC "Stage 1" documents in October 2000 -- Governance, Bylaws,
Draft of Operating Agreement, etc.
Stage 2 development begun January 2001 with of complete proposal in July 2001
Earliest practical operation Fall 2002 (optimistic based on quick on approval
time)
Plan Quality -- Good overall
Attractive Features -- independent board, single control area and real time
voluntary energy market, all parties on same tariff, a tradeable transmission
right with "use or lose" anti-hoarding provisions.
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to
existing users for a ten year period ("use or lose" will mitigate for short
term rights but long term rights on existing system will be tough to get).
Desert STAR.
Area to be included -- AZ, NM, CO, Eastern WY
Governance established and Board has been organized.
Have not yet filed a complete plan
Earliest practical operation Winter 2002 or beyond, depending on when they
actually file their proposal
Plan quality --  Potentially promising
Attractive Features -- similar transmission right regime as RTO West
Unknown -- whether they will have a single control area, whether
Unattractive Features -- Majority of transmission rights allocated to
existing users, board selection committee was manipulated by publics (however
in practice the independent board selected seems to have been little affected
by the search firm nomination process)
CA-ISO.
Area included -- CA IOU's only
Fully operational but with CA/FERC jurisdictional struggle over Board
appointment and independence.
Modifications to meet Order 2000 have been filed which appear to move
transmission rights close to the proposals under discussion in RTO West and
Desert STAR
Cooperative Regional Organization Activity:
Seams.
A joint task force of parties involved in RTO West, Desert STAR and CA-ISO
began meeting in November 2000
Three major seams issues identified and work begun
Scheduling time lines -- aligning processes between three RTOs so that
business across seams boundaries is not hampered for administrative reasons.
Nature of transmission rights and effect on loop flow -- making the
congestion management systems work between the three RTOs.
Export fees -- goal is to eliminate pancaking of fixed cost charges between
RTOs, perhaps by annual transfer payments between RTOs or some other
reciprocity agreement.
RTG Consolidation.
WRTA. SWRTA and WSCC voted to merge in to a single organization, the WIO
(Western Interconnection Organization)
WIO will have three committee:   Planning, Operations, Market Interface.
The Northwest organization (NRTA) has decided to stay independent for now,
but if RTO West forms it may just disappear as a separate organization.
If you need more detail, please let me know.
