Daren,

Below, I have attached the information that I initially sent out to the
managers.
If you would please forward me your customer and employee trip designation
as well as
their addresses as soon as possible I would really appreciate it.

Again, I am sorry for the mistake in not including you in this email.  I
assure you it will not
happen again.  And please let me know if there is anything I can do to help
you.

- Heather
