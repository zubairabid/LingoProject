Hey, we need to talk.  So far I've gotten Duncan's check and that's it.  I
have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that
they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they
are not....so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not
have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it
would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying
when they plan on paying...I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's
friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just
don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and
I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you
never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know
whether I should use it to get in touch with you.

Anyway, I just got back from NYC...had a great time, except for the fact that
Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just
kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed
quickly.
