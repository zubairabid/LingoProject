Looks like a real time guy put this deal in - along with three others - for
El Paso. Real Time isn't used to marking confirms on their deals, since
they're usually just trading hour-ahead. Let me know how you'd like these to
be changed (i.e. "yes-agreement" or "yes-counterparty to send confirm"), and
I'll do that right away.
