Enron's first Blood Drive of 2001 will be held on Thursday, February 22, from
7am - 4pm in EB-5c2.  If you haven't already registered, please contact the
Enron Health Center at ext. 3-6100 to schedule an appointment to donate
blood.  Walk-ins are welcome!

Through our partnership with M.D. Anderson Cancer Center Enron employees
assist not only the Houston community but also our employees and their
families. Your generosity has enabled Enron to give 877 blood unit credits to
fellow employees and family members in need.  Let's continue the spirit of
giving.
