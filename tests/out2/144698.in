People -
I'm not sure now if 11:00 a.m. is going to work for the big conference
call next week.  I'm wondering if earlier or later in the day will work
for you guys . . . say 8:00 a.m. or 4-5:00 p.m.???  I am leaving work
right now and heading to the airport so try to respond to my home e-mail
cattlepig@earthlink.net    and I will retrieve your responses once I'm
in California in a couple of days.  If 11:00 is definately the only time
then I can work around it and make that call . . . . whatever you three
decide is what I will abide by.

108 years ago today, in 1892,  Andrew and Abby Borden were axed to death
in their home in Fall River, Mass. Lizzie Borden, Andrew Borden's
daughter from a previous marriage, was accused of the killings, but was
acquitted.
