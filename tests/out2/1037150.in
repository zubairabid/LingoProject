John -- Sorry we did not catch up when I was in Houston in December.  At the time, I was in the process of leaving the company I helped to start  and have joined a sports marketing agency to build their international business.
At some point, I would be interested in speaking with you about some projects (domestic and international) that we're working on.  One of our business groups specialize in the stadium/properties naming rights field and there are some great opportunities including the new Pittsburgh Steelers stadium.  I thought one of your companies or possibly New Power might have an interest in taking a look at it.  Let me know when you have a free moment.
Cheers, BA
