Russell:
I am working with Tana on the Engage US amendment.  There should be no open
issues, but before I left I sent some e-mails to Luke Mickum, their attorney
which he never responded to.
Tana,
Please ask Mary Cook to review the Engage Canada Guaranty from West Coast.
The comments that I made to the other Engage Guaranty which I have forwarded
to you should apply here.  Has their attorney in Canada responded to  the
Engage Canada amendment?  The latest draft of the Engage US amendment and the
latest draft of the Engage Canada amendment I believe is still on your system
and should be in the file, but you and Mary should both follow up with their
attorney based on the e-mails that I sent to him which I have forwarded to
you.
