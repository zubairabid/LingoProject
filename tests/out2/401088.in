Hi Mum!  The trip was pretty exhausting.  Friday we saw Hoover Dam, had lunch
at a great diner in Kingman (on Route 66!) and rolled into Sedona around 5.
Climbed around the red rocks of Sedona all day on Saturday, sat by the pool
in the afternoon and I did some shopping.   Sunday we drove to Grand Canyon
and did part of the Bright Angel trail.  That was pretty strenuous but
definitely worth it.  Wish we could have made it a longer trip but we had
Bill's trial schedule to deal with.  I'll spare you the details of my trip
home -- suffice it to say I didn't make it back to Houston until about noon
yesterday and have a $200 travel voucher for my trouble.

I will definitely come to Austin next weekend but probably will not get in
until later on Saturday.  How about a homemade (by Chef Sooz) brunch on
Sunday a.m.?

Have to run to a meeting ... for race info, I would try a search for Texaco
or Texaco Gran(d?) Prix on the Internet.  I know that Texaco probably has it
on their website.  If you don't find anything let me know.
Love,
Sooz
