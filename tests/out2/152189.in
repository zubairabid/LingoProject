Mark,  Attached is the letter agreement we discussed.  Please review.  It is
rough.
Some issues to note:
1.  The Kern PA cannot be assigned without their consent, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld.  If Kern didn't like the fact that we are receiving
assignment from 3 or 4 other shippers, they might withhold consent if they
thought we were superceding their bid procedures.  Not sure if they would,
but it is a risk.
2.  If the assignment is done after the producer executes the firm transport
agreement, Kern could require to capacity to be released via capacity release
at max rate.
3.  I took a stab at the mark-to-market calculation.  Probably needs more
substance though.
Lets discuss.
