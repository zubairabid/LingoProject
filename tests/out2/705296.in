Just wanted to update you on the Dept of Fish & Game 1603 notification.

I spoke with Clarence Mayott in the DFG Fresno office.  He said based on his
knowledge of the area and the information provided that our project should
not require 1603 permitting.  He did want to see the notification package
and anticipates providing a letter stating that the project is outside the
scope of Section 1600 of the Fish & Game code.  He also commented on CEQA
(Calif. Env. Quality Act) requirements, particularly the wildlife and
habitat issues.  He thinks that with the CESA 2081 permit and a letter from
Kern County regarding the ministerial nature of this project, we might be
able claim that CEQA has been addressed.  This will be ultimately decided by
either the Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB) or State Rec Board
as these are state agencies which may be issuing discretionary permits.  If
either of these agencies requires CEQA analysis, they may rely on the
County's letter and the 2081 permit, or they would have to do their own CEQA
analysis.  I'm working on getting a letter from the Kern County Planning
Dept.  Do you have a copy of the 2081 documents?  This is one document I
never received from EOTT.
