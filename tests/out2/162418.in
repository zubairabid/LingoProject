Announcement for E220-1: Corporate Financial Reporting:


Greetings,
I am not sure if all of you have now been contacted by the Haas computer
center about resolving your Izio web site access.

I have not heard either way.  I must say I have been quite disappointed by
their lack of follow-up.

I will bring copies of all the class lecture material to class this evening.
There is nothing for you to download or print.
Kindly,
Salvador
