Per an email from Soma yesterday, Brian Hull wanted to transact out of their
Toronto Branch, so I used their Toronto address in the agreement.  We do not
have "transactions numbers" on our ISDA's.  I would take it if things proceed
today, that we will date the agreement as of today, so the date of the
agreement will be the only identifying information.  Toronto-Dominion will
need to look at the notice information I put in the agreement and confirm
that it is acceptable.  I pulled it from a recent agreeement they sent us.
