Thank you, we will use your form to satisfy Schedule to Master Agreement,
Part 3 -evidence of authority and specimen signatures (OK?) BCS would like
either Doug or Stew Thomas to be able sign the ISDA, depending on who is
available at the time. I assume I can simply include both of their names,
titles and signatures in this Certificate. Is this OK?  Thanks for your
help.
