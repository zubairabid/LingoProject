Hi Paul and Chris,
Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local
production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500
dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it
all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it
on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi
nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not
sure about the Power, until I checked and sure enough the nom isn't out there
yet.
I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I
want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will
call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the
last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the
clarifications!
