The Board of Directors of GISB decided yesterday at their quarterly Board of
Directors meeting to continue discussions with EEI and other interested
groups regarding the formation of an Energy Standards Board.

Stan Horton, GISB's Chairman, stated "while there are many differences
between the approaches advanced by GISB and EEI, there are also alot of
similarities."   GISB is hoping to respond to the stawman advanced by EEI by
the end of January.
GISB is also seeking input from other interested industry segments on the two
proposals which have been advanced thus far.
