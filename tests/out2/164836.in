Wine Team Picks: Tim Gaiser on Heroic Wines

Heroic Wines is one of my own personal vino categories. A wine is
"heroic" when it has a bold, distinct character and far surpasses my
expectations in terms of complexity and value. Here are my current
heroic picks:

1999 Chateau de Segries Lirac Cuvee Reserve, France, $11.00
1998 Domaine de L'Oratoire St.-Martin Cotes-du-Rhone Villages
Carainne, Reserve des Seigneurs, St.-Martin, France, $16.00
1997 Mas Grand Plagniol Syrah (embossed bottle), Costieres de Nimes,
France, $18.00
1998 Peter Lehmann Wines Clancy's, Barossa Valley,
Australia, $19.95
1993 d'Arenberg The Ironstone Pressings, McLaren Vale,
Australia, $49.95

Wine with Chocolate: Dry or Sweet?

The holidays are a time of indulgence, and chocolate is pure
indulgence. Pairing it with wine, however, is a tricky -- even
controversial -- endeavor.

"There are two camps: those who believe that dry wines like Merlot
and Cabernet Sauvignon are good with chocolate, and those who prefer
it with sweet wines," says wine.com Senior Wine Merchant Tim Gaiser,
summing up the controversy.

The dry-wine camp "thinks that the bitterness of tannin is a good
match with the bitterness of chocolate," says Gaiser. It may seem odd
to be discussing dessert (which most people would consider sweet) in
terms of bitterness, but as Gaiser points out, "That's the flavor of
cocoa, which is found in all high-quality chocolate."

Gaiser believes that some Merlots can handle this assignment "because
of their soft tannins and the supple, seductive quality of their
fruit." Wine.com's sampler gift pack of Ballentine Merlot and
Scharffen Berger Chocolate plays on this flavor profile.

The more traditional palate prefers sweet wines to match the sugar in
chocolate and offset its bitterness. For this, Gaiser says the wine
"has to be really ripe and intense. High alcohol is almost necessary,
because it implies ripeness and richness."

In this category, he suggests that "port is probably best --
especially tawny port. Australian liqueur Muscats like Stanton &
Killeen are also terrific, as are fine cream sherries, such as the
1972 Bodegas Toro Albala Pedro Ximenez Don Gran Reserva (375 ml)
or the Emilio Lustau Moscatel Las Cruces 100 Anos. Wine.com also
offers a Decadent Dessert pack that pairs an outstanding Schuetz
Oles Port with melt-in-your-mouth XOX chocolate truffles.

Although he loves sweet German wines, Gaiser steers away from them
when it comes to chocolate. "You need the depth of red grape
varieties," he says. "One very influential wine writer thinks that
the perfect wine for chocolate is Banyuls. It's a Grenache-based red
wine, fortified to 18-20 percent alcohol." For an already-assembled
combo, try our Banyuls and Chocolate Bars gift pack, which includes
the 1998 L'Abbe Rous Banyuls Rimage with six of the finest chocolates
available. Gaiser also points out that "Some Banyuls are capable of
aging, just like port". As proof, try the 1993 L'Abbe Rous Banyuls
Grand Cru Christian Reyal.

If you want to stick to unfortified wine from the United States,
nothing could be more appropriate than late-harvest Zinfandel, whose
raspberry-tinged varietal character is a classic match
with chocolate.

When it comes to the final ingredient, wine.com has several
first-rate holiday chocolates to offer. Some already have wine inside
them -- for example, Wine-Filled Chocolates and Chocolate Champagne
Corks. For a delicious Italian milk chocolate with hazelnuts, try
Vineyard Chocolates.

Wine Tastings at the Olive Garden

Nobody has worked harder than the Olive Garden restaurants at
bringing authentic Italian cuisine to America. In keeping with the
place that wine occupies on the Italian table, the restaurant now
offers wine tastings on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights. This
week, its list features a Chianti Classico Riserva from Rocca delle
Macie, as well as the Beringer Founders' Estate Cabernet Sauvignon,
Gallo of Sonoma Chardonnay, and Montevina White Zinfandel. We join
arms with the Olive Garden in endorsing the old Italian proverb, "The
only wrong wine is no wine at all."
