Mark:  I have scheduled a 5 pm flight to NO.  I am attending a wedding Friday
night.  I hope this is not a problem, but let me know.  Also, did you receive
my voice mail about the Goldman electronic agreement and their denial of my
request for injunctive relief upon proof of breach?  I'd like to finalize
this agreement.  Thanks.  Sara
