Ken & Jeff,

Each year I attend the Enron Management Conference the more I realize that
the daily leadership and vision that the Office of the Chairman provides is
what allows us to meet and exceed our goals. That leadership and vision in
turn empowers every employee to do their job and that empowerment translates
into continued success. That is what make Enron so unique in the global
marketplace. Thank you for making this such a great company to work for.

Doug
