The following is a summary of our findings for selecting a Risk System for
the ETS Marketing Department.  Meetings were held with Richard Burchfield,
Stephen Stock and Steve Nat to review the TAGG, ERMS and EnPower systems as
possible alternatives for a risk system for ETS.  Lee Ferrell and Vernon
Mercaldo represented the ETS commerical group.   In summary,  ETS is looking
for a risk system that is fully integrated from Deal Capture to Billing and
can be implemented in the 30-60 day timeframe.  They are anticipating maximum
concurrent users of about 10 with approximately 20 deals per month.  Overall,
it looks like the Caminus package offers ETS a faster and smoother
implementation, does not expose us to any market affiliate violations or
suspicions and is reasonably affordable with an estimated on-going
maintenance costs of less than $100,000/year.  The following provides more
details and I have attached a functional comparison.  Please let me know if
you have any questions or further followup that I need to address.  Thanks.

Summary of Findings
Based on our discussion with Richard Burchfield and Stephen Stock, we
rejected the possibility of using TAGG and ERMS because these applications
are not able to handle spread options (one of the key ETS requirements).
Richard suggested we take a look at EnPower.  This system was considered a
closer fit and also more portable.  After closer inspection,  the EnPower
System is not currently a  fully integrated product.  There are plans to
integrate several of components into the product, but at this time, the
system has interfaces to several other external applications including the
following:

RAC for Risk Management
DECAF for deal confirmations
PORTCALC/TAGG/ERMS for loading price curves and price calculations
UNIFY for billing
Desktop Models for Settlement
Global Counterparty for Trading Partner and Credit

All of the above applications would have to be certified by an outside party
to make sure that we could protect all parties regarding Market Affiliates.
This would entail evaluating each system's current security, testing and
possibly requiring changes to meet security requirements.  This process could
take a significant amount of time to complete and might still constitute a
violation of the marketing affiliate rules or would at minimum create the
appearance of marketing affiliate violations.  We discussed this alternative
with Drew Fossum, NNG Legal Counsel, and Drew is in concurrence with this
opinion.

Regarding costs, the IT team did not attempt to estimate an on-going support
costs figure since there would be several factors to consider.  Additionally,
there is a concern regarding how the Pipelines would achieve priority on
getting their production problems and enhancements addressed considering the
current demands on IT resources.
