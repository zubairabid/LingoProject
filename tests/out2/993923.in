Dear TI reader,

TigerInvestor.com is now closed. I would like to sincerely thank the writers,
members, and readers for their amazing contributions over the years. The TI
community has bar-none been the best, most thoughtful, sophisticated
community of the investors on the net. I am proud of what we accomplished,
shared, and learned together. I wish you all the very best. God bless on all
your endeavors.

For assorted reasons, I decided to step down and close the site. Don,t
worry, I will fulfill the promise of your privacy and keep your email
addresses totally confidential.

If you want to reach me, I would love to hear from you. Email me at
kimtj@aol.com or visit my personal homepage athttp://www.taekim.com, which I
update with my daily thoughts on life. All the best and happy holidays!

contribute to http://www.eglobalinvestor.com, so do take a gander.
