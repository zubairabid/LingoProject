Attached in support of Agenda Item 5B , ICAP, for the December 12, 2000
Business Issues Committee meeting, and pursuant to the motion passed at the
December 1, 2000 BIC meeting, are the following documents:
1. A clean version of proposed Tariff language on Stage 1A ICAP, consisting
of all those modifications made by the ICAPWG over the course of their
deliberations in the last few months with the exception of  (1) UCAP and (2)
one month OPP; and
2. A blacklined version of that proposed Tariff, marked to show changes from
the current Tariff.
The clean version includes a table of contents for ease of review.
Please note that, pursuant to the motion passed by BIC on December 1,
substantive changes not included in the ICAPWG November 21 Proposed Tariff
(considered by BIC on December 1) must be presented on separate motion at
the December 12 meeting.  The ISO has one such change, to Section 5.12.10;
the language was circulated prior to the December 1 BIC meeting and will be
recirculated tomorrow.
Please call or write with questions or comments. Many thanks.
