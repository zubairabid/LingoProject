A couple of things I wanted to tell you.

1.  There is a company in Houston named "Compsys".  I have been told they
are the contract agency who places computer staff here.  Which is a good way
to get in. Sorry, I do not have their number.

2.   In addition to searching enron.com, also search enron.net, this is our
broadband network.
