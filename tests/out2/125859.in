Mary,
I see that Phil Bair from JWorthan has responded to Phil DeMoes concerning
the bond term.  No comments were made concerning the legal opinion for the
legal counsel for the bond provider.  I was going to suggest that the
contract language be modified to provide that the Company had a reasonable
amount of time at the end of the lst 5 yr bond term to provide a substitute
bond for the remaining term and that if the Company was able to get a
replacement bond in place before the expiration of such period, no default
would occur.  Can you tell from the letter that Phil Bair is proposing if
their are any other issues that either ENRON or the Bond Provider would have
concerning the terms of the Bond and the Customer's methods of getting
funding thereunder.

This was forwarded to me by Phil DeMoes.
Dan,
Take a look at this letter prepared by our surety provider on the PEAK
pre-pay.  In particular, note the last paragraph.  I'm concerned on the
unwind if there is a default.   We plan to meet tomorrow with Joe Deffner and
Breese tomorrow morning.  Are you available?
