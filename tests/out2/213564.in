Yes.  We talked this morning, and I am pleased with the results.  We talked
about integrating our offices fully.  We agreed that I would put together an
office seat assignment chart, which would move John and his folks into our
section of the office.  This will allow  us to more fully integrate our
activities on a daily if not hourly means.  We also talked about how John and
Tom should think about our involvement on international issues.  Our basic
framework, which will need further definition, is to consolidate Joe Hillings
activities into John's  and Tom's portfolios.  By that I see John handling
project based activity and Tom predominantly handling international
legislative issues.  There will of course be overlap but I think the friction
we have seen in the office to date should be mitigated with this approach.
Tom has a very full plate, and even with our new hires, I do not see Tom's
domestic (such as energy and commodities) activities dropping off that much.
This too should lessen friction.  John and I also talked about consolidating
our budgets.  I explained to him how that has worked to date with Joe
Hartsoe's group.  John and I also discussed our outside counsel in the
international arena, including McLarty.  John thought Mac could be very
helpful to us and that we can better focus Mac's assignments.   We also
discussed that I planned to end or multilaterize the Hills Co. engagement at
the end of March.  I am prepared to recommend that we either terminate the
engagement or ask other members of the coaltion to pay an equal share of the
cost, thus potentially our cost to a $2/3K level per month from its current
level of $20K.  I doubt members will be willing to give up their free ride,
so my guess is that we will be terminating the contract.
