Hello, for future notices Jeff Sorenson is not in my group and does not work
with us.  They don't pass documents on to our group.  If their is a way that
you all can tell if a particular document is related to power and can send me
a copy if it is related to power that would be great.  There was an agreement
with Puget Sound (an intermediate agreement until we get an ISDA signed) that
was given to Jeff Sorenson's group and I never knew it existed.  Therefore I
sent a confirm out incorrectly.
Could you possibly ask one of the runners to bring me a copy of this
assignment?  My location is 3116a.  I would appreciate it.
