Mark:  I am mobilizing my team to make this work for this year!   I agree
that we should move on it for this holiday season...Laura Schwartz, our PR
manager, is talking with KRBE about their interest and how to make it
happen.  Charla Reese on my team has also contacted the Cycling Club to see
if they are interested in doing a drive.  I am happy to send you our Matching
Gift form and our VIP (Volunteer Incentive Program) form for you to
complete.  Misha Siegel can answer any questions about Matching Gifts and VIP.
Would you like to continue to get updates as we move forward on this instead
of a formal meeting - its your call - just let me know and I am happy to set
one up.  My suggestion is that we wait to hear from KRBE and then we meet
with Joann from BEAR to talk about implementation.
