Stuart:

Yes.  My view of the remaining activities is as follows:

#1. We (Mark Gershon/Karen Way/myself) are currently working with the
Village of Manhattan to fufil our obligation under the Annexation Agreement
to complete certain roadway improvements.  The Village has conducted a bid
process and selected a winning bidder to complete the work.  Unfortunately,
no bidders submitted a fixed price bid to the Village.  The Village wants us
to assume the financial risk (up to $500k) of any cost overruns.  We have
pointed out that the annexation Agreement does not require us to assume that
risk.  We are attempting to work this situation out with the Village.

#2. Karen Way is working with Chicago Title to bring to closure the issues
related to the pipeline lateral easements and obtain the title policy on the
entire lateral.  It was recently brought to our attention that during the
pipeline's construction the lateral was routed across a piece of People's
Energy property without an easement being executed.  The pipeline project
manager (Dave Lazzarro is currently working to obtain this easement).

Stuart:  Can you confirm for Karen/myself if the Northern Border easement was
recorded?

#3. Mark/myself are working with the Village and the plant manager on these
issues.  There are only a couple of improvements still remaining to be
completed including a ditch being re-graded and possibly a road re-graded
with gravel.  This should represent a small time commitment to close out.

#4.  Mark/myself are working with the Village on this issue.  We have
notified our surveyor of our need to prepare platts of dedication for the two
roadways bordering the project site.  The first one to be completed should be
Pauling road since that is the roadway that issue #1 relates to (the project
owns to the middle of the roadway - we do not wish construction workers
working on our property and creating any potential liability).

#5.  There are no current plans for expansion of the facility, so this item
should require negligible work.  We have filed an air permit application for
an additional 7FA turbine at the Project, but this is just to allow for
expansion if we choose to do so.  The annexation Agreement allows us to
expand the facility without any additional local approvals.

Additional:  I have had discussions with Merle Churchill (plant manager)
regarding the potential purpose of an 8 acre parcel nearby.  Merle has been
approached by a local electrical contractor who would like to relocate his
shop out to the county.  This 8 acre parcel would be ideal and would allow us
to close out a potential sound receptor necessary for the expansion turbine.
Also, the potential need for a special use permit for the generator lead
needs to be evaluated.  I will talk with Mark Gershon on this issue.  If we
decide to proceed, then this would likely be a 3-4 month project, similar to
what we completed on the facility last year.

In general, I am working to wrap up Piper Rudnick's(PR) work on the Lincoln
Energy Center ASAP.  With regard to other Illinois development sites (Pontiac
and Plano),  I have tried to keep the majority of the work to Mark Gershon
and Karen Way.  There have been some cases where others were needed and I
have tried to limit their roles to very short, specific engagements
(environmental, sound, real estate).  I met with Chris Townsend 3 weeks ago
and stressed our desire to have Mark and Karen handling the majority of the
development work (in my opinion, they are the best and most productive uses
of personnel at PR).  The rapid speed of our development activities at Plano
and Pontiac have required them to take on very integrated roles.  This pushes
the costs up but also is a big part of our successes, thereby eliminating the
need to re-complete numerous stages of the lengthy zoning process which exist
in Illinois counties.  Having said that, we need to watch PR and their
charges closely as they have a tendency to want to involve additional people
into our development activities.

Call me to discuss.
