It occurred to me last night after you two had left that we never quantified
what constitutes a "good" girl.  And, given that oversight I may have been
remiss in stating that Wilson was not ready for said good girl.  Just as the
opinion of women in Texas differed between you Yanks and the Texas boys at
the table, I am inclined to believe that our definitions of a "good" girl may
not be in line.


P.S. -- A person in their nineties is referred to as a nonagenarian.  (We
really should have figured that one out last night.)
