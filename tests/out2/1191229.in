Justin, Enron Canada is currently in an unresolved dispute with Bank of Nova
Scotia where from our perspective Bank of Nova Scotia has essentially been
telling us to shove off.  The dispute involves BNS's purported requirement to
consent to collateral security given to Enron Canada for physical and
financial trading positions with a counterparty known as Beau Canada.
Neither Bank of Nova Scotia nor any affiliate of Bank of Nova Scotia should
be traded OnLine and all trading ought to be monitored until such time as
this matter is resolved, and this should be expressly communicated to Bank of
Nova Scotia.  They can speak to me directly at 403.974.6923 or to our
President and CEO, Rob Milnthorp at 403.974.6714.

I am copying this memo to Bill Bradford and Mark Taylor for their information.
