Carol:  Edward and I spoke with this counterparty on Wednesday (see Lotus
Notes entry).  Edward is pushing this deal for closure next week.  Tanya
knows the credit issues (A2 short term S&P commercial paper rating is
unacceptable so CP has a MAC).  We expect their outside counsel to have some
comments which we haven't yet seen.  Guaranty issues (cap amount, demand
delay).  Nothing has been scheduled formally but I am sure that Edward will
call you for assistance on Tuesday (he is out of town on Monday).  Marie has
the file and is sending CP the 1991 and 1993 definitions.  Our discussion
today was general.  Thanks for your help.  Sara
