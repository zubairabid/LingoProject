Mark,

The bigger issue is what are we going to do with EE&CC.  If their time is
coming and we need to split them up then I would agree with this but
otherwise I am not sure this is the best thing to do.  I have had very little
actual work with EE&CC in the past year and can't really comment on their
effectiveness.
