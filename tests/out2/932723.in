Michelle:  This is a stab at something to include in the newsletter.  Will
you or someone on your team rewrite as necessary?  I am in the London office
this week, so e:mail is probably the best way to get in touch with me.
Thanks.  --Sally Beck


Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last
week for all managers, directors, senior directors and vice presidents in ENW
supporting trading operations for EA, EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and
Calgary.  Operations professionals who manage risk book reporting and
anaylsis, confirmations, physical product scheduling and cash management
reaffirmed their roles in effectively accessing, managing and mitigating
operational risk.  This focus on operational risk management  will ensure the
quality of EWS' earnings and support a platform for continuing growth across
all commodities in 2001.
