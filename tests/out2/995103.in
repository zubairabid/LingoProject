A Few Million e-xecs Wanted

The shortage of Internet executives is swelling to epic proportions,
according to a recent study by IDC, a research firm focusing on the IT
industry. By 2004, companies will be short 1 million execs for the 9.2
million positions that will be in demand worldwide, predicts John Gantz,
IDC's chief research officer.

"The demand for people to manage online operations is growing so fast that
soon we will have either young people who know little about business running
multimillion dollar enterprises, or older business executives running online
activities who are clueless about the online world," Gantz says.

The deficiency will be most apparent in brick-and-mortar companies trying to
push their businesses online, Gantz says, since these companies typically
don't have processes in place to train, recruit or retain Internet workers.

Description of MBA Program
The Texas M.B.A program is a two-year, 60-credit hour, full-time program. The
seven-course (21-credit hour) core curriculum provides a broad,
cross-functional perspective followed by 13 electives. A student may choose
to concentrate in an academic discipline or follow a market-driven
specialization, such as energy finance or information management.
The selection process is highly competitive, with a 2001 class including
doctors, lawyers, consultants, Olympic competitors, military officers,
nonprofit leaders, financial analysts, marketers, bankers, entrepreneurs,
accountants, scuba divers and kick boxers. In a word, diverse.

Virtual Road Trip Take a trip to Austin, or as U.T. folks call it, "the big
surprise awaiting prospective business students." And while you're there,
stop in at Chuy's, a great place for tongue-sizzlin' Tex-Mex in a campy diner
environment. You'll find a thousand fish over the bar, tailfins from an old
car, Elvis, and other wild items on the walls and ceiling. But hey, the decor
actually works.

[GMAT Sampler]


1.  In 1988, was the number of people in City X greater than three times the
number of people in City Y?

(1)  In 1988, there were approximately 1.1 million more people in City X than
in City Y.
(2) In 1988, the 300,000 Mormons in City X made up 20 percent of its
population, and the 41,000 Buddhists in City Y made up 30 percent of its
population.

(A) if statement (1) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (2) alone is not
sufficient to answer the question asked;
(B) if statement (2) ALONE is sufficient, but statement (1) alone is not
sufficient to answer the question asked;
(C) if BOTH statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are sufficient to answer the
question asked, but NEITHER statement ALONE is sufficient;
(D) if EACH statement ALONE is sufficient to answer the question asked;
(E) if statements (1) and (2) TOGETHER are NOT sufficient to answer the
question asked, and additional data specific to the problem are needed.


2. Television programming experts maintain that with each 1% increase in the
prime-time ratings of a television station there is a 3.5% increase in the
number of people who watch its evening news program. However, in the last ten
years at Channel NTR, there was only one year of extremely high prime-time
ratings and, during that year, fewer people than ever watched Channel NTR's
evening news program.

Which of the following conclusions can properly be drawn from the statements
above?

(A) When a news program has good ratings, the channel as a whole will have
good ratings.
(B) The programming experts neglected to consider daytime news programs.
(C) The year of high ratings at NTR was a result of two hit shows that were
subsequently canceled because of contractual problems.
(D) The ten-year period in question is not representative of normal viewing
patterns.
(E) Prime-time ratings are not the only factor affecting how many people
watch an evening news program.

[THE PRINCETON REVIEW ,2000]
GMAT Sampler Answers:
1.  The correct answer is choice (B).  Statement (1) tells us how many more
people were in City X than in City Y, but since we don't know the total
population of either, we can't definitively answer this question. We can
eliminate (A) and (D), and we're down to (B), (C), or (E).

At first glance, statement (2) may not seem helpful since it talks about
Mormons and Buddhists, but in fact, this statement is sufficient. The 300,000
Mormons make up 20% of the population of City X, meaning that we can compute
the entire population (five times 300,000, not that we needed to know the
exact figure). The 141,000 Buddhists make up 30% of City Y, meaning that we
can compute the entire population of City Y as well.

2.  (E)  This is a causal argument. According to the experts, high prime-time
ratings cause the ratings of the evening news show to increase as well.
However, at Channel NTR, this was not found to be true. What conclusion can
we draw from this? The correct answer is choice (E), which asks us to
consider that there might be alternate causes. (A), (B), and (C) are outside
the scope of the argument, while choice (D) would have been more likely to be
correct had this been a statistical argument.
