In an effort to streamline the corporate center and in recognition of the
growing capabilities of Enron,s regional Wholesale Business, Global Asset
Operations will be reorganized effective 1 May 2000.  Our current Global
Asset Operations functions will be decentralized and become a business unit
responsibility.
Enron will continue to operate all of its facilities under standardized
guidelines and procedures and compliance will be monitored through a formal
audit program as in the past.  However, our Wholesale Business Units will
assume responsibility for operation and management of their specific power
plants and other assets.
Operational Energy Corporation (OEC) will become the Enron Corp &Center of
Excellence8 for power plant operations.  The Gas Pipeline Group is the Center
of Excellence8 for pipeline operations.  OEC will reside in Enron North
America.  Jim Noles will be in charge of this activity.  Mark Dobler will
lead operations; and John Cates will lead the Development Support Activity.
John Cates, organization will continue to provide O&M estimates and due
diligence assistance to business units.  John will specifically approve O&M
estimates for corporate risk assessment decisions.  Jim Noles and this new
group will report to the Office of the Chairman in Enron North America.
The Quality Management Group (Audit Function) will be assigned to the Gas
Pipeline Group (GPG).  Don Hawkins will continue to head Quality Management
and will report to Phil Lowry, Managing Director, Operations, GPG. In
addition to managing the global audit program, Don will continue his
responsibility for standardized policies and procedures, the Crisis
Management Program, ISO 9000 certification, the Positive Impact Program,
operational reporting, and the Asset Operations Website.
The Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) Group led by Henry Van will report
to Mike Terraso, Enron,s Chief Environmental Officer reporting to Steve
Kean.  As in the past, Henry,s Group will continue to provide environmental
and safety support to the regional business units.
Enron,s Wholesale Business Unit,s can now choose from a variety of services
provided by OEC.  These include full turnkey O&M services, O&M estimates, due
diligence, and technical support for planned and forced outages.  Business
units are encouraged to take advantage of these services as they operate and
maintain the power plants in their businesses.
Kurt Huneke will help transition the Asset Operations activity as discussed
herein, while dedicating his full attention to Enron Wind Company as its
Chairman and CEO.
Please join us in wishing these groups success.
