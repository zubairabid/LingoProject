SUMMARY

A task force of staff members from the Commodity Futures
Trading
Commission (the "CFTC") issued a report in late February that recommends ways
to modernize the regulation of exchange and electronic trading of
derivatives.  The
report, entitled A New Regulatory Framework (the "Report"), proposes a
significant
restructuring of the CFTC's regulatory responsibilities in an effort to
provide markets
with flexibility to respond to  technological and competitive challenges.  In
particular,
the task force recommends the adoption of a three-tiered regulatory framework
for
derivatives exchanges and other trading facilities that are or may be within
the CFTC's
jurisdiction.  This framework would establish differing levels of oversight
depending on
the nature of the commodities traded and the sophistication of the market
participants.
The Report also proposes that the CFTC regulate the markets and entities that
it oversees
based on flexible "core regulatory principles" rather than prescriptive,
technical rules.
