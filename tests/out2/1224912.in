John had asked that I re-examine the issue of closure of Daesan port in
relation to a possible claim against Hyundai.

Below is the e-mail received from Jung-ah of our Korean office which I
forwarded to WFW to comment. WFW has reverted to say that their opinion that
we do not have an action against Hyundai does not change. I will forward
their response separately.
