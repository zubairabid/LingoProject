I have scheduled a call at 10:00 Houston time on Monday to talk with ICF
about a new curve for LV, Pastoria, Louisiana, Florida and Missouri.  They
have said that they can get a preliminary curve to us within 3-5 days with a
full market study to follow.  For this, they have ask for $95M.  They usually
charge $37,500 per region, and usually give us a 12% discount for a total of
$33,000.  So in their minds, they are shaving off $70M from the standard
discounted price.

Let's talk before the call if at all possible. We need to be in a position to
give them the go ahead on Monday, if we are comfortable with the proposal.
Otherwise, we risk not getting the results until the following week.

Thanks,

Don
