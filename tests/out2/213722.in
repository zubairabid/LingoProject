Seabron --

Here is a paper Brattle is putting together for Enron in Japan.  See Section
5 - A Japanese Pool.  They make several good arguments as to why a mandatory
pool with financial settlements around the pool is key for Japanese
liberalization.   Maybe steal some of their ideas for our US policy arguments.
