Jeff, my understanding is that, various level of emergencies are declared by
the CAISO because of power supply situations.   Rotating outage plans are
then required to be implemented by the Utilities in order to reduce their
power supply requirements (i.e. electric loads).   The utilities chose to
implement their Rotating Outage Plans by dropping various distribution
circuits, that do not have essential customers connected to them, on a
rotating basis because it is cheap and easy to implement, less controversial,
and less politically sensitive.
The following are my comments:
My main concern is with regards to the way they propose to handle Direct
Access customers.   Direct Access customers should not be included in PG&E's
Mandatory Curtailment Plan (MCP) because the power that these customers are
using is not coming from PG&E anymore.   Their power supply requirements are
being met by their ESP's.
PG&E's proposal is treating transmission level customers like utilities.
The only difference, this time, is that PG&E is acting like the regulator
(controlling the customer).
At a minimum, the cost of implementing their proposal should be paid for by
PG&E and not the transmission customers.
Non-firm customers, such as IBM, should not be included or be required to
participate in their MCP anymore because their loads are dropped down to the
minimum or essential levels, by the CAISO first, even before a state of
emergency is declared.   There is a minimum load level that facilities
require in order to maintain human and environmental safety conditions.
Please give me a call if you have any question.
Thanks
