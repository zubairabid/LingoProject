To All:

Attached is a credit worksheet to amend the ISDA with Engage Energy Canada
and Enron Canada.  Engage Energy Canada has a new Guarantor with respect to
their ISDA contract so the appropriate changes need to be made to the ISDA.
This includes the receipt of an executed guaranty from the new Guarantor.

The current guaranty is provided for both Engage US and Engage Canada for
their prospective ISDA's, so in order to keep things consistent one new
guaranty should be received covering both entities.  A credit worksheet to
amend Engage US was sent up to the legal group April 21.

Thank you,

Russell
