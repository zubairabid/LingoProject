Let me try and clear this up.  Based on the email thread, a conference call
on the 14th is favored.  Since Bill McCoy is speaking at the NYC brown bag,
my suggestion is to set up the conference call with the parties you
identified for after the brown bag, which would be sometime after 2pm NY
time.  I have a call in to Michael Shenberg at Strook, Strook & Lavan to see
if it would be ok for Bill Fritz, (he's going to lunch) and I to stay at
their offices for the call.  Otherwise we'd go somewhere else.  I would set
up the call through our service.  ok?

On another note.  We will find out on the 11th what Southern wants to do for
the credit workshop in February (January is too early).  Because of turmoil
in the markets out west, Randy has now asked me to draft a program.  Any
suggestions would be greatly appreciated.   Also, I am now going ahead and
planning to do a California workshop for April 20th that would precede the
EEI Legal Committee conference.
