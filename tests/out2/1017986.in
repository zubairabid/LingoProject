What is the latest on the EOL feeds.  I talked to Dave last week and he
indicated it was no problem.  I have a meeting with him today at 2:30.  Let
me know what I need to tell him.  Also, what is the latest with the late
nominations.  I talked to Jason and he told him it was due to producers
changing their noms.  I have not talked to George about this issue.  Jason
also thinks that the problem is shorter lived that PGL&C has indicated.
Please write back with PGL&C's position on the matter.

Thanks
Hunter
