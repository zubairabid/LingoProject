Scott,

We have decided to alter the way in which we register people

We have decided to send out passwords to all counterparties this summer which
are Read Only and only when they return the PA signed do we alter the status
of  their password to execution status (subject to eveyone being happy with
this).

I would like to question the usefulness of the ROETA - why exactly do we need
it - I don't seem to be able to figure it out - I propose we get rid of it.
