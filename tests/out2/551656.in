lsu owns texas.  did we not beat you at basketball and baseball in their most
important collegiate tournaments?  why does everyone from ut think they have
such a storied program?  you haven't won in decades.  your current coach has
proved he can't win big games.  you guys will be ranked high (as you were
this year), but you won't hold that ranking.  texas has the easiest schedule
and they will manage to lose an early one as usual.  all i heard last year at
this time was that 2000 was supposed to be the year, but look how that turned
out.  you guys should be a little more competitive next year against ou.
good luck.
