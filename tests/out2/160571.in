Mona - we were just sorting through this with PGE Phase 2 and DG, with Roger,
Bruno and Jeff.   Questions are

is it sufficient to take on issues in those cases, or is there something to
gain by expanding to SDG&E?  (I thought this was a pretty small market)
lowering or even eliminating voltage differentials isn't by itself
anti-competitive (our VBUs may have just been taking advantage of an
irregularity in the previous rate design )  Do their new proposals have
legitimate cost-based differentials?  (I haven't seen them.)

I think we should roll this up with the PGE/DG discussion, figure out our
preferred policy position, and then see whether it merits any action.

Thanks.
