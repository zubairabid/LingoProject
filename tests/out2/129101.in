Hey Debra, we did an audit of all 'EOL approved" contracts in EOL Back-office
& while reviewing the data I told Stacey that I'd give her a list of all
Master contracts that were not in Enfolio II format. The spreadsheet attached
lists the contracts (33 total) along with their current Investment Grade
Status. We thought it might be worth while to look at the counterparties &
determine where we might want to replace the old version contracts with new
Enfolios (especially with the potential trade volume out on EOL). This was
not stated to be a 'hot item', but with the potential exposure on EOL it was
deemed worth a look over.

Bet this made your day huh?

Thanks!!
Cyndie
