Richard:

Kathy finished her questions at the end of the day yesterday. Her approach
was very helpful to Enron, and also PaineWebber, even to the point of
skipping pages in documents that referred to either of them. Enron's name
was mentioned probably three or four times in three days (and then only in
questions, not in answers).

Kathy's themes were:

1. At the time of the offering, portions of the hot mill were
incomplete, and the hot mill was not really operating.

2. The design of the cold mill was flawed.

3. The role of SDI in the managment of NSM was greatly exaggerated
in the offering presentations. [Kathy did not seem to be be saying (as other
have) that the role of the Management Co. was exaggerated.]

4. Nucor was really Stickler's first choice for SDI's role, but
Nucor pulled out becasue of substantive concerns, e.g., flawed design of cold
mill. Stickler lied when he told others that Nucor just wanted too much
money. (Based on what I have seen so far, I don't think we know yet why
Stickler and Nucor did not make a deal.)

5. By late April 1998, if not before, NSM managment and directors
knew that the projections in the offering materials were way off, as NSM's
own internal budget was much different. (Roland and I showed you these
documents when we were last in Houston.) A substantial portion of the
offering funds were still in trust at this time (how much???), and the
bondholders should have been told (when they could still pull back some of
their money if they wanted to) that the projections on which they had
invesfted were not correct. [If this argument were developed and had legal
merit, it could hurt Enron, as its affiliates or employees were (a) "initial
purchasers" in the offering, (b) a member of the management co., and (c) a
member of the NSM board.]

Kathy was never clear in her questioning whether she regarded SDI as
a defrauder or a defraudee. At times she seemed to be saying that SDI knew
bad things about NSM and the mill and concealed them or permitted others to
lie about them. At other times she seemed to be inviting Busse to say that
he was lied to.

There is no question that Kathy regards David Stickler as the number
one bad guy and David Wheeler (NatWest) as number two.

Busse's principal themes were: (1) SDI agreed only to a very limited
role; (2) all of the problems were soluble IF NSM had good management. NSM
turned out to have terrible managment. Busse and everyone else were lied to
about that, and that is why NSM failed.

I had not realized before this week that, by the time of the closing,
the Management Co. had only 3 members (SDI and affiliates of McDonald and
Enron.) [Stickler was appointed manager of the Management Co.] If Enron has
a problem in this case, it will likely arise out of the combination of
enron's two roles--i.e., involved in the offering itself and then in the
follow on management of NSM.

I suggest that, if I can't make progress with Hirschmann next week,
we (Milbank) notice and take Legg-Mason's deposition (assuming that the other
defendants agree--and maybe even if they don't.) It's time to stop letting
Legg Mason have a free ride.
