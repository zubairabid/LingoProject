Sorry to hear about your airport travels.  Has Alejandra found a place to
live yet?  When is she starting on the east desk...they need help!!  They
screwed their position up again today.

My weekend was really good.  Of course it could have been better without the
rain.  Saturday my friend and I sat around and gossiped most of the afternoon
and then went out to eat and to a movie.  Then Sunday we went to visit some
friends of ours in Sugarland that just had a baby.  So we spent most of
Sunday afternoon playing with the baby.  The dad is hilarious.  He's the type
that seems really quite but when he says something he just cracks you up.  He
was talking about the baby monitors they got.  He said he was going to put a
message on it that said, "Hi, Brianna.  This is your parents.  We aren't
available right now, but it you leave a message we'll get back to you."

Are we having Spanish class today?
