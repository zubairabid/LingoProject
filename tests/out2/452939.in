COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

Power/Gas/Emissions Markets -- California Energy Crisis & Emissions
Regulation -  Mary Schoen has been working out of the San Francisco office,
providing analysis and develop strategy on the environmental components of
the many bills that are being introduced in the California legislature to fix
the energy crisis.  Enron's primary strategy is to drive the permitting
process and air requirements to a more standardized, centralized format and
to allow generators to pay into a pollution mitigation fund in lieu of
purchasing/creating air quality offsets.   Stacey Bolton informed EES of
opportunities in legislation that could allow energy efficiency projects to
qualify as early reduction credits to meet air quality regulations.  All ESG
members continue to provide business units with information and updates on a
daily basis regarding potential legislative/regulatory changes that could
affect key Enron markets in California.

Power Generation -- EES Locomotive project - Mary Schoen provided guidance
along with Gus Eghneim, on the air quality and permitting issues surrounding
EES's locomotive project.   Worked with consultants to produce a matrix of
the state-by-state requirements and analysis of a potential loophole in the
rules which may allow these engines to permitted as mobile sources and avoid
stringent requirements.

EES's Premium Power Group on permitting and siting fuel cells in CA and TX.

Power Generation/Origination - Mary Schoen is providing intelligence to 2 new
commercial groups -- a power origination group looking at new coal generation

technical legislative drafting and lobbying on the multi-pollutant bill.

Energy Efficiency/Air Quality -  air quality regulatory requirements, which
would benefit EES.
Indiana NOx SIP:   Mary Schoen scored a major victory in Indiana's NOx SIP,
where regulators included Enron's suggestion for a 2% set aside of NOx
allowances for energy efficiency/renewable energy projects.
"Negawatt" programs:  Stacey Bolton worked with EES on comments suggesting
changes to the structure of the Negawatt program in Pennsylvania.  Stacey is
also promoting the Negawatt concept in Ohio.   Stacey also is pursuing the
inclusion of energy efficiency credits such as Negawatts in California
legislation aimed at assisting the energy crisis.

Power group as they develop and implement their business plan to provide
power quality and distributed generation services to customers in the
high-tech area.  Stacey Bolton met with EES regarding a fuel cell
demonstration project in California, and developed strategies for assisting
them with state/federal funding.   Stacey drafted an abstract for EES'
application for a CARB grant, which has the potential to provide EES with $1
million in funding.   Mary Schoen attended a hearing at CARB focused on
certifying DG technologies and providing guidance to local permitters to
accelerate the permitting of DG.   Jeff Keeler worked on coordinating
signatures of an industry letter (which EES signed) to DOE urging development
of an FY 02 multi-million dollar funding mechanism at DOE to support R&D and
commercial applications for power quality projects in the high-tech sector.

Renewable Energy - California Crisis and Retail Green Power markets -  Stacey
Bolton worked with EES regarding the regulatory implications for their green
customers in PG&E's territory which are being switched from a physical to
financial contract.  Stacey helped coordinate with Harold Buchanan and his
sales representatives to inform customers Patagonia and Fetzer that EES would
be supplying them with a green tag product rather than 100% (physical) green
power.   Stacey worked with PR on a strategy to position our green tag
efforts as environmentally-friendly, and market oriented solutions to
California's crisis.  Stacey spoke with both the CEC and Green-e to ensure
that EES' labeling and certification would not be affected, and informed of
the positive responses she received. Stacey also explored the possibility of
getting customer credit money for a tag-only product.

Environmental Disclosure:
Ohio - Stacey met with Ohio PUC staff regarding environmental disclosure
programs and clarify EES' arrangement with First Energy, where First Energy
would file the actual label with customers.  Stacey was also asked to sit on
the Ohio Green-e advisory group to develop a standard for certification in
Ohio, where she is promoting market-oriented solutions.
California -  Stacey reminded EES about upcoming reporting deadlines for the
California CEC and Green-e (March 1) and routed the appropriate worksheets to
EES legal.

affairs and ETS on advocacy efforts regarding pipeline safety legislation.

every 5 years with three exceptions -- unavailability of equipment; other
appropriate technical means exist; or necessary supply may be interrupted.
Jeff provided political/strategic assistance based on last year's legislative
experience.
