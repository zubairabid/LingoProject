By now, most of you are aware that Enron will be acquiring London-based MG
Plc, one of the world,s leading metals marketers.  In connection with our
on-going activities relating to MG Plc, I thought it would be helpful to
provide you with a brief overview of on our future new metals business, to
further explain the reasons underlying the acquisition and to update you on
the integration team,s accomplishments to date.

What is MG Plc?
MG Plc is a leading, independent international metals trading business, which
provides a variety of services to the global metals industry. The business
dates back to 1881 when it was the German Metallgesellschaft Group and was
active in trading metals from its head office in Frankfurt.  Today, MG is one
of the world,s top non-ferrous metals brokers and market makers, the world,s
leading independent copper merchant and a leading merchant of many other
non-ferrous metals.

MG is comprised of two core areas of expertise, the Financial Services and
Merchanting Divisions.  The Financial Services Division was formed in 1970 to
provide market-making and trading services to the MG,s physical metals
trading business through futures trading as a member of the London Metal
Exchange and, at a later date, as a member of COMEX in New York.  In the late
1980s, as a result of London,s growing leading role in the metals industry,
MG established a merchant trading office in London.  In 1986, MG developed
its warehousing division with the acquisition of Henry Bath.  In 1999, the
Merchanting and Financial Services Divisions, including warehousing, were
combined into a single company, which was floated on the London Stock
Exchange.  Currently, MG,s core trading offices are located in London and New
York with warehouse operations in Liverpool, Humberside, Rotterdam, New
Orleans, New Haven, and Singapore. It has merchanting offices in Lima,
Santiago, Los Angeles, Chicago, Stockholm, Cologne, Hamburg, Frankfurt, New
Delhi, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong, Seoul, Tokyo and Melbourne.

What does the Merchanting Division do?
The Merchanting Division is the world,s leading independent copper merchant,
one of the top three independent merchants of copper concentrates and nickel
and one of the leading European merchants of recycled non-ferrous metals. The
division also trades in other non-ferrous metals on the London Metals
Exchange (LME), including lead, tin, zinc, aluminium and brass.

The Merchanting Division engages in the following main activities:

Merchanting of Non-ferrous Metals ) MG trades as a principal with producers
and consumers, buying and selling non-ferrous metals and concentrates
(particularly copper, aluminium and nickel), exchanging qualities and
locations and lending and borrowing metals.
Global Stockholding ) MG holds stocks of non-ferrous metals at warehouses
around the world.
Merchanting of Recycled Metal ) MG trades as a principal with suppliers and
consumers of non-ferrous metal for recycling.
Terminal Market Operations ) MG participates in the LME and COMEX using
hedging, arbitrage and position management to support its merchanting
activity.

What does the Financial Services Division do?
The Financial Services Division is one of the leading LME members and, based
on the volume of LME metals stored, is one of the leading LME metals
warehousing businesses.

The Financial Services Division engages in the following main activities:

Brokerage Activities ) MG executes orders as a broker for clients in LME
and COMEX contracts.
Market-Making ) MG is a market-maker for both futures and options contracts
and COMEX and OTC contracts.
Warehousing ) MG stores metals and other goods in eleven locations in
Europe, the United States and Asia.

MG has also begun to prepare to trade non-ferrous metals using the internet
as its platform.  On 10th February, MG announced the formation of a joint
venture with Internet Capital Group, Inc. and Safeguard International Fund,
L.P. to develop an internet marketplace for trading non-ferrous metals. The
joint venture, called EMETRA, intends to establish a world-wide
business-to-business, e-commerce trading platform for the non-ferrous metals
markets, including physical trading and the trading of futures and options
contracts.

Why is Enron acquiring MG?
Enron is committed to expanding its position as a global leader in wholesale
markets. By expanding into new wholesale markets, such as non-ferrous metals,
Enron expects to leverage its wholesale expertise and will be able to offer
customers new products and solutions to address their business needs which
link different commodities and inputs.

MG will provide Enron with a number of important benefits.  At the same time,
Enron expects that MG will significantly benefit from its association with
Enron.  Some of the benefits we envisage include:

The opportunity to combine Enron,s core competencies in trading, finance
and origination with MG,s global position in trading non-ferrous metals.

The ability for both Enron and MG to access new clients, particularly in
the United States and Europe.

The ability to cross-market both existing products and new products such as
bundled products that offer combined metals and power outsourcing.

The ability to leverage the opportunities available to MG by increasing its
financial strength and the resources available to it.

The chance to overlay the EnronOnline business-model on the metals industry
to increase liquidity and contract market share.

What remains to be done?
Merging the business operations of two entities, even highly motivated
companies such as Enron and MG, has been and will continue to be a formidable
and daunting exercise.  Having a shared vision facilitates rapid integration,
but there are many complicated and complex tasks that remain.  During the
conditional offer period, Enron and MG are taking steps to prepare for a
seamless and non-disruptive integration of our respective operations.
Ideally, when Enron,s offer to buy all MG shares becomes unconditional (15
July 2000 is the current target date), the two can hit the ground with their
feet running.

In the short term, a number of things must be accomplished to facilitate that
smooth transition.  Most importantly, in order to ensure that the deal goes
forward, Enron and MG will work to remove the remaining conditions to Enron,s
offer, including obtaining the shareholder approvals from all shareholders as
well as obtaining relevant regulatory consents.

A number of other steps must be taken, however, during the first phase of our
integration timetable to ensure that everything stays on track.  Integration
activities will focus on four primary aspects of our operations: commercial
matters, financial matters, middle and back office issues; and, most
importantly, on the employees of both organisations.  Some of the most
important goals relating to each of these areas are:

Commercial
Developing physical metal contracts suitable for listing on EnronOnline and
installing necessary communication and technology links to facilitate data
transfers and information flows between MG and Enron.
Preparing a joint venture management plan for MG's interest in EMETRA that
is consistent with Enron,s goal of listing physical metal contracts on
EnronOnline.
Identifying opportunities to
- combine Enron's core competencies in trading, finance, and origination with
MG's global position in trading non-ferrous metals;
- leverage MG,s position by increasing its financial strength and resources
available to it;
- cross-market both existing and new products to Enron and MG customers,
particularly in the US and Europe; and
- grow MG's metal trading franchise.

Financial
Obtaining waivers from MG's banks in respect of change of control in loan
or other agreements.
Preparing plans to integrate cash management functions and putting in place
funding arrangements for August 2000 onwards.
Preparing plans to arrange large-scale inventory securitisation to reduce
balance sheet debt before year-end.

Middle and Back Office
Preparing financial information necessary to understand and maximise
integration benefits including, pro-forma consolidated financial statements;
profit and loss budgets for the third and fourth quarters of 2000; and
integration budgets.
Determining the feasibility of integrating accounting systems (AS400, SAP).
Assessing  MG's core trading and risk profiles and developing plans to
incorporate risk profiles in MG's metals books into Enron systems.
Evaluating IT systems and infra-structure at all MG office + warehouse
locations and preparing budgets and programmes to provide MG staff with
access to Enron IT systems and applications.

People
Preparing a programme to co-locate MG's London staff (145) at Enron House
over the weekend of 16/17 September.
Developing plans to harmonize compensation, benefits, and employment
policies and practices; developing plans for staff reporting relationships.
Communicating plans and status of activities at all levels of Enron's and
MG's organizations.
Arranging introductions between Enron and MG staff and providing
opportunities for information exchanges.

Where do we go from here?
I believe that Enron,s acquisition of MG is an exciting opportunity for us
all.  While a number of steps remain to be taken, we have already
successfully begun the integration of Enron and MG.  By remaining
enthusiastic and committed to this process, I expect that this transition
will proceed smoothly and with a minimum of difficulty.
