Thanks for reminding us of their policy regarding erroneous trades.  I copied
you on an email to their sales rep suggesting that this change.   While we
are likely to trade less actively (and more carefully) if we are dependent on
the other counterparty to break erroneous trades, we would still like to
begin using this site.
Therefore, please proceed with your plans to conclude legal discussions.
Thanks.
