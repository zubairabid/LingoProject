Gentlemen--here is the revised draft of the all-employee memo that we could
send from the Office of the Chairman.  Since Diomedes and David aren't
pushing this, I'd rather just keep it in reserve right now rather than keep
it moving.  (I am not sending this latest version to them.)  Mark, for your
info I am including the version that Diomedes and I have tentatively agreed
on that he would send to his region as well.
I am getting mixed signals on NoCal.  Michael Miller says he is still working
on their IM, yet today Frank Stabler said that he doesn't want the news clips
any more due to their "change in status".  What does this mean?
