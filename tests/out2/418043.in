With respect to the attached list, a few things:
1.  With respect to Dynegy Power Marketing, my records reflect that they are
approved for all products (including financial & power).  Can you let me know
if your approvals reflect otherwise?
2.  With respect to Nicor Gas Company and Northern Illinois Gas Company:
Northern Illinois Gas Company should be restyled to be "Northern Illinois Gas
Company d/b/a Nicor Gas Company".  We have just received the executed ISDA
Master with this entity and that is how the counterparty directed us to set
the master up.  Nicor Gas Company appears to be their physical gas trading
arm, so that entity name should be left alone.
I haven't forgotten the 8/11/00 list, I am waiting to hear back from
Australia about a question.
