I spoke with Peggy's office ( she will not be in until right before the
meeting), and the fees within the Enron group that might apply to us are as
follows:\

EOG:  Directors:  flat retainer of $8,750/quarter ( no per meeting/attendance
fee)
Each Chairman of a committee received an additional  flat $2,500 retainer
for their service

Northern Border:  No outside Directors that are paid by Enron:
Audit Committee receives flat retainer of $3,750, and $1,000/meeting.

She is going to check further to see if anyone has any additional input as to
a norm.  I will let you know and will talk to Peggy further also this
afternoon.
