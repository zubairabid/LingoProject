David:
As we discussed, this CP is expecting to receive a revised NDA to replace the
form we previously sent to them.  Accordingly, I will have Tana prepare a new
form of NDA, which I will modify a bit to incorporate their proposed
revisions to the previous draft to the extent they are acceptable, and send a
revised draft to the counterparty.
With regard to the MOU, I have left Dennis a voice mail explaining that I do
not feel comfortable picking up an MOU in the middle of negotiations.  I do
not agree that it needs to be the same lawyer drafting the MOU and the NDA
and intend to discuss this issue with him.
I have briefly discussed the general issue of our involvement in the
representation of EnronCredit.com with Mark Taylor and will follow up with
some more helpful guidelines next week.  In the meantime, I'll work on the
ERisk NDA.
Regards,
