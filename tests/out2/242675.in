I am copying Sara on this b/c I would be interested in her input if she has a
different take than I do.
I understand your message to mean that P&G is offering a representation from
them that they will strictly adhere to their corporate derivatives policy
(with a copy of the policy attached to the contract), and, in exchange for
this, they would like the "No Reliance" representation deleted entirely.
I don't really see how such a representation helps us with the "No Reliance"
problem.   The CFTC has ruled that in a dealer/customer context, if the
customer relies on the dealer's expertise in entering into a trade, then the
trade may be unenforceable against the customer.  The legal principle is one
of fiduciary duty and doesn't really have anything to do with corporate
authorization.  In other words, the fact that the trade is authorized does
not change the fact that the customer is relying on the dealer's superior
knowledge.
In its 1996 lawsuit with Bankers Trust, Procter & Gamble unwound an interest
rate swap position when they ended up about $200 million out of the money.
P&G argued that they were relying on BT due to BT's superior expertise in
interest rate markets, and therefore P&G shouldn't have to pay.  The issue of
whether or not P&G was authorized to enter into the swaps was not an issue at
all in that case, nor would it be an issue, in my opinion, if P&G sought to
unwind a pulp and paper swap with us based on our alleged superior expertise
in pulp and paper markets.
The danger of having positions unwound has made the "No Reliance" clause one
of the most important clauses in the ISDA for us.  I will look at and
consider any particular language they may wish to propose, but conceptually,
we can not trade with counterparties who wish to rely on our market expertise
in deciding whether to enter into a trade. -- Bob
