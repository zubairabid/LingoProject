St. Francis Episcopal Day School in Houston, Texas was founded in 1952 in
response to the needs of the St. Francis Episcopal Church and the surrounding
neighborhood. Currently, the school serves students from the age of three
through the eighth grade. St. Francis is accredited by both the Independent
Schools Association of the Southwest and the Southwestern Association of
Episcopal Schools and is a member of the National Association of Independent
Schools. Our mission is supported through the efforts of our Board of
Trustees, Head of School, school leadership team, faculty, staff, parents,
student body, and friends of St. Francis.
The school's mission statement is: "In the Anglican tradition, St. Francis
Episcopal Day School challenges motivated students in an academically and
spiritually stimulating environment to become imaginative, critical thinkers,
and people for others."
Our curriculum is the result of intense work by the talented educators at St.
Francis. We are dedicated to providing a well-rounded, value-centered program
that balances stimulating academics with experiences that broaden students'
knowledge of themselves and today's world.
The Early Childhood division is organized in learning centers that include
activities with challenging materials and experiences. The classroom becomes
a laboratory where children can explore and experiment. The enrichment
program in early childhood includes experiences with music, motor
development, Spanish, and technology. Our full day kindergarten program
allows children and teachers to explore topics thoroughly. They begin the
nationally recognized Everyday Mathematics, a program rich in problem solving
activities.
The lower school curriculum provides young learners with a carefully planned,
sequential course of study that includes Reader's and Writer's Workshop,
Everyday Mathematics, "hands-on" science, and integrated social studies.
Specialists teach art, music, physical education, and Spanish. Small class
sizes contribute to the success of each child.
The Middle School seeks to celebrate the uniqueness of early adolescence.
After completing three years in middle school, students can anticipate being
admitted to quality high school programs, both public and private, and enjoy
the confidence that develops from proper preparation - academically,
socially, and morally. By the end of their eighth grade year, students will
have had the opportunity to receive high school credit for Algebra I,
physical science, and Spanish I.
Through conferences, professional organizations, workshops, graduate studies,
book clubs, and extensive travel, the men and women who teach at St. Francis
know the current research on how children best learn and use this knowledge
in the classroom. The tradition of an Anglican education coupled with an
energetic expert staff makes magic happen both within the classroom and
throughout our campus.
St. Francis is committed to providing students with an up-to-date technology
enhanced educational experience. We currently have six staff members
supporting technology and one staff member leading curriculum development on
our campus. Our faculty presented a workshop on using technology in the
classroom at the prestigious Association for Supervision and Curriculum
Development 1997-1998 Conference. Technology at St. Francis is a tool going
beyond computer literacy by incorporating lessons using technological support
in every subject for every student. Students are active participants in
searching for knowledge using the Internet, print, and other electronic
sources. They learn to retrieve and use information to complete projects and
assignments. Each classroom is Internet ready. Along with access to grade
level mini-labs and classroom computers, students have the use of two
high-level multimedia labs containing scanners, digital cameras, video
capabilities, and color laser printers. Teachers and students use technology
as a problem solving, communication, and research tool to enhance an already
rich learning experience. Students use real world technology to present their
information to a wide audience.
St. Francis offers many exciting opportunities for students to involve
themselves in the fine arts. Through the music, drama, and art programs, our
students learn the values of discipline, perseverance, and commitment, and
the joy of performing in front of a live audience. With strings, choir, band,
drama club, and studio art, students have opportunities to explore their own
creativity and interests while being trained by talented artists and
musicians.
Along with art in classroom instruction and after school clubs, St. Francis
is extremely proud to offer our students Art a la Carte. This innovative
program enhances the art and social studies curriculum by bringing teams of
trained volunteers into the classroom to help the students learn to
appreciate great art. Costumes, props, food, and other enhancements are
frequently part of the lessons at all grade levels. This integration of art
production and art history makes our art program truly unique!
Being an athlete at St. Francis Episcopal Day School and playing for the
Wolves are privileges and honors that carry many responsibilities. Middle
school students may sign up for three sports a year, one each in the fall,
winter and spring. They may choose football, cross-country, field hockey,
volleyball, wrestling, soccer, basketball, softball and track. Sixth graders
do not participate in football. Coaches stress the importance of teamwork,
peer relationships, cooperation, discipline, and a healthy body.
The Classroom of the Earth is an extraordinary program that extends the
classroom walls and allows the students to apply learning in a natural
setting. Starting with the beginner class, it combines curriculum study with
outdoor awareness and provides the ultimate in critical thinking
opportunities and application of problem solving strategies. The program
culminates with an eighth grade trip to Bandelier National Monument near
Santa Fe, New Mexico. While there, students visit Tsankawi ruins, study the
Anasazi culture, and document their trip with lively updates and pictures on
our website. St. Francis alumni often report that some of their fondest
memories are of COE trips. Classroom of the Earth trips are lead by faculty
members and teachers trained through both the National Outdoor Leadership
School and the Wilderness First Responder Course.
St. Francis is proud of its rich religious traditions including the Feast of
St. Francis, the Blessing of the Animals, celebration of the church seasons,
Episcopal School Sunday, and birthday blessings. Students worship together
twice weekly. Third through eighth graders join together monthly to celebrate
the Holy Eucharist. Students participate in chapel by reading prayers and
scripture and serving as acolytes and crucifers. The chaplain of the school
organizes the worship services. He is available to school families as a
pastor and friend. We invite parents, friends and relatives to worship with
us at any of our services. Religious education is an integral part of the
curriculum from age three through eighth grade. Through study, discussion,
and experiences, students internalize values and develop character to live a
godly life and be of service to others.
St. Francis is committed to outreach and service. It is our goal that each
student understands that he or she has something unique and special to offer
to the world. By teaching our students to be people for others, they leave
our school with a deeper understanding of community and the concept of giving
of themselves. Together, St. Francis Episcopal Day School, St. Francis
Episcopal Church, the St. Francis Children's Center, and the St. Francis
Sports Association commit to nurturing the spiritual, educational, emotional
and physical development of all God's people. These four entities form the
St. Francis Community, a unique gathering of energy, individuals and ideals.
