Mike,

I agree with your assessment on keeping tabs on them but currently I don't
see any real opportunity or decision to spend time or money with this
effort.  I have received feedback from others in the group as well and they
agree with our general thinking.  Have you talked with Louise lately?  We are
announcing today that we will be pushing our pricing to other platforms in
the US (therefore we keep all the liquidity of their markets).  Maybe this
will apply to these guys, someday.  Certainly it is not appropriate now and
with your domination concerns it might scare them even more.

My time is very limited next week and I am double booked most of the time.
I'm out Wed - Sunday and then the analyst meetings begin after that.  I
really don't have time to meet with them especially if there is not real deal
pending.  Is there someone else that is more appropriate, maybe someone can
take them through EOL?  If you like that, please call Louise and co-ordinate.

Thanks,
Mike
