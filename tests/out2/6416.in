Jeff,

Seth Spalding here, director of research at epoch partners. We met via
satellite this january when you presented at CE unterberg towbins conference
in New York. I have since moved from ceut to epoch partners. In any case, I
ran across a company, backed by bill tai at redpoint ventures, that has some
excellent distributed IP technology used to bring SS7 like functionality to
IP networks. I thought you or someone at enron might be interested in
speaking with them in light of your bandwidth exchange plans. The company is
called eyefrog, and has nothing of depth available on their website. If this
would be of interest to you, please let me know and I would be happy to put
you in touch.
Regards,
Seth Spalding
