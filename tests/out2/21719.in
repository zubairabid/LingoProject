Lilly and Generex Sign Agreement To Develop
Buccal Form of Insulin
Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE: LLY) and Generex Biotechnology Corporation
(NASDAQ: GNBT) today announced that they have signed an agreement to
develop a buccal formulation of insulin that is administered as a fine
spray into the oral cavity using Generex proprietary technology.
Under the terms of the agreement, Generex will receive certain initial fees
and milestone payments.  Generex will also receive royalty payments based
on product sales.  In exchange, Lilly will receive exclusive worldwide
rights to products resulting from the collaboration.  Lilly will be
responsible for conducting clinical trials, securing regulatory approvals
and marketing on a worldwide basis.  Clinical trials of the first product
candidate are under way in North America and Europe.  Lilly will also have
the option to develop a number of additional products depending on the
success of the initial product.
"We look forward to working with Generex, whose buccal spray delivery
technology potentially represents a novel approach to drug delivery," said
James A. Harper, president, diabetes and growth disorders products for
Lilly. "A buccal spray formulation of insulin could provide an attractive
alternative for people with diabetes."
"The opportunity to partner with Lilly, the global leader in insulins, to
develop the world's first marketed buccal insulin spray represents very
good news for millions of patients with diabetes throughout the world,"
said Anna Gluskin, chief executive officer of Generex. "We are pleased that
Lilly has recognized the potential of buccal delivery of insulin and
Generex's RapidMist? technology for systemic delivery of proteins, peptides
and other large molecule drugs."
Today, worldwide costs for treating diabetes and its complications are
estimated to exceed $200 billion annually.  It is also estimated that, over
the next decade, the number of people with this disease will more than
double.  Lilly has been a leader in diabetes care for more than 75 years.
The company continues to aggressively pursue the goal of being a complete
diabetes care company and intends to provide innovative products to treat
all types and stages of diabetes.
Generex is engaged in the research and development of drug delivery systems
and technologies. To date, it has focused on developing a platform
technology for the buccal delivery (absorption through the inner cheek
walls) of large molecule drugs which, historically, have been administered
only by injection. Additional information about Generex can be found at
www.generex.com.
Lilly, a leading innovation-driven corporation, is developing a growing
portfolio of best-in-class pharmaceutical products by applying the latest
research from its own worldwide laboratories and from collaborations with
eminent scientific organizations. Headquartered in Indianapolis, Ind.,
Lilly provides answers ? through medicines and information ? for some of
