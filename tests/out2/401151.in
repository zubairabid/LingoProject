While I recognize the sensitivity of CCC and Dynegy, et al, to the problems
created by their previous signatures to the Interim settlement, I believe
the term section of the Interim settlement could reasonably be interpreted
to indicate that no other change of consequence, specifically:
Provisions that the Commission agrees not to require
SoCalGas to implement prior to January 1, 2003 include, but are not limited
to, the following:  the establishment of a system of firm, tradable rights
in SoCalGas' intrastate transmission capacity and/or receipt point capacity
that would necessitate or create the likelihood of either rate design
changes or cost shifts between customer classes; the unbundling of the cost
of SoCalGas' intrastate transmission system; the institution of full-time
daily balancing for transportation service; any further unbundling of
storage costs; the implementation of shareholder risk for storage different
than the options provided in Section VII. of this Settlement;
I therefore would be hesitant to indicate that they do not oppose any
provision of the Interim settlement.  This is kind of sticky, but we have to
be careful how we word things...
