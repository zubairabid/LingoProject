Breaking News: CA Governor Declares State of Emergency
posted 2:37 AM (CST) Jan 18, 2001
Late Wednesday following a day of rolling blackouts and the prospect for more
with electricity supplies drying up throughout the West, California Gov. Gray
Davis declared a state of emergency due to the power shortage and directed
the state water resources department to begin securing power supplies for the
beleaguered state grid. In making the bold move, Gov. Davis also announced
that his conservation plan for state facilities and operations already has
reached its goal of reducing energy use by more than 5%.
In the emergency proclamation, the governor said that electricity presently
available through California three major investor-owned utilities is
"insufficient to prevent widespread and prolonged disruptions of electric
service," and thus, he was ordering all state agencies to use their resources
to do whatever they can to alleviate the power shortage. Then he went on to
specifically empower the water resources agency, which has been a key player
in helping the state's transmission grid operator (Cal-ISO) narrowly avoid
blackouts or avoid them being felt more pervasively throughout the state.
Noting that peak electrical loads for state buildings and institutions are on
target for a 200 MW reduction and the water resources department peak pumping
load has been reduced by 450 MW, Gov. Davis lauded Californians for having
"stepped up to the plate and dramatically reduced their appetite for
electricity," noting that the state already is 47th in the nation among the
lowest per-capita energy use and the state's electricity prices are the 10th
highest in the nation.
