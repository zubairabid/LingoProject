THE FRIDAY BURRITO

"If you think nobody cares, try missing a couple of payments."

The bigger the missed payment, the more they care. And how we Californians
care about the potentially biggest missed payment of the Century (Hey, I can
say that now and be telling the truth.). John Yurkanin, COO of the PX was
telling me at the end of our phone conversation yesterday, "You know, Gary,
you might be the only friend I have left anymore." I informed John that if
my friendship was so prized, then he was in big trouble. A situation like
that rates 3.4 TPCs (Totally Pathetic Circumstance). But, hey, John, stick
with me, don't worry about a thing. We're going to get through this.

Now, let's take an inventory of this week's crises. There is the electric
shortage crisis. We entered the Stage 3 Alert zone Thursday afternoon, and
early this morning. There is the natural gas pay-as-you-burn crisis. Most of
you natural gas sellers have determined that PG&E might not be the secured
buyer they once were. There is the cash crisis. Our two major utilities have
no liquid funds to pay their energy bills. Mush all three crises together,
and you get a new word ( E-gash! Like our State Motto, Eureka, which means "
I have found it", we can exclaim "E-gash. I'm Screwed."

And everyone is starting to feel some of the pain. The ESPs, or what remains
of that class of market participants, were informed by PG&E that the payment
of the PX credit for the direct-access customer bills the ESPs are due under
consolidated billing are henceforth suspended. The rate freeze ended last
August, so, the logic goes, PG&E doesn't need to acknowledge the PX credit.
That puts a serious breach of contract kink in the ESP/Utility relationship.
Of course, who is going to write about hundreds of millions of dollars of
short payments when you can write about billions of dollars of short
payments. I mean, who cares about the financial well being of the remaining
competitors to the UDC's. Let them fold their tent. California customers
don't want a choice of energy provider, do they? I don't know. It's getting
too easy to be cynical.

Commissioner Carl Wood also handed out a couple of late Christmas gifts. He
ruled that QFs under Standard Offer Contracts could at most be paid
$67.45/MWH, regardless of the SO formula for energy payment. The QFs have to
buy winter-time natural gas at market prices, and their production costs are
easily in the range of +$200/MWH. What a great idea. Force 2,500 MW, or so,
of remaining SO-QF capacity to voluntarily shut down at a time when that
capacity is so desperately needed.

I know I have been picking on Mr. Wood a lot. This week we served on the
same FM radio talk show, KQED's Forum. I hate to admit this, but Carl is
really a nice person. I don't like disagreeing with people who are basically
decent. That's is why I would rather gently tease people like Mike Florio
rather than out-and-out disagree with him. I figure that deep inside these
misguided souls there is a crossed wire that gives them the wrong answer to
every major policy question. Carl and I started talking about good places to
get corned beef sandwiches as we were leaving the studio, and he was
positively effusive about some delicatessens he has frequented in Orange
County. I asked, "Carl, are you Jewish?" He said yes, that he grew up in a
Jewish section of Baltimore. "Carl," I confessed, "you don't look Jewish,
and you talk like a Communist. What's your story?" So we laughed about that
and chatted away as he walked to his car at the radio station parking lot,
and I walked to mine. I asked him, "Carl, what did you think of that Mark
Twain quote I used to dance on your 'Deregulation is Dead' statement, when I
said that rumors of deregulation's death have been greatly exaggerated?" He
replied, "From the moment I uttered those words on the dais of the PUC
hearing room, I feared someone was going to tag me with that Twain quote."
And it was I.

Nettie Hogue was the other panelist on the FM show. She spoke of the desire
for a core/non-core split of the default customers whereby the small
customers would be core, and the large customers would be non-core. The UDCs
would be required to procure for the core, but not for the non-core. The
larger customers, who have the ability and the resources could negotiate
long-term contracts with suppliers other than the UDC. If you take her
platform, and tweak it a little, you get something that looks very much like
our Morro Bay principle for releasing the greater than 100kW connected load
customers from UDC default service.

There is wrinkle in TURN's plan, however. They want to keep all the retained
generating assets (e.g., PG&E's hydro plants) for the core procurement
portfolio. I don't think the customers in the non-core group are going to
like that. They contributed revenue requirement to those retained plants,
too. They will want a credit for their contributions. On the other hand, if
PG&E and SCE were to transition to the core/non-core split, you can be
assured the Utility Company's will charge both core and non-core classes for
the carried stranded costs (the undercollection of revenue from today's
frozen rate debacle). The saw cuts both ways.

Speaking of saws, our Governor simply did one bang up job on the State of the
State message last Monday night. Now that I am a semi-professional talking
head (Give Us Quote), I was lined up by four news reporters prior to the
address to standby with my opinion on the Governor's speech. I was
diplomatic, sort of, to the press. Let me tell you what I really thought.
He stunk up the joint. I couldn't believe how nervous he was during the
delivery. I can understand a few slurred words, or a mispronunciation or
two. But Gray was grim. As he rock-and-rolled into the guts of his
comments, he sounded more and more like Mr. Rogers. Can you say, "Eminent
Domain"? He said at the outset that he wasn't going to assign blame or point
fingers. I was just a little hopeful that he would be conciliatory in tone.
Not. He ranted and raved for forty minutes, half of which was bashing you
folks for being, well, you folks. You are selling his power out of State.
What is wrong with you people? Portland based Avista's Linda Hamilton wrote
me a note, and as an aside asked, " ( quite entertaining--your governor.
Somehow I have yet to put together how he intends to solve the problem ". We
don't get it either, Linda. It is a mystery.

Okay, E-gash heads. Let's get it on.

@@@ PX has Writ all over it

The California PX did something that SCE couldn't do last week. That is,
they got a federal court to take notice on a Writ for a stay on aspects of
FERC's December 15 Order. The Writ asked the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals
