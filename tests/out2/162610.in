The Answer, My Friend(

How do we develop a cleaner, sustainable electric industry? The answer is
literally blowing in the wind. In fact, about 100 MW of new wind generation
will  be operating in Pennsylvania by 2001 * a small portion of the
Commonwealth,s  total wind resource, which is enough to produce about 13
billion kWh or 10% of  Pennsylvania,s total electricity consumption. But
challenges must be overcome to  keep this crop from fading into thin air.

Why are obstacles being overcome to make wind power part of Pennsylvania,s
energy future? Customers want clean energy, and wind is readily available,
especially in the northeastern, central and southwestern areas of our state.
While some other states have better wind resources, Pennsylvania has plenty
of  Class 3 wind resources and a good bit of Class 4, much of which is
located in  rural communities. Ironically, sufficient wind resources are also
often found in  formerly important coal centers that were decimated when
machines replaced human  labor and mines were emptied of marketable coal. It
could offer these  communities a sustainable economic future, as the wind is
never mined out.

Just one year ago, when E-cubed discussed reasons to &Go With the  Wind,8
(Vol. I, No. 9, 9/14/99) no commercial wind farms were operating in
Pennsylvania, but our state had, and still has, the most vibrant customer
choice  program in America. Today, there are already two new, clean renewable
wind  generation facilities that were built in direct response to consumer
demand.

The 10.4 MW Green Mountain Farm in Garrett, Somerset County, can produce
about 25,000 MWh of electricity, enough to serve about 2,500 households each
year. The 130 kW Pennsylvania Wind Energy Project in Hazleton, Luzerne
County, can produce about 200,000 kWh of electricity and will double in size
this fall. But even when additional 130kW turbines are installed, Community
Energy,s &wind block8 sales will have served only about half of the small
commercial customer load that subscribed to its limited &pilot8 marketing
program. These two operating wind farms avoid 123 tons of S02, 12,000 tons
of CO2, and 4,700 tons of  NOx.

Two larger wind farms are expected to be operating next year. Atlantic
Renewable and International Wind are developing a 15.6 MW Mill Run wind farm
in  Fayette County, and National Wind Power is developing a facility near
Scranton,  Lackawanna County, which will produce at least 15 MW initially.
Although not all  will be completed by the end of 2001, seven other projects
by five active wind  developers are scheduled to provide an additional 110 MW
of new wind generation  in Pennsylvania during and after 2001. The wind
industry expects that about 200  MW could be built in Pennsylvania within two
to three years. If 100 MW of  additional wind generation replaced system
power, Pennsylvania would avoid 1,250  tons of SO2, 123,000 tons of CO2  and
48,000tons of NOx.

These new wind developments are fueled not just by wind, but by investment
dollars and consumer demand as well. The Pennsylvania Wind Development
Program  recently announced the availability of wind energy production
incentives, for  new facilities that become operational by the end of 2001,
of up to 1.5  cents/kwh for five years. The program, operated for the
Sustainable Development  Fund by The Reinvestment Fund, will receive $12
million from settlement of the  PECO/Unicom merger, which is expected to
become final in November.

Construction by the end of 2001 is also important because the federal
Production Tax Credit for new wind development expires at that time, and it
is  unclear if it will be renewed.

Production incentives are crucial for wind power, especially in
Pennsylvania, where wind resources tend to peak in both the winter and
during  the late evening hours when the demand for electricity is low. In the
current  market, the estimated average energy value from wind power is only
about 1.5 to  2.0 cents/kWh. The &green attribute8 can fetch about another
2.0 cents/kwh for  total market revenues of around 4.0 cents per
kilowatt-hour.

California wind production, on the other hand, generally peaks in the
afternoon when the demand for electricity is high, resulting in average
electric  sales value of approximately 3.0 cents/kWh.

By comparison, wind costs about 5.0 cents per kilowatt-hour to produce in
Pennsylvania. The cost is on the way down, although it could be some time
before it dips as low as the 3.0 cents and less mark in those areas of the
country with the very best wind resources.

However, total generation costs of Pennsylvania wind compare favorably to
all-in nuclear generation costs, such as Limerick,s 8.5 cents/kwh and
Susquehanna's near 7.0 cent all-in cost, but still cost about 33% more than
total costs of a new fossil fuel plant. Of course, existing nuclear plants
do  not have to recover the all-in production costs through the market,
because  those costs are subsidized by stranded costs payments. The $12
million of  funding in the Pennsylvania Wind Development Program is a drop in
the bucket  compared to the billions of dollars that subsidize nuclear power
plants.

Another challenge to new wind power is that the exploding demand for wind
turbines throughout the world and the rush to build American wind farms by
December 2001 are stressing the capacity of turbine manufacturers to meet
orders. Only five qualified wind manufacturers do business in the U.S. Of
the  five, two are taking no new orders through 2001, while two others have
limited  capacity remaining for additional orders. The leading manufacturers
are  unfortunately not American but European * many are just beginning to
have enough  business in the U.S., and Pennsylvania in particular, to
support necessary  sales and operating support.

If turbines are available to harvest the wind, Pennsylvania,s wind resource
is sufficient for commercial development, but does not generate as much or
as  valuable electricity as in other states. For example, some states may
have Class  5 wind that blows strong and steady during peak electric load
times. The best  sites in Pennsylvania are only Class 4, and the wind often
blows intermittently.  In addition to the lower average price for the
electricity generated at off-peak  times, the resource at a site is crucial
to project finances and requires  detailed assessment. A site generally must
be &metered8 for a full year before  investors will make a commitment to a
project.

Although there are no technical barriers to interconnection of wind
generation to the grids in Pennsylvania, the intermittent nature of wind
also  makes interconnection with a system based on predictable generation
more  difficult and less economic. For example, some operating systems still
have  rules that impose substantial penalties for inaccurate scheduling of
generation,  even though the real time balancing markets required under FERC
Order 2000  should eliminate the need for these penalties. The intermittent
nature of wind  makes such rules especially burdensome for wind projects.

On the bright side, some of the early problems with wind generation are
successfully being overcome. New wind turbines now purr along quietly
compared  to older technologies. New turbines also turn quite slowly and
developers are  sensitive to the rights of birds to fly. While wind turbines
were once  considered eyesores, the sleek postmodern look is increasingly
found attractive,  especially in comparison to transmission lines, cell
towers, or the strip mining  that often occurred on the same land upon which
the turbines are now being  built.

Communities also are welcoming wind projects, not just because problems
related to noise, birds, or view sheds can be minimized, but as important
rural  economic development and supplementary income to farmers. A farmer can
receive  rental income of about $2,700 per year per turbine erected on a tiny
portion of  farmland without significant interference to farming operations.
A 15-turbine  wind farm could add $40,000 in annual income to a hard-pressed
small  farmer.

A rural township can also expect a boost in its tax base.  For example, when
the wind farm was built, the Garrett tax base increased about  100%. And,
local construction contracts comprise about 20% of the cost of a new  wind
development, so that a $15 million wind farm generates about $3 million.
Conservation Consultants, Wind Farm USA Project works in farming areas with
the  best wind development potential to help rural communities understand
the  economic as well as environmental benefits of new wind development.

Pennsylvania will never have the best wind resources, but the remaining
challenges facing its wind industry can readily be overcome. The federal
Production Tax Credit should be extended for several years, the Pennsylvania
Wind Development Program should be expanded, and system operators should
correct  their rules in order to eliminate unnecessary barriers to the
development of our  burgeoning wind industry.

Ultimately, consumer demand may resolve these problems. If consumer demand
is strong enough, the manufacturers, markets, systems operators and others
will  find doing business in Pennsylvania wind to be just another day at the
office,  or should we say, down on the farm.
