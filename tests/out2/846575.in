Dave, I still believe that the most flexible model that provides high ROCE
and has growth not constrained by capital is the one being employed by
Enron.  I think the cash on cash returns on these Genco's in the short run
will be good; however, I think it will be difficult for these companies to
move quickly to react to market opportunities given their need to protect
their long position (not unlike our friends in the oil & gas producing
sector).  The returns and value provided by these companies will be primarily
be based on the timing of new production and their asset base and they will
realize (on a relative basis) very little from the trading.

It is not a bad model just a different one.

Either way, they will be  a strong bid for assets given their story to Wall
Street.
