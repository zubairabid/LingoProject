This is a proposed margin agreement from Pacificorp.  We are out of the money
over $250mm and they are getting nervous.  Tracy and I are trying to get them
to sign an EEI but they are dragging their feet.  Let's discuss a strategy
for moving forward.
If this agreement is not bad from a legal perspective than I am okay with
moving forward with some changes to the credit levels.  However, if it is not
acceptable we should put pressure on them to sign an EEI.
