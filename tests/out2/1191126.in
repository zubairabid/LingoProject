Jonathan, Ned,

Enron Europe Limited would be fine, thanks.

And a couple of other questions, which blend with the ones I mentioned below.

has there been issued any statement by the CFTC or other regulatory body
regarding the point about marketing via the Internet not infringing 30/10
relief, i.e without breaching the limited marketing rules?  Can LME Contracts
therefore be marketed via the EnronOnline website to US customers, bearing in
mind that the underlying principal to the LME Contract would (so far as
EnronOnline is concerned) be Enron Metals Limited (formerly known as MGL)?
As an aside, each Counterparty that is given access to the EnronOnline system
is required to execute certain "access" documentation - for the US, the Enron
entity to these documents is EnronOnline LLC, and for Europe, the entity is
Enron Power Operations Limited.  In each case, EnronOnline LLC and Enron
Power Operations Limited execute these documents on behalf of themselves as
well as their group undertakings.  But note that no cases will EnronOnline
LLC or  Enron Power Operations Limited be the Enron contracting entity to any
trade concluded via EnronOnline.
is MG London Inc. (the FCM) required to act as agent or as principal under
the LME Contracts with US customers, or can it merely market to US customers
and then pass these on to Enron Metals Limited in London for execution,
whether offlline or via EnronOnline?

Thanks.
Justin
