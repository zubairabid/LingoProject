Andy,

Testing process began approx Feb 7th after the link was in:
They are able to login, get an weblogic session id, Request Prices, I have yet to see a Post Price request or Attempt Transaction.
Basically they are testing on receiving data back from us from their browser or their scripted programs.


One issue on going is making a connection to their server, which would cause an issue on Posting prices to their server.   We just received their server connection info (IP address, ports etc..) yesterday, thus we should be able to post prices to them once we complete our setup today.

The product control group was very responsive with regards to answering business questions from Linda Bradley@Houstonstreet.

If you need more detail let me know.  Hope this helps.
