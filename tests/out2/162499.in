Below is my first rough draft of a letter that could be sent from consumers
to FERC Chairman Hoecker.  Due to technical difficulties, I could not attach
the letter in a separate document, so I copied the letter and have reprinted
it below.
Having never been involved in this type of letter writing campaign, this was
a bit of a stab in the dark for me, so I welcome everyone's comments.  I am
also working on a letter that could be sent by senior management or CEOs of
high tech firms, but I wanted to get your feedback on this format before I
went forward on the high tech letter.
Let me know if you have any questions or comments.

Re: Electric Power Industry Reform
Dear Chairman Hoecker:
We are consumers or represent consumers of electric power.  We write to urge
you and your colleagues to take the initiative to address the intolerable
shortages and extreme price volatility that have become all too common in the
electric power industry.  It is imperative that the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission proceed expeditiously with the reforms needed to support a
competitive and efficient power supply industry to ensure a reliable supply
of power at the lowest possible cost to consumers.
There are many actions you and your colleagues should take to ensure that the
power supply in the U.S. remains sufficient and is available at reasonable
prices.  For example, you and your colleagues should remove roadblocks in the
nation,s electricity gird.  Under the current system, FERC regulations allow
many companies that own transmission systems to restrict access to their
transmission lines by competing electricity suppliers.  The result of this
policy is shortages, blackouts and skyrocketing prices.  Like the interstate
highway system, FERC should allow electricity to move from one state to
another just as freely as motorists do.  All electricity suppliers should
have the same access to the transmission lines in order to transport power to
where it is most needed.
FERC should also discourage electricity suppliers, reliance on spot and
short-term electricity markets for power supply.  Instead, FERC should urge
suppliers to purchase a portion of their power needs under long-term
contracts.  Locking in electricity costs at fixed prices protects consumers
from unexpected price swings that can be financially devastating.
We strongly urge you and your colleagues to seize the initiative on these
reforms.  Consumers deserve a power supply industry that is both more
reliable and economical.
Very truly yours,
