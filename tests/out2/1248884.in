Thanks, Bret -- that's helpful.  Let me be clear, however.  There will most likely be no (firm) transportation contract in association with this project.  Like the other two power plant projects we put in last year, we will work out a Facility Construction (and/or) Operations Agreement that will set forth the mechanism by which TW will be reimbursed for its expenses (capital and O&M).  I've asked the San Juan Team to look at the possible routing with an eye towards underlying ownerships and ease of right-of-way.  They'll be working with facility planning (Ron Matthews) to put their recommendations into a revised drawing and estimate, if necessary.  We'll keep you guys posted.  Thanks again.
