FYI!  Elvis Energy is adding a new meter set to their existing contract.  The
meter will be at Bridgeport and is estimated to do about 15 dths a day.  The
meter number is not known at this time, but the well name is Eulah Shaw #1
and is located in Barbour County, WV.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Heidi
