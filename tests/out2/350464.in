The tariff we are drafting for the e-Trans project its a "load pay" tariff.
All the fixed costs are born by loads. Most of the capacity related anciallry
services also wind up with load serving entities, i.e., regulation, requency
response and operating reserves.  Our trading operations would system face
congestion costs, losses and any mismatch between what they schedule and what
is delivered (balancing).
If you want to avoid real-time congestion costs, you can buy a Flowright and
obtain forward price certianty.  We also provide for after the fact trading
of imbalances as well.  Flowrights can be obtained in an auction or by
initial allocation.  The initial allocations are phase out over four years
once there is a history of congestion costs on which market participants can
base auction bids.  All parties existing rights are converted to Flowrights
so everyone is under the same tariff.  Access fees are paid by all to the RTO
and used to pay the Transmission Owners for their revenue requirement.
Service to native load becomes an explicit purchase under the tariff, not
moving money from the left to the right pocket of a vertically integrated
utility.
