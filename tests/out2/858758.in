I received several responses to an e-mail from a reader last week regarding
UT's uniforms and whether the Longhorns should change them. Here are some of
the responses ...



One of your recent respondents indicated that UT needed to alter their
uniforms. I just wanted to go on record as thinking they are the  classiest,
coolest uniforms in the country! I admit to being biased, but  love the
simple, non-busy look of the all-white uniforms. I also have no  problem with
the color of the burnt orange as the person suggested. The  white helmets
with the simple, yet very distinguished longhorn emblem is as  pronounced as
the "star" on the Dallas Cowboys' helmet. While I agree with him about the
black shoes, I think any changes to "individualize" or  otherwise change
their "look" would be a move in the wrong direction. - Rick Peurifoy

I was interested in John Pharr's comments about the UT uniforms. Having been
at UT in the 1960s, I have seen the changes in the uniforms come and go. I
certainly think the best uniforms were in the 1969 season (perhaps influenced
by a national championship?). These were burnt orange jerseys (sans
individual name on back and "TEXAS" on the front), with the plain white pants
and orange stockings. The white uniform still had the orange stockings but
the jersey was white. You may remember that Fred Akers brought the
"candy-striped" pants (ala OU) and added the "TEXAS" to the jersey.
Personally I like the jersey, but think the return of the orange stockings
would add something to both uniforms, but particularly the road white. One
amusing memory when Darrell Royal was questioned about the plainness of the
uniforms; his response was that these are "work clothes" and not intended to
be fancy. I agree with you that the helmet is very distinctive and goes back
a long way. I recall there was an orange single stripe in addition to the
Longhorn in the early 1960s, but it didn't add much. Keep up the good work. I
always enjoy your newsletter. - Tom Thornell

Ignore all that guff about the Longhorns uniforms. I think they are among
the sharpest anywhere. If we change the helmets, then we look like a high
school team. What that guy needs to remember for away games is that we are
orange and white. Period. So what if it doesn't have too much color? I hope
we stay exactly the same. Remember when Tennessee changed their uniforms and
added orange pants? They looked like a bunch of ice cream men on the field. -

Longhorn Q & A
Q: Can you give us a look at the bowl picture?
Sandy Martin

BROWN:  Texas accepted an invitation to the Holiday Bowl on Wednesday and
will face either Oregon State or Oregon. It will be Oregon State if the
Beavers don't get a BCS berth. It will be Oregon if the Beavers do get a BCS
berth. If OU beats Kansas State, look for the Wildcats to go to the Cotton
Bowl. Nebraska would go to the Alamo Bowl; Iowa State would go to the
Insight.com Bowl; Texas Awould go to the Independence Bowl in Shreveport and
play former coach Jackie Sherrill and Mississippi State; and Texas Tech would
go to the galleryfurniture.com Bowl.

Chris Simms

Q: I'm very happy for Chris Simms, but what should we expect from him now? It
seems that he would be less inclined to redshirt, although one could argue
that he might like the opportunity to showcase for more than one year. Still,
since he finally got the chance to show what he can do without getting yanked
after five passes, a redshirt seems like a reach. If he doesn't redshirt,
what is

the best guess for Texas QB in 2001? I know that you get asked this every
week, but with the new development following the Agame, it seems that we are
starting fresh in this story.
Kyle Moore

BROWN:  Simms' big-time performance against Aadds all kinds of new wrinkles
to the landscape for 2001. My best guess is Simms will get the start for the
bowl game and we'll be back in the same situation we were heading into this
season. Major Applewhite's knee injury (this time to his right knee) again
gives UT coaches a reason to go with Simms, not only now but heading into the
spring and next fall. Mack Brown said on Monday that he wouldn't rule out a
rotation again. But one would have to think after the sluggish start the
offense suffered with a rotation this year that the coaches would be
reluctant to do that again. Despite breaking nearly every passing record at
Texas, Applewhite didn't look as sharp as he has in the past during his last
outings before getting injured. Simms would seem to have everything going his
way. The coaches finally saw what they were hoping to see from Simms earlier
this season. Now that they've seen it, you would have to think that they want
to start getting more experience for the guy who will lead them the next two
years (not stick with a guy who only has one season left). I'm not saying
that's fair. But it seems like it might be the way the UT coaches would
think. But we won't know how the QB situation for 2001 will shake out until
next fall, most likely.



Q: Seems like with the receivers and the talent at TE returning, UT could
have three receivers every down and teams would have their hands full. Do you
think B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas will see more playing time from now on?
Did they just blossom during the Agame? Otherwise, why haven't they seen the
field more?
A.B.

BROWN:  Texas will probably be a multiple offense again next season, but you
could certainly argue that UT should use more three-receiver sets next year
with one tight end because of the overwhelming talent the Longhorns will have
back at those positions. There is sentiment on the UT coaching staff that the
fullback position was pretty average this season. So the coaches will take a
strong look at Will Matthews this spring at FB. At 6-3 and 235, he has the
size. He is also quick with good hands. If Matthews doesn't add significant
oomph to the FB position, it could be argued that UT should try to use more
one-back sets and get its WR talent on the field. But we'll see. UT coaches
did a nice job of adjusting this season to a two-back, two-receiver set after
they realized they were overwhelming their young receivers (with too many
formations and too many quarterbacks). Now that the receivers can probably
handle more of the playbook, look for UT to be as multiple and complex an
offense as possible next season. B.J. Johnson finished the year as the team's
second-leading receiver, so he saw the field plenty. Sloan Thomas was the one
who had it tough because he had to learn all of the wide receiver positions
and be ready to fill in at any of them. So he was slowed by the learning
process and then had to fight for playing time with Montrell Flowers and
Brandon Healy. Healy is a senior, so he'll be gone next year. Flowers should
be worried about his playing time with Thomas lurking.



Q: Who are some of the players to watch heading into the spring who are
either redshirting or transferred?
Bart Fields

BROWN:  Chris Simms on Monday said that the two receivers who run the
sharpest routes in practice are redshirt freshman Tony Jeffery and transfer
Kyle Shanahan (the son of Denver Broncos coach Mike Shanahan). Simms said
both will really help the team a lot next year. Jeffery is 6-2 and trying to
bulk up from 170 pounds. Shanahan is 6-3 and trying to bulk up from 170
pounds. But both have shown great hands in practice. The first two names that
jumped off of Mack Brown's lips when asked about players to watch in bowl
practice and spring practice were redshirt freshman LBs Austin Sendlein and
Rashad Thomas. With Texas losing four linebackers after next season (De'Andre
Lewis, Everick Rawls, Marcus Wilkins and Tyrone Jones), Brown said some new
faces will have to play a bunch in 2001 to be ready to become starters at
linebacker in two years.



Q: I'm a little concerned about our running backs. Next year's crop looks
mighty inexperienced. We never seemed to be able to run up the middle
consistently this year. Who would you figure has the best shot at being an
inside bruiser? What role will our fullbacks play?
Russell Phillips

BROWN:  It's the biggest question mark on an offense that should be
absolutely loaded next season. I know the line loses tackles Leonard Davis
and Cory Quye, but Robbie Doane and Mike Williams should be able to take over
at tackle nicely. Mack Brown also said that redshirt freshman OT Lionel Garr
has lost about 30 pounds (from 360 to 330) and looks good. So with a line
that should continue to improve, the Longhorns just need a back who can run
behind it. Brown said he challenged all the backs to step it up as Hodges
Mitchell gets ready to finish his eligibility. Coaches want Victor Ike, Kenny
Hayter and Ivan Williams to toughen up and grow up. Coaches have told those
three that Sneezy Beltran and possibly Cedric Benson will get a shot next
year because those three all had a shot this year and failed to produce
consistently.

Sloan Thomas

Q: With Sloan Thomas emerging like he has, is there enough room at wideout
for Artie Ellis next season?
Frank Seles

BROWN:  Don't be surprised to see Artie Ellis at tight end next season. At
6-3 and more than 200 pounds, he is a bit undersized but could add the
weight. His speed would give Texas the sure-handed, deep-threat tight end
they are trying to establish with Bo Scaife. It may be a longshot, but don't
be surprised.




Q: While watching the A&M-UT game, I noticed that UT received the ball at
the opening kickoff and the second-half kickoff. And UT got the wind at its
back in the 4th quarter. How did this happen, and if Awon the toss, why
would the Aggies choose to defer, give UT the ball at both kickoffs, and go
into the wind in the 2nd and 4th quarters?
Ryan M., Austin

BROWN:  Texas Awon the toss at the beginning of the game and chose the wind
at its back, giving Texas the ball into the wind in the first quarter. The
Longhorns then got the choice of the ball or the wind in the third quarter
and took the ball into the wind.



Q: Is there any chance that Mack Brown will ever hire a special team coach.
UT lost at least two games last year due to problems on special teams. This
year the Longhorns would have been 10-1 and possibly on their way to a BCS
game had it not been for a blocked punt that was run back for a touchdown
against Stanford. With money apparently not being a factor, I really do not
understand why Brown doesn't break down and hire some specialized help.
Don Stevenson, Huntington, Texas

BROWN:  I think Mack Brown is sticking with his current plan, which is to
divide all the special teams duties among his assistant coaches.

De'Andre Lewis making the tackle

Q: Coaches always talk about senior leadership and how important it is for a
winning team. We've had some great players in the past like Robert Brewer and
James Brown whose on-field performances may have been surpassed by their
off-field contributions. I think we're losing a lot of leadership this year
when Casey Hampton and Hodges Mitchell leave. Of the returning players, who
does it look like will step up as team leaders next year?
Keith Heugatter


BROWN:  On defense, Mack Brown said he'll look for Cory Redding and De'Andre
Lewis to take over as leaders after losing Casey Hampton, Shaun Rogers and
Greg Brown. On offense, UT will look to its quarterback, its young receivers
and linemen such as Antwan Kirk-Hughes of Waxahachie for leadership.



Q: What seniors will be missed the most heading into next season?
Steve Beauchamp

BROWN:  The obvious ones are Casey Hampton, Shaun Rogers, Greg Brown, Hodges
Mitchell and Leonard Davis. But the one that may be missed the most is Kris
Stockton. He kicked several game-winning field goals two years ago and has
done nothing but continue to break records since. He has been an afterthought
because he has been so automatic on field goals. He has also done an
excellent job of punting this season. Matt McFadden, a redshirt freshman,
will handle the kicking duties next year. And at punter, redshirt freshman
Justin Smith will compete with a junior college transfer who has committed to
the Longhorns for next year. That will be a huge question mark for Texas to
answer next season.


Q: Who do you pick in the Kansas State-OU game? Seems like OU is missing its
October magic. I'd have to take OU in a close one, 28-24. Heupel isn't great,
but he has that winning magic that would be great for a conservative offense
in the pros.
Andrew Bowen

BROWN:  I, too, think Oklahoma will pick it up just in time to continue its
Shock the World season. Heupel has to lead his team to victory and produce
some impressive numbers if he has any hope of winning the Heisman. The votes
are almost due and Chris Weinke is gaining momentum.



Q: Can you give us an update on the men's and women's basketball teams?
Lucius Thornton

BROWN:  The men's team has gotten off to a nice start with solid victories
over Navy, California and Indiana - any of which could help the Longhorns
down the road at tournament time. The Longhorns suffered a blowout loss to
Duke in the semifinals of the Preseason NIT, but coach Rick Barnes was able
to prove a point to his team about being intimidated. As of Tuesday night's
game with UT-San Antonio, Barnes had three freshmen in the starting lineup -
point guard Royal Ivey, small forward Brandon Mouton and center James Thomas.
Duncanville's Brian Boddicker has gotten increased minutes at forward. Chris
Owens has been a shot-blocking force, and transfer Maurice Evans is the
team's leading scorer, and is starting to hit a better percentage from the
floor. The men's team doesn't have another test until Dec. 9, when the team
plays at South Florida. Other games worth watching or getting tickets for
include home games against Illinois (Dec. 23) and Utah (Dec. 30). The women's
team has also gotten off to a nice start, with its only early-season loss
coming against Purdue. The women's team is relying on several newcomers,
including freshman forwards Stacy Stephens and Annissa Hastings. The team is
also relying heavily on sophomore Tai Dillard. So both teams are young with a
lot of upside.
