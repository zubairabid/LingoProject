Questions for Hunter:
1. What are the position limits for the traders on the central desk, maximum
long or short?
2. What are the steps to evaluating a trade with a third party?
3. How does a trader set their curves?  What information/knowledge is
required?
4. What information or tools, besides NYMEX, do you use to gage the market?

Carrie, that is all I can come up with right now, I will keep thinking and
let you know if anything comes up.
