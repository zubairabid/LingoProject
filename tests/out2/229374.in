We have received a revised Unanimous Consent of Directors dated 8/28/00
("Board Resolution") from the referenced Counterparty which expands the
approval given in their initial Board Resolution (provided when we executed
the ISDA Master Agreement) to allow them to enter into "pulp, lumber and
paper commodity price swap and options, and other commodity price swap and
option transactions"  with ENA.
For ClickPaper, this should allow them to trade all the financial products we
trade.  For EnronOnline, this should allow them to trade all commodity swaps
and options.  If Credit will add this to the next spreadsheets for both
ClickPaper and EnronOnline, I will amend my approval.
I will circulate a copy of the revised Board Resolution to Global Contracts
and Camille Gerard.
