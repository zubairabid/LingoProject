Jim Kopley with LIMITrader informed me that they have no objection to many of
the changes you suggested to the LIMITrader agreement, and he is confident
that he can address, to our satisfaction, the other concerns we raised.   Jim
encouraged you to call him at 212-499-2909 to discuss.
The only exception Jim noted related to our confidentiality issue, which Jim
forwarded to their attorney.
