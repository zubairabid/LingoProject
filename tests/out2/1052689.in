**IMPORTANT**

All,

I didn't catch the impact of this when I first saw it last week, but NYISO
is making a change that should cause real time prices to increase (relative
to historical prices) in cases where bid load is less than real time actual
load.  They will be committing GTs in the reliability pass of SCUC at an
incremental cost of zero (instead of committing a steam unit), which
increases the likelihood that GTs will run in real time under these
conditions, increasing real time prices.  The change goes into effect today
or tomorrow.  See below.
