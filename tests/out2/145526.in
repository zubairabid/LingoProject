Gerald,
As you know, ECS is working several deals with EES pricing.  They provided a
draft agreement that should represent
what would be executed between the groups.  They are looking for comments
from us relative to the draft which I believe
is good timing since we will be closing something prior to year end 00.

I suggested that Bo set up a short meeting with their attorney for us to meet
and discuss.
We should be hearing from them soon.

thanks
mk
