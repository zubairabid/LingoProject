This deal was a sleeve done for EES, and we've had problems with the trade
dates on these before. EES reported this trade to us on 12/6/00, and it was
Matt Motley's understanding that the trade was executed the previous day. He
doesn't care either way, but he suggested you talk to someone at EES - maybe
Jubran Whalan or Neil Bresnan - about what their intent was with the date.
In the meantime, I can change the date to 12/4 if you'd like. What would be
best? E-mail or call and let me know.
