As the father of two juvenile diabetics and a Walk Co-Team Captain (with
Shonnie Daniel) here at Enron, I am writing to request you to participate in
Enron's drive to help raise money for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation's
("JDF") annual Walk to Cure Diabetes.  The Walk takes place at 9:00 a.m.,
Sunday, November 5, 2000, at Sam Houston Race Park.  The Walk itself is
extremely enjoyable and it is a festive occasion with hospitality tents,
food, music and lots of kids.

You can participate by walking (and obtaining sponsors) or by sponsoring a
walker (such as myself or my children).  Last year, the ENA legal team
contributed over $5,000 to the Walk (and there is a dollar-for-dollar Enron
match), which put us in the top 5 teams at Enron.

If you intend to contribute   and walk, let me or Shonnie know and we will
get you the necessary forms. If you don,t intend to walk, your sponsoring
contributions should be made by check payable to &JDF8 and you can give that
check to me or Shonnie.  If you want to participate in either way and want me
to call you with more information, there is a sign up sheet on my office
window across from the Ladies Room on 38.

Juvenile diabetes is an auto-immune disease where the child's immune system
attacks and destroys his or her pancreatic cells that produce insulin.  As a
consequence, my children need daily doses of insulin to live, and they must
closely regulate their diet, exercise and blood sugar. This treatment
involves at least 2 insulin injections and 5 blood tests a day, and they will
never "outgrow" this disease.

Heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, blindness, loss of limbs and nerve
damage are just some of the complications that are associated with diabetes.
As you can imagine, with such possibilities, there is also a significant
psychological price to pay with this disease.  The prospect of a cure )
funded in part by contributions from friends like you ) does truly make all
the difference to the outlook of these young people by giving them hope for
the future.  Experts believe that with adequate funding of diabetes research,
a cure or at least less intrusive and more effective treatments are possible
within the next five years.

Thank you for your consideration of this worthy cause.
