Dear Eric,

Keep up the good work!  Election Integrity 2000 is already
over 254,000 petitions to Certify the Bush Victory in
Florida.  We're going to see this thing through to the end
so please continue to spread the word.

Fortunately, there are many other groups out there fighting
to prevent Al Gore from stealing this election.  I'm
forwarding an e-mail I just received from the editor of
Newsmax.com describing their emergency campaign to get the
truth out.  Check it out!

For Election Integrity,

Bruce Eberle
