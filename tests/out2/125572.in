Jeff,
I had informed them that I was out Monday, however they scheduled the
meeting anyway.  I forwarded our standard enfolio to Teresa for this deal.
She wants to delete the $0.15 from 3.2 and 3.4.  I suggested that we delete
it in the transaction documents, but I think she will insist that it be taken
out of the master.  I had requested that they invite Scott Neal to the
meeting to discuss what they viewed as their obligation if the producer did
not deliver the production payment volumes.  They had suggested that they use
the enfolio default mechanism to calculated the $ damages, but in lieu of
paying the $s, they would deliver a volume equal to such $s in a future
undefined period.  Later they agreed that because of the financial hedge that
was being put into place, they could pay such $ damages  at the time of
default.
If they need someone from gas trading, can you attend Monday.  I am going to
leave Teresa a message requesting that she try to get Scott Neal or his
representative to attend and to let you know if your attendance was needed.
