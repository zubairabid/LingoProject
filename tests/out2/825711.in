Mandey,
The Cox contract expired effective 12/1, so we should not have any gas coming
to us from them.  The confirmation with PG&E should be adjusted. The Tribo
deal is good.  If PG&E allocates gas to them, we are ok.  (I don't think they
have been allocated gas in the last 7 months.)  Carlos probably has a contat
with Cox.  Either you or he can call them to see if they have sold any of
their interests.
