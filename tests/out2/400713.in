I regret to report that I just ended a very unproductive phone conversation
with Mr. Hertzberg.  He thanked us for all our cooperation but politely
declined to give me any information on what authority he was relying on to
conclude that there is a jurisdictional problem.  However, it sounded to me
like whatever authority he does have is shaky at best.  He also sounded
interested in the possibility of our making some sort of anonymous inquiry at
FERC (if such a thing is possible) on the issue.  Obviously they are very
leery of making that phone call themselves and risking revealing their
identity.  He said he would discuss it with Ed Meaders.  Also, he mentioned
that after tomorrow he will be on vacation for a month, and another attorney
will be taking over in his absence.  That could be good, or it could be bad.
Maybe Lorraine can sweet talk Meaders into at least citing us some cases from
Hertzberg's memo.  At the very least, I hope he will show it to the Kinder
Morgan lawyers.
