I will be thinking about you and Brenda over the weekend and know that you
will both be glad for her to return home.  I have mentioned to you before,
Hector, that an Enron friend has dealt with a brain tumor successfully.  That
is Barbara Gray, an attorney in ENA's Legal Department.  Barbara counsels
patients and their families who are facing situations similar to hers.  If
you feel like you would like to talk with someone who can understand on a
more firsthand basis what you and Brenda are facing, I would encourage you to
contact Barbara.  In addition to having been through her own battle with a
brain tumor, she is simply a wonderful person whom I know you would enjoy
meeting.  I have mentioned your situation to her, and she would certainly
welcome a conversation with you.

I will be in the London office next week, so we will have to coordinate on
merit increases from there.  I will be back in the office on Monday, January
22.  -Sally
