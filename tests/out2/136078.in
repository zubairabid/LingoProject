A perfected (or nearly perfected) ROW may have some merit, especially as ENA
continues their negotiations to further develop that power plant in
Albuquerque.  I'll have Jeff call ENA, and without giving anything away, find
out how their negotiations are progressing.  I wonder to what extent Dennis'
agreement with the tribe is transferable?
