Just so you had the latest matrices; although some of you directly received
these materials.  I anticipate being able to send you a revised draft of the
Purchase and Sale Agreement by next Tuesday morning.  No doubt, everything
will become clear in the next draft - materiality, Subject Companies,
required Authorizations, etc.  I anticipate circulating a full draft of the
Schedules by mid next week.  The plan would be to revise the draft schedules
based on the revised text of the Agreement and your further review of the
respective businesses generally.  We will also need to keep in mind some
sense of conformity as to how each unit is making their respective
disclosures.  The Schedules will not need to win an award for beauty at that
point, but do need to be well organized and make sense.  I encourage each of
the General Counsels to coordinate with Mary Joyce on HR matters, Frank Smith
or Dave Nutt on environmental matters, Cullen Duke on tax matters, Bob
Williams and Chuck Cheek on litigation matters, Rick Shapiro on regulatory
matters, and Jim Bouillion on insurance matters, just to make sure nothing
slips through the cracks.  Timing of course is critical.  The Disclosure
Schedules may become critical path items, and we may all hear that.    I
expect there will be great progress generally next week, and there will be
tremendous pressure to deliver a complete draft of the Schedules to Skadden
soon after the end of next week.  Your comments would likely need to be in by
the end of the week - sorry.  Please be aware that the Business Unit heads,
right before execution of the Agreement, are likely to have to sign-off on
the disclosures under the Agreement.  Truly, thanks for all the help.  Send
money or Disclosure Schedules.  Lance.
