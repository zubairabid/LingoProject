We have had issues in the past with Canada not informing us of all of their
Merchant investments.  For six months we chased Invasion Debt and finally
received enough information to put it on the MPR in August (only after it was
placed in Raptor I).  Also, about six months ago, John Lavorato asked about
an asset called CNR Warrants that showed up on the "hot list" but we were
told by Canada that they were going to sell it so they did not want it on the
MPR.  Today, we were told that Kyle Kitagawa wanted to sell an asset called
Genoil (approx. 4.7 million shares).  Again, we did not know that they owned
this investment.  We have contacted Donna Lowry about Genoil because Beau
Canada is on the restricted list and think Genoil would be, too.
A trip to Canada may be necessary in order to reinforce our full disclosure
policies regarding the MPR.  Please let me know if I can provide any
additional information.
