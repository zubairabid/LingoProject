Mark,
Pursuant to our earlier conversation, I have the following questions which
relate to the Financial Services Authority's Conduct of Business rules:
1. The Agreement provides that the Broker may "from time to time effect
transactions with or for ENA in Non-Readily Realisable Investments (as
defined in the Rules)"
I presume this is acceptable, but please confirm.
2. The Agreement provides that  "the protections in the Rules on giving
suitable advice will not apply"
Again I presume this is acceptable since we will probably not be using their
advice, but please confirm.
3. The Agreement provides that "Any monies arising in the normal course of
business  will be held by our agent in accordance with the Financial Services
Regulations 1991 and the relevant rules of FSA."
Please confirm that this is acceptable.
4. The Agreement provides that it shall be governed by English law and that
ENA submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the English courts.  I know
that ENA has specific policies in the US relating to governing law and
submission to jurisdiction.  Please confirm with me that the above-referenced
provision is acceptable.
Thanks,
