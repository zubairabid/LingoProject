Mark,
We were trying to keep the PA to a single page due to concerns about the
amount of legalise which would need to be read - we didn't want the form to
be a deterrant. In this case, the addition is just some blank lines to insert
address for service (plus a few words in the body of the PA) - so I'm not as
concerned about the impact on length.
If we do not know the company, then a completed Registration Form is required
- if we do know the company, then the Registration Form is not required. It
could be argued that if we know the company, then we should already know the
address for service - but I assume this might lead to errors if the address
for service desired by the customer for  EnronOnline GTC's is any different
from what we have on file? - I assume this was the reason David Minns
forwarded this change.
I'm happy (and perhaps prefer) to have the address for service included only
on Australian PA's, if neither of you see a need elsewhere - although if you
don't think its necessary elsewhere, then perhaps it is also not necessary in
Australia, in which case we could simplify the form?
Please note Australia is already distributing forms with their marketing
packs, so if we are going to change the form, sooner is better.
Comments appreciated . . .
Dave
