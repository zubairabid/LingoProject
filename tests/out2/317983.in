I have attached two documents below --
Letter directed to SW to address their claim that title had passed --
Updated version of project chronology --
The Project Chronology document indicates letters or correspondence I am
trying to track down from EECC.  I would appreciate your comments on the
letter I plan to send to SW in repsonse to the December 8th fax and any
updates to the chronolgy that appear to be incorrect or lacking.
