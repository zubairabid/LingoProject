A MEMO FROM DICK AMABILE
Thanks for enrolling in the upcoming P&D Facilitation training.  In order to
make the best use of our limited time at the meeting I am attaching a copy of
the "draft" material which will appear on the Intranet Site regarding P&D
(Participation & Dissent).   The intent is for you to review the material
before the session to gain some insight into what P&D is all about.  This
will save us the time of having to review this material at the session and
allow us to focus specifically on facilitation skills for the P&D process.
We apologize for the somewhat disjointed format.  At the moment it is the
only complete draft that is available, albeit in pieces.  I suggest you start
with the last one listed below P&D Site maps.ppt and then progress through
them in order 1,2,3,4,5.
P&D  was develop as a response to three of the 5 core ETC (Now known as the
Pulse) questions identified by Enron for improvement. They are:
Most employees feel free to voice their opinions openly
My operating company does a good job acting on suggestions of employees
Employees are encourage to challenge established
procedures/policies/guidelines
Participation & Dissent know as "P&D" is an unique Enron created tool that is
designed to provide our employees with a creative, free wheeling,
non-bureaucratic vehicle for solving problems, addressing issues, enhancing
decision making and developing new business ideas/opportunities.   One
purpose of "P&D" is to create an atmosphere where employees can feel real
ownership for decisions and express their views in a challenging and
passionate way. "P&D" sessions are meant to focus on results and assist in
producing measurable performance improvements.  "P&D" sessions are to assist
our employees in driving change in an organized, efficient and effective
manner.  It will help us leverage off our own best practices to produce
faster results that positively impact our return on invested capital. At
Enron we give our employees the power to dissent and with that power comes
the obligation to participate in providing solutions/ideas.
If you have any questions about this material, please feel free to contact
Kirk McDaniel or myself.  We will be happy to answer your questions and
provide additional context for the effort.
The only other thing we would like you to do prior to attending the session
is to identify a potential P&D intervention within your own organization.
This will provide you with a "real" effort to begin planning for at the
session and make the application of the ideas directly actionable for you.
We look forward to seeing you at the meeting.
Dick Amabile
