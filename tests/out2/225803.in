I have been unable to reach Ana Sonia by phone as she has not returned to the
office and has not returned my telephone calls.  So, we are preparing
execution copies of the ISDA and will have these signed by ENA.  We will fax
and Federal Express these to EDEN with a cover letter explaining to fax the
signature page back, when they can expect the Enron Corp. guaranty and when
we can expect their opinion of counsel.  I will also explain this to Ana
Sonia by separate fax.  I just spoke with Jeff Kable and explained this to
him.  Susan Bailey is here all day but she is out next week (and I am out
next week as well).  However, Marie Heard will help out next week.  Let me
know if you have any questions.  Sara
