My several hours of on-line research on this last Sept. turned up nothing on
point.  The only case that even addressed the issue of confidentiality of
contracts in a certificate context was one I'll excerpt here:

**
In Maritimes & Northeast Pipeline, L.L.C., 80 FERC P 61,346 (1997),
Maritimes requested confidentiality for the precedent agreements it
submitted. Commission staff denied the blanket request, but indicated that
Maritimes could request that specific provisions be kept confidential.
Maritimes subsequently requested that the contract terms and various cut-off
dates [FN29] in the precedent agreements be kept confidential because such
information was commercially sensitive. On the other hand, Maritimes
requested that the terms and conditions of the backstop agreements be kept
confidential, but was willing to make the contract terms of 10 and 20 years
public. Generally, the Commission will deny blanket requests for
confidentiality of agreements that are submitted to demonstrate market
support for new facilities. [FN30] However, in the instance case, the
contract terms of the backstop agreements are public and, thus, evidence of
longterm subscriptions for Maritimes proposal are in the public record and
support our finding that Maritimes has demonstrated a market for its proposed
services. Therefore, we find no compelling reason to require the length of
the terms of the other precedent agreements or the cut-off dates to be made
public.

FN29 Cut off dates refer to points in time when individual contracts could
terminate contingent on the
occurrence of certain events.

FN30 See, e.g., Colorado Interstate Gas Company, 76 FERC P 61,291 (1996).

In Amoco Production Company and Amoco Energy Trading Company V. Natural Gas
Pipeline Company of America, 82 FERC P 61,037 (1998), which involved a
request for confidentiality of a gas sales agreement, the Commission
explained why a gas sales agreement should be given confidential treatment
but transportation contracts should not:

the Commission has explicitly held that gas transportation rates stand on a
different
footing from gas sales rates because pipelines and their competitors are
subject to similar disclosure
requirements. In ANR Pipeline Co., the Commission explained that unlike gas
sales in a
competitive market, transportation of natural gas is still regulated under
the assumption that the pipeline
exercises market power. Even where transportation competition exists, that
competition is from other
pipelines that are likely to be subject to similar filing and reporting
requirements.

There were several cases denying confidential treatment of rates in the
context of Section 4 cases.

Just to make sure I found everything, I'll do some follow up sometime in the
next few days and let you know if I find anything.
