Per letter dated 12/23/99, Merchant Energy Group of the America's requested
the termination of the CES GISBs and ISDA as it was their preference to use
the existing ENA Ks (Master Purchase/Sale #96017205 & ISDA #96019306). I have
set the termination dates for the CES/CEM GISBs (CES GISB #96028991 & CEM
GISB #96028994) to 4/30/00 so that they will be reported in the monthly
termination/expiration report. Please note that the CEM GISB is in your
(Stacy/Debra) stack of non-executed contracts that we (Galye & I) sent up
last month. It can now be routed to the file room (at least that is one
'solved' out of the stack). I've forwarded a copy of the letter to Anthony so
he can take care of the CES ISDA (K#96029703).
