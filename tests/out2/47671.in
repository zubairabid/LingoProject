We now have a self-calculating cuts template.  There are two, one located in
P:/RealTime/Cuts_Worksheet   and one located in P:/Scheduling/Cuts_Template.

These are both write protected, but once you add your changes just do a save
as and save as the date. This will allow you to calculate the cuts to your
schedules very quickly, and verify their accuracy immediately. Spaces are
provided to record paths, tag numbers and enpower deal numbers.  If you try
this and think of improvements, please don't hesitate to get with me.

Also,  the extra SW transmission is now shown on the Available Transmission
Capacity sheet in P:/Real Time.  Lisa will be updating the SW portion, and
Mike will continue to do his updates in the NW portion.  The left column has
been frozen to allow scrolling without losing the hour designation.

One last thing:  To have our CISO schedules on hand during these times,  just
go to the lotus dbase, do a sort by global ID, expand the day you wish to
see, and right click your mouse.  Select Print, and then in that dialog box
select "Print View."    This will work with any dbase view you need in Lotus.
