Steel Trading
On the steel trading side, we have just hired 4 steel traders, expanding the
steel team to 10 people totaling over 75 years of accumulated steel
experience.  Financial Hot Rolled steel swaps are on EnronOnline. Put and
call options are quoted and physical steel will be launched during the first
quarter of 2001.  The next goal for both originators and traders will be to
"Enronize" the new traders and educate the steel industry on our risk
management tools.
