Hello, Justin and Jon, this is Bob Bruce with the Enron North America legal
department in Houston.  Sara and I were wondering about a few things; perhaps
David Gilberg or someone else is already addressing these issues --
(1) Given MG London's status as a licensed FCM and CTA, did Enron's
acquisition of MG require any CFTC filing?  If so, Sara and I would like to
get a copy of the filing.
(2) Sara and I were also curious as to whether, or to what extent, CFTC
licensing/registration/disclosure requirements may apply "upward" to any
Enron entities or their officers.
Please let us know if you can shed any light on these areas, or if there is
someone else we should be checking with on these matters.  Thanks -- Bob
