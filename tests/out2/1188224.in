Apparently there was some miscommunication.  It was very clear to me after
our meeting in Louise's office that with respect to proposed Reference
Entities with which Enron has an existing business relationship you were
going to add the consent to the notice letter.  It was that consent that was
to dramatically speed up the process of determining which Reference Entities
could be listed.  As we discussed last week, without that consent each
proposed Reference Entity must be evaluated separately regarding whether or
not a confidentiality agreement is in place and whether or not the existing
business relationship is extensive enough to require consent.  Neither of
these evaluations will be easy or quick.  While Enron North America has been
reasonably good about compiling lists of confidentiality agreements, it is by
no means clear that all other Enron entities have done so.  We have not yet
determined a process for evaluating the extent of the existing business
relationships with our customers but that process will necessarily require
significant amounts of legal and commercial time at a high enough level to
make important judgment calls.
My impression was that you were willing to add the consents to the notice
letters since in one fell swoop it resolved a difficult legal issue and moved
your earliest possible launch date forward by weeks if not months but also on
the assumption that if a customer was not willing to give us their consent we
should not be taking the commercial risk that it was precisely those
customers whose relationships would be jeopardized by proceeding to use them
as a Reference Entity.
We will now move forward to develop the processes necessary to conduct the
evaluations mentioned above.  Please send the list of proposed Reference
Entities as soon as possible.
