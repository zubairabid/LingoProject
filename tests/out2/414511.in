Aquila wants to trade online under two names, Aquila Risk Management and
Aquila Energy Marketing.  They have asked us to attach to their ETA, a
listing, and copies, of all master agreements we have in place with those two
counterparties, whether physical, financial, gas, power, etc.  Can you look
those up for us and copy the relevant contracts?

Thanks for your help!
