David:
Tana and I would like to talk with you to set up the counterparty approval
process for EnronOnline regarding Australian counterparties (trading
Australian and other products) and Australian products being traded by
non-Australian counterparties.  The EnronOnline people are anxious that Tana
be designated their liaison and we need to figure out what she can do and
what you (or someone else in Australia) need to do as part of this process
going forward.  Any chance you might be available for a telephone
conversation about this at 9:00 am your time (5:00 pm Houston time) today?
