Below is a draft standby tariff that was prepared by Enron and others during
settlement negotiations in Mass (the tariff was never formally submitted)
that might be of use as we prepare for California Ph II (and New York).

Also, I was talking with Sara McKinley of the DPCA and they are not going to
participate in the Phase II proceeding due to lack of funding.  However, she
mentioned that CMA, Capstone, New Energy, and Honeywell have jointly hired
John Nimmons for this phase and that DPCA may endorse their testimony.  She
also asked if she could get a copy of our testimony to review and perhaps
endorse.
