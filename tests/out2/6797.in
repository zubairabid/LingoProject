As you are aware, Enron utilizes temporary staffing services to satisfy
staffing requirements throughout the company.  For the past several months, a
project team, representing Enron,s temporary staffing users, have researched
and evaluated alternative Managed Services programs to determine which source
would best meet our current and future needs in terms of quality, performance
and cost containment objectives.  The Business Unit Implementation Project
Team members are:

Laurie Koenig, Operations Management, EES
Carolyn Vigne, Administration, EE&CC
Linda Martin, Accounting & Accounts Payable, Corporate
Beverly Stephens, Administration, ENA
Norma Hasenjager, Human Resources, ET&S
Peggy McCurley, Administration, Networks
Jane Ellen Weaver, Enron Broadband Services
Paulette Obrecht, Legal, Corporate
George Weber, GSS

In addition, Eric Merten (EBS), Kathy Cook (EE&CC), Carolyn Gilley (ENA),
Larry Dallman (Corp/AP), and Diane Eckels (GSS) were active members of the
Selection Project Team.

As a result of the team,s efforts, we are pleased to announce the beginning
of a strategic alliance with CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group.  This group
will function as a vendor-neutral management entity overseeing all staffing
vendors in the program scope. They will also provide a web based online
technology tool that will enhance the ordering and reporting capabilities.
The goal of our alliance with CORESTAFF is to make obtaining a temporary
worker with the right skills and experience easier while protecting the best
interests of the organization.

We plan to implement Phase I of this improvement effective January 2, 2001.
This Phase I of the implementation will encompass administrative/clerical
temporary workers at the Houston locations only. If you currently have
administrative/clerical temporary workers in your department, the enhancement
will not affect their position. In an effort to preserve relationships, all
current staffing vendors will be invited to participate in this enhanced
program.  CORESTAFF shares our commitment to minimize any disruptions in
service during this transition.

We expect to incorporate the administrative/clerical workers in Omaha,
Seattle and Portland in Phase II, which is scheduled for February, 2001.  The
scope and timing of any additional phases will be determined after these two
phases have been completed.

Realizing the impact that the temporary workforce has in business today, we
selected CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group based on their exceptional
management team, commitment to quality service, and creative solutions to our
staffing needs.  The relationship promises to offer Enron a cost effective
and simple means for obtaining temporary employees.

In the coming weeks, Enron and CORESTAFF,s Managed Services Group will be
communicating to Enron,s administrative/clerical temporary staffing vendors
about the new process.

There are many benefits to this new Managed Services program, which are
outlined on the attached page.  More details on how to utilize CORESTAFF,s
Managed Services program will be announced soon and meetings will be
scheduled to demonstrate the reporting system and to meet the Managed
Services team.
