Hi Mark -

The Legal Group in London (Justin Boyd) has advised that office that it would
be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms.  Instead, the documentation teams
in London have been advised to include the following language on their
EnronOnline transactions that are governed under GTC's (not governed by
Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and Conditions
(GTC) that you have accepted via EnronOnline. For a copy of this GTC, please
click on the Product Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View
GTC".

Please advise if this policy may be applied to the EnronOnline transactions
for the Houston office.

Thanks -
Rob
