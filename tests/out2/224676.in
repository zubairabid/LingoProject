Interoffice
Memorandum

Enron's performance has been exceptional.  This performance is reflected in
our stock price, in the recognition we receive in the media and financial
communities, and, most importantly, in the enthusiasm of our people.  It has
been clear to us for some time that we are driving fundamental change in the
marketplace and that our natural gas, electricity and communications networks
can be positioned for even greater growth.  A &new economy8 is emerging, an
economy based on intellectual capital and the compelling economics of
networks.  Capturing the opportunities in this new economy calls for
increased coordination and integration across our wholesale (ECT, ECM, EI),
retail (EES), and communications (ECI) businesses.  It is our intention to
combine the operations of these businesses into a cohesive organization that
will ensure we realize the growth we foresee in all our businesses.

To this end, we are initiating a number of organization and staffing changes
in these businesses and related changes in the Enron Office of the Chairman,
in Corporate Staff groups, and in a number of management/personnel
committees.  Other business units, EOG, GPG, PGE, and Azurix, will not be
directly affected.  Accordingly, the following changes are effective
immediately.

Enron Office of the Chairman

Joe Sutton will join the Office of the Chairman as Vice Chairman.  In his new
role, Joe will work with the two of us to manage the operations of the
company.

Rebecca Mark, previously Vice Chairman of the company, will now fully
concentrate on her responsibilities as Chairman and CEO of Azurix, our most
recent public company. Rebecca has also been elected to the Enron Board of
Directors, effective today.

Ken Harrison, previously Vice Chairman of the company, will fully concentrate
on his responsibilities as Chairman and CEO of Portland General Electric and
Non-Executive Chairman of Enron Communications.  Ken will continue to serve
on Enron's Board of Directors.

Redefined Business Units

ECT, ECM, EI, EES, and ECI will be regrouped into eight regions/businesses
and five global functions.  Each region/business will be operated as an
independent entity but will coordinate staffing, career paths, compensation
and performance review across all units.  Each global function will provide
its specialized expertise across all regions/businesses.  Included in these
functions is a new technology function, which will focus on information
systems and growth of our e-commerce capabilities where we believe there is
enormous potential.  These organizational units and their leadership are as
follows:
