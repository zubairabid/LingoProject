Dan, as we discussed, herewith the EPOS Officer's Certificate.  Again, and
sorry for the short notice, we need a fax of the Certificate before 11 a.m.
this morning, Houston, time, for the closing/funding.  Again, the certificate
is being requested from our lawyers, Vinson & Elkins, so that they may
release their opinion in connection with the closing.  They must have the
Certificate in order to do so.
Thanks Dan, and please call me at 202 628 1700, or my cell 713 854 8000, or
Francisco Pinto 202 639 6699, or his cell 713 301 8882, should you have any
questions.
