Lee,
Here's a revised draft incorporating your two suggestions:
I've forwarded what I have on the CO (#3) for South America to their lawyer,
so I hope it will be wrapped up soon.
I've seen reference to the Pleasanton CO, and I know it is in the works as
well.  It is percolating through the system.
Do you have the electronic file for the LV CoGen change order (#4), extending
the delivery dates?
I'll be in on Monday, although I have a heavy conference call schedule.  I'll
be easiest to catch towards the end of the day.
