Hi Gerald:  We have  executed agreements  with Amoco Corp. and several
affiliates relating to everything from possible purchase of Amoco Gas Company
to producer financing of purchase of some of their assets.  One between HPL/
Amoco Production Company relates to evaluation of Tyler Field.  None have
restrictive provisions that would preclude another agreement to the best of
my knowledge.  Let me know if you would like to see any of them or you are
welcome to come and browse.
