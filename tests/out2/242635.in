Paul:
John Fortunato has advised me that CP has only three (3) issues with the
draft which we delivered in November, 2000.  The credit issues are:
(1)  CP financials available online - we'll need their website address
(2)  CP Threshold for cross default is too low and wish a "higher number" but
have not given John any indication of what they want
Please let John and Stephanie know the outcome so that we can prepare
executable docs.  Thanks.
P.S.  The legal issue was governing law, Texas or NY.  CP doesn't care but
needs confirmation and possibly explanation.
