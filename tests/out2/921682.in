First, please respond to me today and let me know to whom the analyst will be
reporting and what their responsibilities will be for the summer.  Hopefully
none of this is a surprise and the appropriate arrangements have been made
for desk, phone and computers for all.

Secondly, please make a point of seeking out these interns and welcoming them
to Enron.

Finally, after I know where these analysts are placed, we will have a brief
meeting with the analysts' managers and any of you under whom they will be
working to discuss ideas on making the analysts assignments meaningful this
summer.  I welcome ideas on this from any of you.
