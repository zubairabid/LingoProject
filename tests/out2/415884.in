Ms. Jones,
Job ID#0000103522, here I come!!!
I just sent IT via e-mail to Gretchen Jennings. Wish me  luck.
The more I read the job functions and requirements, the more I  like it. It
is so much of what I have been doing, but I would have more  CONTROL.. Might
even get a little respect!!!
I am THE one, oh, yeah, I AM THE ONE!!!!!
Thanks again for helping me. I will continue to check  the website. I did
see another one, #103640, that is a possibility, and  #103659. Did you ever
hear anything from the people that you sent my  resume to the first time
around? I will be glad to get their phone numbers  and start calling...
