See attached for our changes.  I am typing the Annex IV stuff now  - it has
to do with Sections 26.4 and 26.5 - resolution of certain Purchaser-Agent
Disputes.  We also will need to put in the currently-being-negotiated
assignment language, so the bank knows that they have access to their
collateral.
Barnas said he was drafting that after the last version Kay drafted.  I have
not seen it yet.
