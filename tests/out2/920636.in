All fixed priced deals (esp. Calpine) have their risk assigned to the Price
Book.  Dutch Quigley confirmed that these deals were more than likely hedged
(although it is difficult to hedge 20 year deals since we are one of the few
playing out that far).  If we are under the assumption that we will be able
to transfer all hedges along with the deal(s), then these deals are not
underwater.  However, there will be some costs associated with transferring
the hedges.  When I get a better idea of these costs I will relay them to
you.
