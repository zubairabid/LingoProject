Group,
We have some changes regarding Enron Canada.

One...they have hired their own staff to handle the dispatching of the
Transalta units into and out of the pool.  We will still serve as a back-up
resource for questions from their new staff.  And some of their new hires
will be rotating down here to get a better understanding of what we do.

Two...as a result of having staff, they will be having more of an opportunity
to purchase transmission across BC to the US.  When this happens we typically
will have very little time to sell this power (mostly we get called on the
status of the power at the bottom).  However, please keep in mind that this
power is typically priced between $10 and $65 a mw.  If you have questions
regarding purchasing from Enron Canada please ask me.  We have told Canada
that there is no bid in the Northwest two different times now.  If there is
no bid for $65 power, lets communicate that to Canada before they spend money
on transmission.    If you have questions regarding purchasing from Enron
Canada please ask me.  Please do your best to improve communication and to
prevent these situations from happening again.
Thank you.
Bill
