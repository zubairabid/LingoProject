I spoke with Rob Foss this afternoon and he's under the impression that "Evie
and the Indicated Producers" (a new singing group) are not going to file a
rebuttal to PG&E's proposal for Wheeler Ridge.  He promised to circle back
with Burlington tomorrow and, like Regis Filbin, see if that's their final
answer.
