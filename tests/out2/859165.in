After learning that the goal posts had been greased at Texas Tech to keep
fans from tearing them down if the Red Raiders had beaten Texas, the
Longhorns got some more goal post bulletin board material from Kansas.

Texas coach Mack Brown told his team about a story that appeared in the
Topeka Capital-Journal on Oct. 23 about how Kansas players hoped they would
be tearing down the goal posts after beating Texas this Saturday.

At the time, KU players quoted in the article had hoped they would be
playing Texas for their sixth win, making them bowl eligible. As it stands,
the Jayhawks (4-5, 2-4) need to beat both Texas and Iowa State.

Still, that didn't keep Mack Brown from telling his team about the article.

"I think that's insulting," said UT CB Quentin Jammer. "They'll only be let
down when it doesn't happen."

"That's disrespectful," said UT CB Rod Babers. "It's the same thing as Tech
lubing up the goal posts."

Recalling that three teams (Baylor, Missouri and Oklahoma State) tore down
goal posts after beating a 4-7 UT team in 1997, coach Mack Brown called Texas
"the goal post team."

On a related note, Brown is taking all kinds of measures to make his team
tougher.

Texas players wore jackets and head warmers in the cold and rain in Dallas
against Oklahoma. They will be without such comforts when they travel to
Kansas this weekend, where temperatures could be in the 40s.

"When we played in the mist up in Dallas, the players had coats on and masks
on," Mack Brown said. "We've taken those away. We don't take jackets to the
game anymore when it's cold. No masks, nothing. We're going to go with pads
and helmets and play. We're not going to stand around and let the weather be
a factor."

Brown also wants his team to be up and ready despite playing to a crowd that
will likely be sparse at KU on Saturday.

"There won't be anybody there," Brown said, referring to the fact that KU
has averaged 33,220 fans at home this season.

KU's largest crowd at Memorial Stadium (capacity 50,250) was 48,500 for
Kansas State on Oct. 7.




Longhorn Q & A
Q: Since freshman DT Stevie Lee is out for the year now and he still has
redshirt eligibility, can he get a medical redshirt for his injury?
Rick Orr

BROWN:  Mack Brown said this week that the plan is for Lee (foot) to seek a
medical redshirt and thus have four years of eligibility after this season.

Shaun Rogers

Q: I know Shaun Rogers' play has been limited since his ankle sprain against
Houston. How many snaps has he been getting over the last several games? At
one point during the Tech game, I thought I saw Adam Doiron and Marcus Tubbs
on the field at the same time playing tackle. I know these freshmen are
playing great, but I figured either Shawn or Casey Hampton would always be on
the field to give the line the benefit of their experience. Please provide a
rundown of the tackle rotation.
Dan McCrory


BROWN:  Rogers has been getting between 20 and 30 snaps per game. But that
high ankle sprain has really taken a toll. He's not the same player he was
before the Houston game. Still, he wants to stay out on the field, even
though he is not 100 percent. Tubbs and Doiron were out on the field together
against Tech for several plays - several key plays. Mack Brown said Tubbs and
Doiron had the quickness to hold their own against Tech's inexperienced,
undersized offensive line. I don't know how often you'll see a tackle tandem
that doesn't include Casey Hampton, but against Tech, the coaches felt they
would have to play four defensive ends and four defensive tackles. That's
because of the number of pass rushers needed to get pressure on the QB.
Against a running team, you probably would see Hampton as part of the DT
tandem in the game.



Q: Can you update us on the injuries?
Lars Mechlenberg

BROWN:  Major Applewhite is out for Kansas with a sprained posterior
cruciate ligament in his right knee. He is questionable for Texas Aon Nov.
24. WR Artie Ellis (shin) is out for Saturday. CB Ervis Hill (shoulder) is
out for the season and may need surgery. DT Ryan Haywood (shoulder) is out
for the season and has already undergone surgery. SS Lee Jackson (quadriceps)
is questionable, and LB O.J. McClintock (knee) is probable. Coaches would
like to get McClintock back on the field this week on special teams.



Q: I noticed you mentioned in one of your articles that Texas was still
trying to put together its first complete game of the season. I couldn't
agree more. I don't recall a season where we really haven't played a good
game yet this late in the season, especially given the talent we are putting
on the field. I'm also concerned about the number of penalties we are
committing. I've read that Mack thinks these reflect enthusiasm and emotion,
but I watch too many teams play with as much or more emotion and remain
disciplined. Do you think we have a coaching problem or is it just youth?
Ken Hines, Wichita Falls

BROWN:  OG Antwan Kirk-Hughes told me this week that the team thought it
would go out to Stanford and win easily. In other words, the team took the
Cardinal lightly. Thus, when the Cardinal played the Longhorns tough (and
ultimately won), Texas got tight and struggled. I think this season has been
one with little to get up for. The teams on UT's schedule were - for the most
part - awful. Texas knew going into the season that it was going to be at
least a 10-point favorite in every game except for Oklahoma and Texas A&M.
The Longhorns have beaten only one team with a winning record - Texas Tech.
My point is, once Texas suffered the shock of losing to Stanford, it lost
some of its sense of urgency. Its dream of a national title - realistic or
unrealistic - was over. By the time Texas played Oklahoma, the Longhorns had
played only a couple halves of complete football - the second half against
Louisiana-Lafayette and the second half against Oklahoma State. That wasn't
nearly enough to build the kind of confidence needed to face the Sooners. For
whatever reason (some will argue it was the QB rotation), the offensive
coaches weren't able to instill an identity or swagger into their players.
Whether this is because of a lack of leadership on offense or because the
team couldn't get up for the Houstons and Baylors of the world, only the
coaches and players really know. But, in my opinion, Texas has not yet put a
complete game together - nine games into the season. And it's because of the
offense. The defense has been solid with the exception of Oklahoma. The
offense has been slow starting, erratic and even predictable. To UT's credit,
the offense is about to set a single-season passing yardage record by
averaging 289.4 yards passing per game. If Texas wins its next two games and
wins its bowl game, the Longhorns would be 10-2 and that would be an
improvement over last year and hard to argue with. So, perhaps Texas can take
the fire it showed in the first quarter against Tech and put its first
complete game together this week. A three-game winning streak to end the
season would be a great launch pad into next season, when UT will again have
a chance for greatness against a schedule of tackling dummies.



Q: I am thinking that palm trees and balmy sunsets may be in the Longhorns'
immediate holiday plans: either the Orange Bowl, if all goes perfectly, or
more likely the Culligan Holiday Bowl in San Diego. Do you think Mack Brown
would relish a game against Rick Neuheisel? Texas vs. Washington would make
for great TV, and a wonderful trip for the 'Horns and their many fans.
James K. Sterrett

BROWN:  This is a better question for next week because we'll know the
outcome of the Texas A&M-Oklahoma game. If Oklahoma and Nebraska both win out
and meet in the Big 12 title game, a narrow Nebraska win would probably land
both in a BCS bowl game. A narrow Oklahoma win might still land them both in
the BCS. But a lopsided win by either Oklahoma or Nebraska would probably
mean the winner going to a BCS bowl game and the loser going to the Cotton.
If Aloses to Oklahoma and UT beats Kansas, the winner of the UT-Agame would
probably be playing for the Holiday Bowl with the loser going to the Alamo
Bowl. The Holiday Bowl opponent would appear to be either Oregon State or
Washington. The Alamo Bowl opponent would appear to be either Michigan or
Ohio State. I think any of those opponents would probably catch the attention
of Texas, except for maybe Oregon State, which is really good.

Carl Reese

Q: Missouri head coach Larry Smith is probably on his way out of Columbia
after this season. Carl Reese is a perfect candidate for that position with
all of his Missouri ties. Do you see coach Reese taking off for Columbia?
Michael Sampson

BROWN:  Reese has indicated to Mack Brown that he has no interest in
becoming a head coach. He is getting close to 60, and I think he would like
to focus all of his efforts on building a national title contender in Austin.
Don't look for Reese to go anywhere.




Q: What is the status of Austin Sendlein? I never heard if he redshirted and
I have not heard of him playing.
David W. Rhodes

BROWN:  The Stanford player participation chart showed LB Sendlein playing.
But he has not played and will be redshirted this season. He is among a
handful of players redshirting who the veterans have said look really good in
practice. The other redshirts drawing raves are QB Chance Mock, RB Sneezy
Beltran, FB Will Matthews, WR Tony Jeffery and OL Lionel Garr.



Q: Is it me or do we get some really sorry calls  from the officials? It's
always been my opinion that referees' calls were  just part of the game and
if you're not good enough to overcome some bad  calls, well, you're just not
good enough. That said, however, we seem to  have some of the worst calls
going against us in the last few years and in  almost every game. Are the
officials held to any standard by the Big 12 or  an officiating group? If
it's not the officials, we have got to do something  about all these
penalties.
P.M., Midland

BROWN:  I, too, hate talking about penalties. But while Mack Brown can't
talk about the penalties being called because he'll be fined by the Big 12,
he can complain to the officials on the field. And he can send a videotape of
calls that he thinks are questionable to the league office. And let's just
say Brown has sent plenty of videotapes to the league office this season.
Brown is calling for instant replay in the college game. He said the NFL's
instant replay has shown how many calls are missed in a football game. He
hopes that schools will bite the bullet and vote in favor of this even though
it would be a sizable expense to most schools and would slow the game down.
Brown can't discuss the penalties that have been called on Texas this season,
but if he could, his face would be red, and he wouldn't be able to stop
talking.

Kenny Hayter

Q: Is there anything physically wrong with Kenny Hayter that is limiting his
playing time? Or is this just the coaching staff's decision? I will be one of
the many to admit that Hodges Mitchell and the offensive line have looked a
lot better over the past four games. If Hayter had better per-carry numbers
than Mitchell with an underperforming offensive line, it would seem to me
that Hayter would also do well now that they are blocking better. I would
like to point out that I do not advocate benching Mitchell by any means, but
after this week's game and all of the talk I have heard about him being
durable or not, I think that a more balanced backfield would help out in this
situation.
Jason Patton


BROWN:  The coaches have stuck with Mitchell because he is a senior leader
on an offense that doesn't have many leaders and because he is such a
versatile threat as a running back and receiver. Mitchell has suddenly
climbed within 235 yards of a 1,000-yard rushing season (765 yards) and has
337 yards receiving (he'll surpass last year's 343 yards receiving). Mitchell
has a 4.7-yard per carry average, the best on the team among RBs except for
Brett Robin, who has just five carries for 27 yards (5.4 yards per carry).
The coaches will stick with Mitchell from here on in because the offense
finally showed against Tech that it can gain rushing yards in the first half
of a game. Now, granted, it was against an undersized defensive line that
emphasized its quickness over bulk. But Mack Brown seems to think his team is
finally getting tougher and beginning to control the offensive line of
scrimmage. Kansas has a salty defensive line, led by NG Nate Dwyer (6-3,
300). So, we'll see if the Longhorns' offensive line can continue to push
people around.



Q: How does Major Applewhite's injury problems effect Chris Simms' possible
redshirt status for next year?
Monte Boothe

BROWN:  It's too early to tell. Mack Brown said he had a conversation with
Simms about redshirting next season but that the earliest it could seriously
be considered is after spring practice, if not next fall.


Q: It seems that many Horn fans are still in shock from the 63-14 debacle in
the Cotton Bowl and are wondering if OU is suddenly that far ahead of Texas
in the development of their respective programs. Are they? Or was this just a
total meltdown by a young UT team? Can we expect better results next year and
if so, why?
Mark, Lewisville

BROWN:  I think the OU coaches deserve a lot of credit for getting their
players to pull together and show the kind of effort they have on both sides
of the ball. That kind of coaching job is what it's all about. But I don't
think you can underestimate the influence that Josh Heupel has had on that
team. He makes every part of that offense effective. Tremendous credit goes
to the defensive coaches for getting their players to put the brakes on teams
like Texas, Kansas State and Nebraska. This has been a phenomenal coaching
job. And no disrespect to OU, but next year, without Heupel, I think they
will drop off slightly (maybe 8-3). Maybe not. But it seems likely.



Q: I thought Mack Brown's philosophy on redshirts is that he will take them
off ANY player at ANY point in the season if we need that player to help us
win. Does having Beau Trahan as the backup QB for Kansas give us a better
chance of winning the game (if Simms goes down) than Chance Mock? From what
Mack says, Mock is not even a consideration (since Courtnee Garcia is the
emergency QB).
Glen Shillinglaw, Austin

BROWN:  I think Brown is banking on the fact that Simms survives the Kansas
game and Major comes back to start or at least back up Simms in an emergency
situation against Texas A&M. On Tuesday, Mack Brown announced that Hunter
McWilliams, and not WR Courtnee Garcia, would be the team's third
quarterback. McWilliams, the son of former UT coach David McWilliams, runs
the scout team QB position in practice and has more experience handing off
this season than Garcia, who was an option QB at Lufkin. Brown said he would
take the redshirt off of Mock if he absolutely had to, meaning if both Simms
and Applewhite went down with season-ending injuries. But he said to do so
right now would be premature because Simms is OK, and there's a chance that
Applewhite will be back for A&M.



Q: Is there any chance for Texas to take the Big 12 South? Hopefully Abeats
OU this weekend, this can't hurt.

BROWN:  Oklahoma would have to lose two of its last three games at Texas
A&M, home against Texas Tech or at Oklahoma State. Texas would then have to
beat Kansas and Texas Ato win the Big 12 South. Texas Acan win the Big 12
South title by beating Oklahoma and Texas.
