Kim:
I hope Portland was successful.
I'd like to go ahead and schedule two lunch sessions with the
confirm/settlements group:  the first regarding basic financial
agreements/confirmations and format, lingo, etc (very general) and the second
more specific session addressing types of financial transactions and their
basic structures.  One day next week would be great and perhaps one or two
weeks after the first session for the followup.  Please send your dates and
list of attendees.
Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.
Thanks.  Sara
