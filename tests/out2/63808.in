We regret to announce that with the reduced emphasis on developing large
infrastructure projects in certain countries, a number of individuals have
elected to leave Enron.  Diomedes Christodoulou, formerly Chief Commercial
Officer of Enron Broadband Services, James Bannantine, formerly CEO of Enron
South America, and Sanjay Bhatnagar, formerly CEO of Enron Broadband Services
for the Middle East and Asia, have elected to leave Enron to pursue other
opportunities.  Diomedes, Jim and Sanjay built and led strong and talented
teams at Enron.  We wish all of these individuals the very best in their new
endeavors.
