Jason seemed excited about the concert.  I think  this is one of his
favorite bands.  I enjoy their music as well but not to the same degree as
my eldest sibling.
I am actually going to Dallas on Friday for the TX-OU game.  I am taking a
couple of friends from work, so it should be a good time ( it always is).
