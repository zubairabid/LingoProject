Sally,
Thanks for the email and update.  I agree that we must do something quickly
to resolve this.  I believe that you should interview for summer interns as
an extension to your upcoming planned recruiting trip.  I know you were very
happy with the summer interns from the energy management program at OU that
you got last year ( I was surprised and the school was thrilled  that you
offered all 5 permanent positions upon graduation).   We cant lose that
momentum.  I am sure that each school's program is different and that most
don't interview for summer interns this early in the year but from what I
have learned about the OU schedule, we will lose all the top candidates if we
wait.  I am sure that is not what Charlene and Celeste were trying to
accomplish with their guidelines.
Please keep me up informed on this matter.
Thanks and good luck with the students.
