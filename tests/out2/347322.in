We recently concluded an exercise to identify the top &ten8 objectives for
U.S./Canada Government Affairs for 2000, which I presented to the group at
the December 16 staff meeting.  Our success in achieving these objectives
will define the group,s success in the New Year.

Two of our top three objectives involve providing support to the Risk
Management group in EES.  Number 3 and Number 2 (one of the number 2,s) are,
respectively,

Ensure that PG&E,s generation-related stranded cost is &rolled off8 no
later than September 30, 2000 and generally protect and inform EES curves
Understand rules/tariffs/outcomes better than anyone else and convert to
information valuable to business units

As a general matter, it is imperative that we continue to assure ourselves
that our everyday efforts are focused on achieving the objectives that are so
critical to our success.  The way the group provides support to EES Risk
Management, and in turn achieves the objectives noted above, is one area
where there is potential to improve performance with a refocusing of efforts.

Toward this end, I am asking that these individuals take on the
responsibility, for their respective regional group, of being a point of
contact for EES Risk Management:

Mona Petrochko, Western Region  Kate Wagner, South Central/Southeast Region
Becky Merola, Great Lakes/Midwest Region Frank Rishe, Mid Atlantic/New
York/New England Region

Mona, Becky, Kate and Frank will work with individuals on the EES pricing
desk to improve the flow of information necessary for timely, accurate
utility rate curves and help EES develop strategies to improve the economics
of existing outsource deals.  I expect this activity will take a significant
portion of their time.  They will coordinate their efforts with Harry
Kingerski and Pat Keene who will continue to provide a centralized support to
EES Risk Management from Houston.

I recognize that many of you are called on from time to time to provide other
types of support to EES, for sales calls, licensing requirements,
environmental issues, legal support, and the like.  This change in no way
affects these other activities and you should continue to pursue those
efforts.

As a final note, I invite all of you to identify and bring to me ways we can
improve our chances of success in meeting any of our Year 2000 objectives.  I
am not interested in change just for its own sake but will certainly consider
doing things differently if our likelihood of success can be improved.

Best to you for the New Year!
