Here is a follow-up proposal from Professor Littlechild, after his San
Francisco/Tokyo trips.  He is inquiring as to whether we would want to retain
him to  do some rebuttal to Ruff/Hogan/et al on retail markets importance.  I
am not championing him, and both Nick and Jeff have had a chance to gain the
measure of the felow.  He has come to his views a bit belatedly, for a
regulator who was in the chair for 9 years, but over here he is a highly
respected academic, and I might still think about using him in Europe for
just this purpose.  His low-key style will go dwon well, and his views will
be respected.  Any use for this type of work in your markets, let's discuss.
Otherwise, I might let him know that he is free to consult for a Japanese
firm, which does not trouble me, as I think he holds views that would find
their way into Japanese thinking in a way that would be a net benefit for us,
rather than losing an ally.  Look forward to hearing from you.   thanks   mcs
