Vasant,
Vince and I spoke with Gary Hickerson and Michelle Cisneros about the
consultant's power plant model this afternoon. We will take their model's
interface and recode the calculation engine, incorporating useful insights
from the consultant. IT help will be available
via Gary's group.  So I will spend the next 4 weeks working on this.
