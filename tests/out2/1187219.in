Shari,

A few things:

1.  Apologies for not answering your message sooner but I have just returned
this week after a few weeks of vacation - and your e-mail (together with
about 300 others ) have only just arrived on my PC today owing to a glitch
which occurred with my machine whilst I was away.

2.  I have finished the due diligence on this - the first round was completed
some months ago and preliminary results were given to Mark Haedicke and Harry
Arora - not to Gary as I never knew that he was involved.  Out of that first
round of due diligence several questions arose which required to be bottomed
out and despite instructing Indian counsel in April on those additional
questions, they never actuallly finalised their advice on this aspect until a
few days before I went on vacation.  Anyway, that has now been done.

3.  I'm starting my secondment in Houston for two months from next Monday.
As I am trying to sort out things here today and tomorrow in preparation for
my absence from London, would you mind if  I gave you the full low-down on
this one early next week, face-to face??

Kind regards

Mark
