We interviewed the 12 finalists in Austin yesterday.   Interviewers were Gene
Humphrey, Thomas Suffield, Roger Ondrecko and me.  The four of us met this
morning in Houston to decide on our suggested scholarship receipients.  Based
on my conversation with Sue White yesterday in Austin, I called her today
with the names of the three suggested award winners.  I conveyed this via
voice mail, as Sue was not in her office.  She had told me that her schedule
would be tight today, so it is likely that she and I will talk tomorrow
morning.  She wanted to be able to discuss our recommendations.  I would not
anticipate any changes as a result of my pending conversation with Sue.
However, I think that it will be best to withhold the names of the recepients
until after that conversation.  She will most likely then contact you to
confirm their names.  I have phone numbers, addresses and e:mail addresses
for all three, and I will provide you with those as soon as the official
notification from the University takes place.

Gene, Thomas and Roger are all interested in attending the dinner in Austin
if schedules permit.  The week of April 24th is a good one for me for the
dinner.  Obviously, many schedules have to be coordinated.  I know that Rick
Causey will want to attend (he will have been in London the week prior, so he
may be available).  I have also talked with CIndy Olson and I know that she
would like to be included if her schedule permits.

Today was Brent's last day in the Houston office for several months.  Let me
know how I can help with these arrangements.
