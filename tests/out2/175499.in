Sorry.  Been a bit crazy around here.  Thanks for the note, and thank you for
doing such a good job at driving this process.  My thoughts on your proposal
(and these are very preliminary):  1) politicians may not be willing to go as
high as 25% for fear of being accused of a "utility bailout"--maybe 10-15%?
though utility solvency may force their hands.  2) TURN will go ape-#%#$ if
we make the "roll off" retroactive to October.  3) I'm willing to allow
utilities to collect TRA undercollections, but feel that customers and
utilities (not me) need to figure out precisely what that number is.
Look forward to getting closure tomorrow, though I'm very concerned that
we've lost Edison, given Bryson's public calls to return to 1950.
