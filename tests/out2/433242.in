Can you please delete access to the financial trading agreement database to
the following people:
Anita Fam
Brenda Whitehead
Elizabeth Sager
Jason Peters
Stephanie Sever
Christian Yoder
Lorraine Filomeno

Two people need to have their access changed from Legal Dept., to Credit
Dept. (therefore they can make Credit comments, not Legal comments):  Tom
Moran and Veronica Espinoza.
Also, please add a lawyer in our Group to the database with full edit
access:  Cheryl Nelson.
Thanks!
