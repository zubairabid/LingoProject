Dear Mark
Before they give their final confirmation that the game can go ahead in
Poland, our Polish lawyers would like me to forward to them some information
as to the critria Enron use to decide who can and can't trade online.  I
guess that they are wanting to know whether the criteria are basically
objective i.e based on credit ratings etc or whether they are more
subjective.  In practice, what sort of companies do Enron refuse online
trading access to?
Thanks
