I had a really big lunch, even cake, so now eating out of the fridge (if at
all) sounds ok.  I got a really nice bottle of white wine from Andrews &
Kurth.  I put it by the window to cool off.

I've worked with three trial lawyers from K & S, and they are really good.
However, K & S represents American Express.  Keffer tells me that you used a
guy at Bracewell that you liked, and that this person has now started their
own firm.  John drew a blank on the name, but will call me back with the name
and number.

Enron also likes Gibbs & Bruin, a litigation boutique in Houston. I believe
the main contact's name is Robin Gibbs, but that is also the name of one of
the Bee Gee's, so I could be wrong.  Can you check the internet and see?  If
not, I will look in a minute.

Love,

Kay
