The Sun Never Sets On Hydration

It's easy to overlook your hydration needs once summer's heat stops
antagonizing your workout. But don't be fooled into believing that you need
much less water in cooler temperatures. Everyone's need for water varies,
depending upon what you eat and how much you sweat, but a general rule is to
drink a quart of water for every hour of exercise you do. And of course,
that's in addition to the eight glasses you're already drinking daily.
