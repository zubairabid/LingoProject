Clement, Dan,
Below is an e-mail from my counterpart at Coastal with comments to the
revised Enron Corp draft that Clement provided to me in his e-mail on Dec..
21st.  Can each of you please review these concerns.  If the Master will not
be executed until after their merger with El Paso, I think it is OK to accept
a Unified guaranty cap instead of specifif limits.  I was origninally thought
the reason for the specific dollar limits was because of Contracts.
