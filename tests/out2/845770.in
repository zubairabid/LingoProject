I need ASAP-- South America is going home & they are off tomorrow ----Thanks,
kay


On November 8, the Office of the Chairman, issued an important communication,
announcing significant organizational changes in Enron's worldwide
operations. The purpose of this memo is to share with you the decisions that
are underway to restructure  Enron,s operations in South America.  The basic
organizational framework has been set.

As you know, Diomedes Christodoulou and Jim Bannantine will be assuming new
responsibilities within Enron. Replacing them will be Orlando Gonzalez and
Joe Kishkill, who will become the Co-Presidents of South America, reporting
to Dave Delainey and John Lavorato.  They will share overall responsibility;
however, Orlando,s focus will be on direct sales origination,
commercial/government relationships and regulatory issues.  Joe,s focus will
be on wholesale origination, financial and operating performance and overall
country management.  In addition, Orlando will continue as President and CEO
of Elektro until its ultimate sale.

The existing, large integrated asset base in South America (excluding
Elektro) will be managed and operated by Rebecca McDonald and Jim Hughes in
Enron Global Assets, which is part of Enron Wholesale Services under Mark
Frevert. Ultimately, there will be very close coordination in both Brazil and
Argentina between Enron Americas and Enron Global Assets to ensure that our
reputation in South America is protected, our asset positions are being
managed prudently and that commercial opportunities surrounding these assets
are pursued.

The remaining natural gas and electrical commercial activities in South
America will be organized around the highly successful North American network
business model.  This model employs people, market making, physical
commodities, capital and assets to provide reliable, flexible and high-value
products to our customers.  It is people and intellectual capital based and
enjoys high rates of return on invested capital.

In the interest of pursuing this strategy, the following teams will report to
Joe and Orlando:

The Commercial Origination team will be lead by Brett Wiggs.  The team will
focus on covering South American markets, primarily Brazilian and Argentine
natural gas and electricity, with the following goals:

Generating new, innovative, reliable and high value products and services
needed by the market by utilizing our commodity, asset and capital
capabilities;
Providing those products and services across South America and across the
value chain, including wholesale and retail, based upon the highest value
opportunity;
Finding structural value arbitrages in the South American market and move
quickly to capitalize;
Assisting the Risk Management and Trading organization in managing the
overall risk of the organization;
Managing all new power and asset development opportunities in South America
consistent with this strategy, and
Providing the Risk Management and Trading organization information and deal
flow.

The Commercial Origination team will consist of a diverse group of people who
work as a single team which bring the required skills including commodity,
capital, regulatory, asset, development, market, structuring, deal execution,
finance and country knowledge necessary to reach our goals.

The Trading and Risk Management team will be headed by Remi Collonges.  The
team will continue to develop pricing information and manage the price book
for the relevant energy markets in support of the wholesale and direct sales
efforts.  Additionally, the team will work toward implementation of actively
trading South American energy commodities.  This group will be responsible
for managing Enron South America,s overall risk and will have a direct
reporting relationship with John Lavorato in his role as head of the Americas
risk activities.

The Argentine effort will be integrated into the overall South American
Commercial Origination and Trading and Risk Management groups; however, we
will continue to maintain an Argentine office headed by Michael Guerriero.

The goal of the reorganization is to create a flat team oriented organization
that is very market and commercially focused.  The following support
functions will assist the overall business objectives of the commercial team
and will report into Joe and Orlando, plus into their line functions in
Houston.  The overall goal is to ensure that the South American business
units have an adequate support organization to evaluate opportunities, as
well as manage day-to-day business and risk.  Otherwise, the Houston
infrastructure will provide resources as needed to manage peak requirements
in South America, not unlike other businesses in Enron Americas.

These groups include:

The Government Affairs team, which will be headed by Sergio Assad, will
manage the relationships with the relevant regulatory agencies as well as
governmental ministries.  The primary regulatory goal will be to facilitate,
in the near term, substantive changes to the regulatory rules to allow a
functioning wholesale traded market in Brazil and Argentina. Sergio will
assume his responsibilities upon completion of the Elektro sale.  During this
interim period, Jose Bestard will continue to be in charge of the regulatory
function.  Once Sergio makes the transition, he will also report to Rick
Shapiro in Enron Government Affairs.

The Finance team will be headed by Britaldo Soares.  The team will manage the
interface with Enron Global Finance.  Britaldo will transition from his
current duties at Elektro upon completion of the Elektro sale.  Britaldo will
also report to Joe Deffner in Enron Global Finance.  Rob Gay will be
assisting Britaldo during the transition, while continuing his work on the
Cuiaba project.

The Legal team, which will be lead by Randy Young, as general counsel, and
John Novak, as deputy general counsel, will manage South America,s legal
requirements.  Randy and John will also report to Mark Haedicke in Enron
Wholesale Services - Legal Department.

Miguel Padron will become Chief of Staff.  Human Resources, Information
Technology, Treasury, Accounting & Reporting, as well as Administration will
report to Miguel.  This will bring focus to essential, but non-commercial
functions, as well as more efficiently manage key matrix reporting
relationships with Enron.  Miguel will also report to David Oxley in Enron
Wholesale Services ) Human Resources and Wes Colwell in Enron Wholesale
Services ) Business Analysis and Reporting.

These changes are consistent with Enron's evolving business strategy and
reflect our continuing commitment to grow the company by maximizing our
financial and intellectual capital.  However, in line with the new
organizational structure and the near term potential for business in the
region, further budget reductions will be necessary.  People directly
affected will be notified shortly.

Enron is committed to continue the successful implementation of its
businesses in South America.  We believe that as the markets develop, we are
uniquely positioned to leverage Enron,s core capabilities and create
shareholder value.
