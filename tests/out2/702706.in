Dear Kimberly,

I'd like to extend a special thanks to you for being one of Hotwire's first
air travel customers.  I hope you enjoyed your travel-buying experience at
Hotwire - and I look forward to building a lasting relationship.

The best is yet to come at Hotwire.  We've dedicated ourselves to making our
service even better. Technical and customer service enhancements are
currently underway to ensure our site is reliable and easy to use.
Additionally, we will be extending Hotwire's travel savings to international
flights, hotels and rental cars in the near future.

Our mission is to make it easy for you to save money on travel by providing
great deals on the best brands.  Please feel free to drop me a line at
karl.peterson@hotwire.com to tell me how Hotwire can better achieve this
goal. Once again, thank you for your support.  I hope that you'll return to
Hotwire to let us save you more money on future travels.

Happy travels,
Karl Peterson
