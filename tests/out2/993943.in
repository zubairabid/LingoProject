QUALCOMM Announces ICC Arbitration Decision Regarding Royalty Dispute
with ETRI

SAN DIEGO, Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq:QCOM)
today announced that the International Court of Arbitration (ICA) of the
International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) has issued its decision and award
arising from the arbitration between QUALCOMM and the Korean Electronics and
Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI).

As a result of the award by the ICC, QUALCOMM will report, in its first fiscal
quarter of 2001 ending in December 2000, a one-time charge of approximately
$80
million for additional royalties to be shared with ETRI as well as interest
and
other costs for the period from inception of the Joint Development Agreement
between the parties in 1992 to September 27, 2000. In addition, the ICA
ordered
that QUALCOMM continue to share with ETRI a part of the royalties that
QUALCOMM
receives only on sales of certain Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
equipment
for use in Korea. The continuing payments ordered in the ICA decision are
expected to have little impact, on the order of $4 million per quarter
depending
on the sales of phones and infrastructure in Korea, on the revenues and
earnings
of QUALCOMM in future quarters.

"While we are disappointed by the ICA's decision, we continue to look forward
to
receiving strong royalty revenues from sales of CDMA equipment in Korea," said
Louis M. Lupin, senior vice president and general counsel of QUALCOMM. "The
ICA's decision does not in any way affect QUALCOMM's ability to collect
royalties on CDMA, WCDMA or other CDMA-based standards, and has no impact on
the
ability of QUALCOMM to collect royalties from sales of CDMA equipment in
Korea."


The Company is evaluating its options with respect to the award.

QUALCOMM Incorporated (www.qualcomm.com) is a leader in developing and
delivering innovative digital wireless communications products and services
based on the Company's CDMA digital technology. The Company's business areas
include integrated CDMA chipsets and system software; technology licensing;
Eudora(R) email software for Windows(R) and Macintosh(R) computing platforms;
digital cinema systems; and satellite-based systems including portions of the

OmniExpress(TM). QUALCOMM owns patents that are essential to all of the CDMA
wireless telecommunications standards that have been adopted or proposed for
adoption by standards-setting bodies worldwide. QUALCOMM has licensed its
essential CDMA patent portfolio to more than 90 telecommunications equipment
manufacturers worldwide. Headquartered in San Diego, Calif., QUALCOMM is
included in the S&P 500 Index and is a 2000 FORTUNE 500(R) company traded on
The

Except for the historical information contained herein, this news release
contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and
uncertainties,
including the Company's ability to successfully design and have manufactured
