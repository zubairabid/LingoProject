Jeff,
Sorry, I didn't realize we were attacking this one early over the holiday,
and I was out of town
until this afternoon. My conclusions differed from the attached write up on a
few points, but I am
not certain my thinking is the correct way. Here goes:
On the expropriation:
In the write up we say "We agree with the executive that Global should report
the expropriation
contingency in its 1994 report since both conditions included in FASB #5 were
met:  1) sufficient
information to assess that a loss is probable and 2) the loss could be
reasonably estimated.
Matuto took power in 1994 and it was known that he would nationalize major
industries.  "
The book says "The imminence of an expropriation may be indicated by a public
or private
declaration of intent by a government to expropriate assess of the enterprise
or actual
expropriation of assets of other enterpises." I would argue that Matuto was
not the government and
therefore unable to enforce these assertions when he was running for office.
It also says FASB 5
requires the two accrual criteria to be met.
As I understand it, the government took over sometime last year and
nationalization of resources
was part of their platform. However, the announcement occured in mid-Feb 1995
that the government
intends to nationalize the mining industry. Also, the taking over of the
telephone company took
place in January. Since both of these events happened in 1995, I would think
they should not accrue
in 1994 because the asset was not actually impaired in 1994, in fact the
asset was fully functional
and operational for the entire financial reporting period. I believe they
should disclose that the
possibility of expropriation exists in 1994, but I think they should not
accrue..
I disagree that the company should cease use of the patent infringing
technology, I believe that
companies frequently make conscious business decisions to infringe upon
patents. Since I agree that
an accrual is not in order, perhaps a general disclosure regarding patent
litigation should be
made.
The book states that "If there are several aspects of litigation, each of
which gives rise to a
possible claim, then the accrual criteria should be applied to each possible
claim...."
Thus I think we should break up the product liability suit into pieces.
They've agreed to pay 1M
for lost rentals. This should clearly be accrued, assuming it hasn't been
paid yet. The tenants
claims are expected to be settled for 1M, this too should be accrued. The
surrounding property
claims are not estimable, and therefore should be handled with a disclosure.
