Ranelle,
I'm sorry I didn't get back to you sooner on this.  I do have some questions
regarding the attached notice.  What is the counter-offer methodology and
when will we use it vs. FCFS.  Our tariff currently allows us to use the NPV
methodology and does not state that we can use an alternate methodology.
We need to rewrite the tariff provision.  Until then, we should definitely
post the alternate methodology that we plan to use for at least 3 business
days in advance.  Drew and Susan and I are supposed to meet on this subject
today.  I will get their thoughts as well.  thanks, Maria
