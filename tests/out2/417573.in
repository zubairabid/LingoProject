Tana, thanks for expediting this Tana. The list for Australian weather is
fine. As I mentioned I will be following up with credit on the collateral
requirementsfor some counterparties. On Japanese weather I would suggest we
do not load up the following Ergon, Macquarie Generation and Snowy . These
are government power utilities and their ability to trade in products not
linked to their business is limited. Hence they should be only trading
Australian power and weather.
Also I would ask that Citipower be restricted to Australian power and
weather. They are a Trust and the Trust Deed  grants the trustee the power to
trade devivatives to hedge its Australian power operations. I would like to
check this one out further.
