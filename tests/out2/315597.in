I've worked with Kilpatrick Stockton's North Carolina office quite a bit,
mostly regulatory- they are so so.  It is my understanding that the Atlanta
office messed up a simple thing for Lisa, and that's all I know about them.
I've worked extensively with King & Spalding, both their Houston office
(multiple matters) and Atlanta (two matters), and have had good results.
I've always worked through John Keffer in Houston, who then hooked me up with
the right folks in Atlanta.
