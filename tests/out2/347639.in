Kelly:

Thanks for the quick turn-around.

The positions we have in the Qs and As have been used for 2 years -- in India
by Sanjay, Europe, US, everywhere!!  Many people, including Rob B. have seen
these positions.  Rob's central concern is with respect to the science ( a
position which I do not argue and STRONGLY believe that Enron should not
argue since we are not scientists and have no general interest in getting
involved, as a company, in scientific arguments).

The positions articulated in the Qs and As are good for Enron's commercial
ventures which I am heading and I believe Rob has nothing to say about what
Enron staff are doing to pursue their parochial commercial interests; this is
a pure business decision.  This intrusion to shape positions that benefit the
Sutton-blessed business would be strongly resisted by me.

Please see the attached.  As you know, Ken was in Davos.  Look at this
summary that came directly off of the Davos web site -- climate change was
seen by business leader at Davos as the greatest challenge during the next
century.  Our middle-of-the-road position was the mainstream Davos CEO
position!
