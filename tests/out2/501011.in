Parviz, complete information to answer your
questions is not part of our current systems at
ERCOT.  The operational systems do not
archive/retain data.  We are looking into what
information we can gather but this may take some
time.
For the cost questions the only available data is
redispatch for unplanned and planned service.  It
is posted in accounting reports and is available
on the Internet at the following address:
ftp://ftp.ercot.com/unplannd/redispth/uredispt.htm
l
ftp://ftp.ercot.com/planned/redispth/redispth.html
Realignment is at owner's cost and ERCOT does not
receive/collect this information.  It will be very
hard to determine total impact without this
information.
Steve Myers, Security Operations Manager and his
staff are looking into available data to answer
the operational questions.
Some information relating to unplanned
transactions is available in the "Monthly
Transmission Market Operations Reports"  available
on the Internet at the following address:

In addition, past performance of the system does
not denote future performance.  Generation and
transmission are changing on the system every
year. Traditional methods of analysis using known
generation resources and pairing them with known
load are no longer possible.  There is significant
uncertainty in the existing generation that will
be displaced by the addition of new generation.
There is significant uncertainty regarding  how
their operation affects existing resources and the
transmission system.  The CSC calculations we
provided are trying to simulate these possible
transactions and determine the limitations with
the ERCOT stakeholders.
