Please take a gift card from the tree in the lobby and help us give our
adopted family a very happy holiday!   I noticed some of the cards did not
say sizes.  The mother wears size 10 in clothes and 6 1/2 in shoes.  Kassi
wears a size 10 in girls' clothes and size 2 1/2 in shoes.  Josh wears a size
10 in boys' clothes and a size 2 1/2 in shoes.



Also - Please raid your kitchen for extra cans of food or other
non-perishable items.  If we each bring in three items, our family will be
well fed this holiday season!

This is also a great way to teach your children about giving.  Let them help
with the shopping, or even donate part of their allowance to the cause.

Thanks for your help in making this holiday season bright for people who are
less fortunate than ourselves.

If you have questions about gifts, let me know.  Thanks.  Teri Whitcomb X
