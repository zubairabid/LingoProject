Shippers Protest KMI's Order 637 Tariff Changes

Kinder Morgan Interstate Gas Transmission (KMI) has attempted an end run
around FERC's Order 637,
filing wide-ranging operational and rate changes early under expedited tariff
procedures to avoid the
more rigorous review in store for compliance filings, according to customer
protests.

Items in KMI's tariff filing fall into no less than 13 general categories,
Indicated Shippers said. They include
imbalance provisions, storage balances, small customer service, gas quality,
point allocations, curtailment
priorities, right of first refusal, scheduling priorities, incidental
purchase and sale, capacity release,
unauthorized gas, capacity rights overrun charge, and miscellaneous.

Indicated Shippers called for summary rejection or maximum suspension of
KMI's June 5 tariff filing (RP00-316),
saying "most of the changes proposed in this case represent an effort by KMI
to implement elements of
Order 637 selectively and in a manner designed to minimize the opportunity
for meaningful review and
comment by KMI's customers." Only 12 days are allowed for intervention and
comment on usually routine
tariff filings, while the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has allotted
30 days for comments on
Order 637 compliance filings. KMI was among the group of pipelines slated to
make compliance filings June 15.

KMI said its filing did not constitute its compliance filing, but was aimed
at changing its tariff to reflect "the
current natural gas business climate and evolving business practices.." It
did acknowledge, "A number of the
changes proposed herein are consistent with and advance the Commission's
goals in Order No. 637."

Indicated Shippers also protested changes that would make decisions regarding
negative storage imbalances
and end of season inventory swaps a matter of KMI's discretion without any
standards on how those decisions
would be made. The shippers also protested changes to the default methodology
for point allocations for billing
purposes, and the injection of KMI discretion into the formula for accepting
or rejecting predetermined allocation
agreements with upstream or downstream parties. In addition curtailment
provisions filed by KMI appear to be
contrary to Order 637-A's mandate that shippers moving gas within the primary
path should have primary rights.

The filing also would give the pipeline the opportunity to bottle up
significant quantities of coal bed methane gas
in Wyoming's Powder River Basin by imposing more rigorous standards on
nitrogen content, according to
Western Gas Resources. A key change would impose a nitrogen gas quality
specification of 3% by volume.
While KMI states the change is necessary to accommodate transfers with
interconnecting pipelines, six of the
seven connecting pipelines identified have no nitrogen specifications. Only
KMI's affiliate, Natural Gas
Pipeline Co. of America, has similar rules, Western Gas said.

"KMI's proposed nitrogen specification would enable KMI to refuse to accept
coal bed methane production for
transportation, thereby foreclosing the availability of one of the principal
means of downstream pipeline egress
out of Powder River production areas," Western Gas added. Producers would
have to shut in production while
they construct costly nitrogen facilities. This could "create at least a
temporary gap in the downstream
movement of coal bed supplies to mid-continent and eastern markets, thus
frustrating consumer access to
these significant supplies."
