Hi,

Just a reminder for those who have not picked up their Fall 2000 schedule
titled, "Tele-BEARS Confirmed Class Schedule," at our office (S460) please
come in and do so.  There's a special Associated Students of the University
of California membership card on it.  This ASUC card may entitle you to
special discounts and promotions throughout the year!  Wow.

We know you want it.

Also parking passes, for those who requested them, can be picked up at our
office.

Thanks.
