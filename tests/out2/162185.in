I am available for a conference call 9/18 at 5PM eastern.
What concerns me about the competition is that their publicity is already
out, even though their date is 3 weeks after ours. We have to get ours out,
and that commits us to a hefty expenditure. While we have lots of
encouragement, we have practically no firm commitments of financial
sponsorship or speaker acceptances. We need both ASAP.
I have heard of no turndowns either of financial sponsors or of speakers,
but we need to secure the commitments. I think Loretta Lynch has confirmed,
as has Phil Harris. I am expecting a confirm from Stephen Littlechild
through Severin. I am awaiting a preliminary response about John Bryson. I
have not heard anything about any of the other speakers we agreed to seek,
so if any of you have information about these please pass it along.
Assuming we get a good "core" of our top picks for speakers, I am hoping
that we can get firm financial commitments from our loyal backers to give us
the "core" financial support that makes doing all of this possible.
