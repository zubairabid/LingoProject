The house thing is a tough call.  It's hard to say.   If you're not in any
hurry to buy, the summer should give
you a good indication of continuing energy problems.  I personally think that
the problem will come and go
for a while, but a lot depends on how California's legislature deals with the
situation.  I have no idea what
they'll end up doing - they've acted pretty poorly already.

What's your time frame on a house?  If you're only concern is that prices are
at their highest level in the last
decade, I wouldn't worry too much about that.  It's impossible to time the
market -  who would've thought
San Francisco's housing prices would be at these current levels.   There are
also a lot of intangibles associated
with home ownership as your aware of.

I would be concerned about the energy situation, so just try to keep abreast
of it.  Also, you could call me if you
have any questions.  I'll try to help the best I can.  Take care and tell Kim
and Kendall I said hi.
