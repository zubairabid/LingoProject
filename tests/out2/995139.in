Ben,
Are you loking more for focused refresher work?
I can certainly try and get something set up. The main problem I may have is
staffing.
I will send out an email to my GMAT instructors and find out if my really
good teachers have any time outside of their jobs and teaching. Evenings are
best? How about your weekends? When are you planning on re-testing?
I will return your call as soon as I can. We are a little short staffed so I
am on the phone a bit more than normal.
Thanks!
Amy
