Dear Jeff:

Thanks very much for agreeing to write for the journal.  As I mentioned during our phone conversation, we intend to profile some of the Wharton Alumni and their recommendations for success in one's career.  I heard you talk during the pre-term on this topic and thought it would be appropriate to launch this section with your profile.  This is especially topical and relevant considering the rather brutal DIP week (Dedicated Interview Period) we had just this past week.

The Journal is published every Monday and we normally try to get the articles before Friday for inclusion.  Please let us know what time frame best suits your convenience.  We would plan the launch of this new section accordingly.

Once again, thanks very much for your enthusiastic support.

Best Regards,
Ram Vittal
