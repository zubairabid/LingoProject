Jeff - This has been a textbook "nice guys finish last" experience for over
one year. The project is slipping away from us as is our reputation. We need
to devise an aggressive plan immediately to get those recalcitrants at PG&E
and their mouthpieces to understand that Enron means business.
Our record with the UC/CSU contract is already marginal, and by kowtowing to
those utility-types we will blow it altogether.
Unless I am missing a bigger picture issue, you need to tell me how we can
escalate this issue to the highest level at PG&E and the CPUC. I can't
imagine a $42 billion outfit being afraid of a bunch of wire and pipe guys.
As a former PG&E manager I know who was given attention and it wasn't the
meek. I am inclined to go with a recommendation by Jim Trudeau that we start
raising hell.
CSU Fresno is ready to escalate to Sacramento (read President Welty,
Chancellor Reed, Gov. Davis) upon our command. We need a parallel effort.
Tom Riley and I would like to discuss with you on Friday.
