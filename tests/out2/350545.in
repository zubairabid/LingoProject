Please read the proposal below from an excellent ghost writer and
presentation consultant from the White House Writers Group.  Steve Kean
suggested looking into this for some fresh ideas to improve our presentations.

We can have a session where we share with them some of our presentations and
they give us ideas for humor and personalization.  A question is whether this
would work for internal audiences such as all-employee meetings as well as
external ones.  Once we understand their methodology and capabilities, we
might find we can do some of this ourselves, and we would consult with them
on an as-needed basis for future presentations.

If you are interested in this seminar, let me know if you have a presentation
that they could review to make suggestions with and pick a possible date for
a seminar--say Monday December 4th or Tuesday the 5th?  I will forward this
to the EES and EBS presentation folks, but let me know who else might be
interested.
