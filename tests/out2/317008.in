I'm out of the office until around 1000 cst, but I'll call.  In the
meanwhile, please have the draft revised to reflect this payment arrangement.
This stuff is going fast and furious, and an executed ESA contract will be
required for ESA closing their financing on the 13th.  That's why it is first
in line.  We will need to start on a facility agreement for a project known
as the Fountain Valley project (aka PSCO).  Also, I'm going to try to get ABB
focused on doing their facility agreements.
I've asked the commercial team to prepare an update spread sheet for the
turbines to confirm the payment terms.  I hope to have it this am.
What is your direct line?
