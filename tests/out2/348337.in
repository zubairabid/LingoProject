Rebecca McDonald's APEC speech was a great success, with wide interest from
the audience.  Among others, DOE and EIA officials, the Korean Minister of
MOCIE, the Japanese Vice Minister of MITI and the Colombian Minister of Mines
and Energy all made special requests for copies of her presentation.  We are
making arrangements to distribute it to the broader audience today.  The
government and regulatory team here is already leveraging the enthusiasm for
the speech in their contacts.  Attached is the final copy of the
presentation, which reflects last minute changes.
