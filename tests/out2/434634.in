Tom -

Attached for your review are drafts of the NDA and Beta Test Agreement for
Dynegy Marketing & Trading.  If these meet with your approval, please forward
to Dynegy for their review.

I will be out of the office this afternoon, but reachable by cell phone
(713-466-3937).  If you should need anything on these documents, please do
not hesitate to call me.
