With the extension of the PRC to all organizations, questions have arisen
about the results of this process. This memo provides some details about the
PRC process.

First some context:  The key to Enron,s success is the increasing quality and
dedication of our talent.  As we continue to attract and retain the very best
people, we all have continued to raise the performance bar throughout the
organization.  At the core of our system are the following principles:

Hire the best people.
Provide challenging opportunities.
Pay well ( and pay for performance (with bonuses based on merit, not
entitlement).
Evaluate performance through a rigorous review process.
Provide clear feedback and direction to employees.

The PRC is a critical component of our performance management system.  The
PRC is built on this foundation:

360 degree performance feedback.
Review by a broad group, not just the supervisor.
A relative ranking of performance across Enron to determine promotions and
to allocate bonus money.


In addition to understanding this broad philosophy, we all need to understand
the following details:

Relative ranking.  Enron uses the descriptors &superior8, &excellent8,
&strong8, "satisfactory", &needs improvement8, and &issues8 to group all
employees.  This year, &relative to his/her peers8 precedes each of these
descriptors. This qualifier confirms what we have done and will continue to
do in practice; that is, evaluate individual performers against their peers.
It is possible, therefore, for someone to perform at the same or higher level
compared to prior periods, yet receive a lower rating for the current period
if other employees, performance raised the bar.
Teamwork.  A relative ranking may invite the view that for one employee to
gain, others must suffer.  However, feedback is explicitly solicited on
teamwork when evaluating each individual,s performance.  Anyone who attempts
to gain by withholding information or refusing to collaborate with others in
the organization will suffer in a relative ranking on this key performance
criterion.
Preferred distribution. In large part, the quality of our workforce has
been driven by our willingness to make tough decisions. We have consistently
captured business opportunities and overcome obstacles because we have made
the choices that had to be made in order to constantly improve our employee
talent base. The preferred distribution (5% superior, 30% excellent, 30%
strong, 20% satisfactory, and 15% needs improvement or issues) forces PRC
committee members to identify those who must improve in order to remain at
Enron as well as to single out top talent for special recognition. There is
some flexibility in the system, but every organization must ultimately face
this difficult question: have we achieved the highest level of performance or
are there still improvements that must be made? Few, if any, organizations
adhere exactly to the preferred distribution. Rather, they exercise informed
discretion in the individual categories and meet a distribution that reflects
their groups, overall effectiveness and need for improvement.
Communicating Ratings. Everyone rated &satisfactory8 or below should know
his/her rating. Each organization has determined for itself whether to
communicate ratings of &strong8 and above.  In all cases, employees will
receive feedback about their performance against expectations, areas of
success, and areas that need improvement.

We hope this answers most of your questions about the PRC process.  We would
like your feedback and ideas on how to improve the PRC process going
forward.  Therefore, we will be conducting an eSpeak in the near future, and
there will be other methods we will create to let us know what you think.  In
the meantime, please feel free to consult with your HR Generalist if you have
any immediate questions, comments, or concerns.
