Sara,
The version you distributed yesterday does not include the comments that I
sent to Scott Sefton last week.  Attached are my revisions.  You can feel
free to distribute to the broader group if you want.  I will get comments
from Rodney Faldyn and Bob Butts and then would like to distribute to LJM for
their review and execution.  Let me know if there are any outstanding
comments and/or issues.
Regards,
