Beyond The Numbers

When will the Election madness come to an end?

The U.S. presidential election was held 6-weeks ago. Since then
there has been plenty of speculation on who will be the next president
of United States. Each passing day this matter has gotten more
complicated causing the nation to become increasingly frustrated with
the entire situation. Traders convey the message that the financial
markets have reached a point where the outcome of this election, in
either direction, will have very little effect on the markets. As one
frustrated trader said &Mostly markets are looking for an end to this
matter, not many care at this point who the next president will be8.
We believe the initial reaction to the outcome will be mixed. However,
as the cloud clears, markets should be able to find a clear direction
from there. As of Tuesday night it appears the Texas Governor
George Bush will most likely be the next president.

Even negative news is boosting stock prices

Just a few weeks ago, no news was good news for US financial
markets. Readers may recall even when there was positive news
announcements made by companies, stocks continued to trade
lower. However, in the past few trading sessions we have highlighted
many better-known names warnings about the upcoming quarterly
earnings and about their entire year,s outlook. Interestingly enough,
following the &bad &news most of these stocks have rallied to recover
some of the recent losses. We are still confused about this reaction
and trying to make sense of it all. This interesting development brings
back some important memories. Some time ago (12-15 months ago)
we pointed out that some of the better known money managers left
the business or were forced out because they too could not make
sense or understand what was taking place in the market back then.
Of course, the entire street is aware of what has happened to the
Nasdaq in last 8-months.

Others with many decades of experience in the markets have voiced
similar opinions. Some of the smartest people in Wall Street like
Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway, Hedge fund manager Julian
H. Robertson, and fund manager George Soros also find it difficult
to make sense of the market reaction to the negative news. What's
puzzling is the fact these companies are steadily moving higher
despite the companies loosing money. We believe it is worth pointing
out or at least taking a closer look at before blindly joining the crowd.



Sector Analysis

Another big name warns

Tuesday after the close one of the better-known names in the PC world,
Compaq Computer (CPQ) warned the company,s earnings would fall
short of analysts, expectations. Following this earnings warning, the
box maker's stock briefly dipped down to $19  before bouncing back
to finish the session around $20. Given this is the third box maker to
pre-announce negative earnings, it may be worth watching the
component manufacturers who make the parts that go into the
computers. Some of the tech stocks worth watching closely are disc
drive makers, memory producers, modem, network card/network
suppliers, audio/video and other component makers.

Dow Transports may stall around 3000

In the past few sessions we wrote about transportation stocks benefiting
from lower crude oil prices. Some of the best performers within the
sector were airlines and railroads. As we are approaching the critical
resistance level of 3000, we like to alert readers to watch for possible
profit taking. Tuesday Transportation index traded as high as 2,970
before settling at 2,905. Tuesday,s move up put the index at a 7-month
high. If the crude oil prices stays around the current levels or move
lower, Transportation index may challenge the resistance level and
move higher if the markets as a whole moves higher.
