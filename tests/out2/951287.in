Enron Corp.

Gentlemen,
Thank you for the opportunity to learn about a new  communication position
within your group.Based on our discussions,  here are some initial
thoughts/observations on the job and the  task.

*Daily email newsletter for primarily two  audiences:
1. internal for employees available via the Enron
intranet
2. external for clients, industry at large

*Also suggest the newsletter be sent to a  targeted group of trade press. As
this information tool builds  momentum and credibility, it will support the
leadership positioning  ofEnron's Trading Group. Plus, it could become a
driver for  media inquiries andrequests for further information or
interviews with  Enrontrading experts.

*I heard you wanting internal and external  versions for both morning and
afternoon distribution.That  is an aggressive set of daily mailings. I
would want to review the scope of the  content and look at the frequency.
Just like print  publications,email newsletters arenow the rage and too
many  arelanding in the email inboxes.My counsel would be to start  with a
manageable number and do it well.You can always increase  frequency.
Difficult to cut back on frequency without it appearing as a  take away or
lack of commitment to the product. Staffing?

*Invite outside industry analysts or  clients to provide commentary.

*Consider developing an "editorial advisory  board" to govern the
content.Traders,legal  department, communications dept. A
multidisciplinary group thatcan add  value to the publication.

*Suggest finding an IMS or IT resource from  within Enron to be assigned to
this communications  effort.Database set up for the email addresses,
technical  issues ariseforcreating the links etc. Managing an
e-newsletter in my current position, I cantell you that a writer/editor  has
enough to do to compile content.You want mailings to go off  without any
glitches. Or if there are glitches, he or she cansolve  quickly. What are
the implications of these mailings on the company's  computer systems?

*Budget. Although not a  typical print publication, this effort should have
a budget. Graphics,  freelance or contract writing, photographyany special
software or hardware  needs associated with this effort?

*Review process. What is the  review process forthis publication. Legal
guidelines?  Corporate guidelines with regards to style, graphics
etc.Technical  review of the material for accuracy? A clear policy should
be  establishedup front for the review process so everyone involved knows
and  understands their role and responsibilitiestowards this communication
effort.

*Have you surveyed what is out in the  marketplace?Gather samples
ofnewsletters that you  like or don't like for discussion purposes.

*Measurement/evaluation of the  newsletter.Howwill the effectiveness of
the  newsletter be measured? Hits on the website. Inquiries from  clients?
Don't have a quick answer butsome goals should be set to  measure against.

*Maintenace of the mailing lists should  reside with the individual groups
participating in the  newsletter.Maintenance of the newsletter databases
should  not be the responsibility of the communications representative.

This sent to you in the spirit of exploring the position further.  Look
forward to your feedback.Thank you for your  consideration.

Sincerely,
Susan V. Gonzalez
