Beyond The Numbers

Are the markets ready for a rally?

Whether the markets are ready for a bounce or a sustainable rally is a topic
that can probably be argued for a long time to come. Some may argue the
fundamentals may or may not be in place for a reversal. While others may
argue the markets are due for a bounce because of the oversold condition.
Then there are those few, including RealTimeTraders.com who believe it's a
good idea not to fight the markets and simply go with the flow.

Important factors may be coming together for a move up

Notice, our heading states &a move up8 rather than a rally. Along with a few
market analysts we are not so sure this move up will be a definite reversal
or a temporary bounce that many traders are looking for in next few sessions.
Last week we pointed out that Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan finally gave
the markets what they had been anticipating. His favorable comments were
interpreted to be a sign of possible lowering of interest rates to help the
economy from slowing down to undesirable growth levels.

Last Friday Labor Department announced the November employment numbers were
below the consensus estimates. Over the weekend we learned that Iraq will be
back in the crude oil market. If Iraq's crude comes online, that may further
pressure the crude oil prices, (which is in the best interest of US
consumers). The fact this election drama is also getting close to an end is
also a positive for the markets. All the above facts coupled with the usual
year end rally (better known as Santa Claus rally) may set the stage for a
meaningful move up in the last few weeks of the year 2000.

Economic slowdown may impact future earnings

Last week some of the biggest and well-known names warned their upcoming
quarterly earnings will fall short of Wall Street,s expectations. Despite the
earnings warnings, markets have started to rally on the FED Chairman,s
comments about possibly lowering interest rates to stimulate or stop the
economy from slowing down. While lower rates are expected to help the markets
move higher, it is important to note that corporate earnings will not
immediately start to move higher. Given that, we believe markets are likely
to move in a range for some time before starting to pick up pace. Moreover,
unlike the past when dot com businesses rocketed higher and higher despite
losing more money, stock prices in the future will depend a lot on the
companies future earnings.
<br><br>
We encourage our readers to take a closer look at companies' earnings power
and their position within the sector. What we mean by that is, it is a good
idea to stay with the leaders in each sector rather than any stock that is
moving higher, a good example of that is Applied Materials (AMAT) within the
semiconductor sector. Applied Materials is the strongest stock in the
Semiconductor equipment world, and as such it has always produced steady and
predictable earnings.



Sector Analysis

Healthcare and Insurance related Stocks continue to attract  money

Once again we like to stay with stocks that are outperforming the broad
market. Past few months we have been pointing out health and food related
stocks that are among the defensive stocks that has caught the interest of
investors. We at RealTimeTraders.com believe the healthcare and insurance
related stocks will continue to move higher regardless of the possibility of
technology stocks coming back into the spotlight. Some of the stocks that are
worth mentioning are United Healthcare (UNH) has been hovering around its
52-week high for the past few weeks. Friday the stock closed at a new 52-week
on average volume. Allstate Corp. (ALL) closed at a new 52-week high on
Friday for the fourth consecutive day. Oxford Healthcare (OXHP) has set
series of new highs since we started to alert our readers to this stock back
in May 2000. We continue to see positive money flow into this stock.




Economic Reports & Bond Markets

This week markets will start out with a light schedule of economic reports.
However, as the week heads towards the end markets will face some important
economic reports that will help economist determine the direction and the
strength of the economy. Monday wholesale inventory for the month of October
is scheduled to be released at 10:00 AM. Analysts expect the inventory to
climb higher by 0.3-0.5%
