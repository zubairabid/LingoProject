Remember how much fun (and easy!) it was to ride a bike as a kid?  Have you
ever considered joining Team Enron to ride your bicycle from Houston to
Austin in support of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society?  If the answer
is "yes" to either of these questions, make plans to attend an informational
workshop hosted by the Enron Cycling Club from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM, Friday,
February 2nd, in EB5C2.  Take advantage of the opportunity to ask general and
detailed questions about training rides, cycling equipment, signing-up,
pledging and the entire experience.

Saying to yourself "I can't ride my bike five miles much less 150..." then
seriously reconsider!  You only need to ride 300 miles total before the MS150
to get used to being on your bike.  Can't ride during the week?  No problem!
This training goal can be accomplish by simply riding on Saturday mornings.
Come to the workshop and learn more!  Don't delay - start training now!!

Last year, Team Enron raised $537,000 and was the #1 fund-raiser in the
entire country - learn how to be part of this fabulous team and take
advantage of Enron's Matching Gifts Program!  For more information, contact
