I have a seat for Frank and I am working on Gil and the rest of those guys.
Ina is out until Thursday, but I will be giving her a call at home this
morning to see what can be done.  I will coordinate the move as  soon as I
have a space.  Meanwhile, I am checking with the guys periodically to meet
their needs while they are on the 31st floor.  Call me if you have any
further questions x35193.

Regards,

Kimberly
