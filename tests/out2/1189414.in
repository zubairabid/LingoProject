this is another publication we are seeking to put on EnronOnline.  This party
had their own contract, so please take a look and lets discuss.  The deal is
pretty simple:  We pay 25,000 for a one year deal.  No user counts, or fees,
or attrition.  Just 25K for unlimited use.  They publish monthly but have
committed to going to twice a month.

thanks
Dave
