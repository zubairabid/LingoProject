Whew!! Your schedule makes me tired!  I am sure that Brigeda is happy that
you are involved in so many activities with her school - and then on the
other hand, sometimes you wonder if they notice!  Work sounds crazy for you,
but how nice that you will be off from December 21 until the 2nd.
I hope that make it over the week before Christmas.  The week is kind of
crazy for us, so I am trying to find a time that will work.  Sunday the 17th
we are having a dessert party at our house, inviting neighbors, old Huntwick
friends, etc.  It is for families, and Meagan and Amanda each included 4 of
their friends in the invitiation list, along with their familities.  It will
be multi-generational - I hope fun, as it would be a nice tradition to
continue.  On Monday, I think that David plans to take Tyler and Amanda to
Longview for a visit.  A commitment that Meagan and I have to sort toys at
Northwest Assistance Ministries from 12:30 to 4:00 that day has excused us
from the trip.  So it may be best for Meagan and me to drive over to Austin
after 4:00 on Monday.  We could be back by the time David and company return
to Houston on Tuesday afternoon.  Wednesday we have matinee tickets to see A
Christmas Carol at the Alley  Theater, sans Tyler.  Thursday I am having all
of my girls in NCL over to wrap gifts for the family that we have adopted for
Christmas and then we will deliver the presents.  And Friday is Tyler's
birthday, with a 102 Dalmation theme planned (cake ordered from RJ Goodies,
but nothing else done yet!).  So I really think that our only shot to make it
to Austin is for Monday night, which would mean only Meagan and me.
I talked with Mom last night and invited Dad and her to Houston for
Christmas.  I don't really think that they will come, but if they do, I hope
that doesn't mess up your Christmas.  They have only been here for one or two
Christmases with us since we have had kids.  I think that Tyler at 3 this
year will be particularly enthralled.  And next year they will have 2
grandchildren in Austin, so it just seemed that this could be a good year for
them to come.  She said she would think about it, and I told her that I
wanted her to know that we would love to have them, but that it was perfectly
okay if they decided that they did not want to come.
How about Dad playing golf this week?  What a difference!! I am so glad that
he is doing better.
I hear you about Mom.  I think that a blow-up or some drama is highly
predictable, unfortunately.  She seems to do that a lot at special occassions
for Cara, doesn't she?  I will certainly help in any way I can.  And I will
be very interested in the gosipy details.
Happy baking!    I do have to make 5 batches of fudge tonight and tomorrow
night so that I can attend a cookie exchange luncheon on Saturday armed with
27 packages of fudge.
