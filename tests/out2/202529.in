Kristen,

I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have
Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was
pathetic....I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that
weekend?...well good...."  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the
phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me
details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had
time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them
(I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?

Mat
