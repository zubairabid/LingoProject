I scheduled this meeting in Houston to best accomodate schedules of some of
our Enron speakers -- the hill country or even Galveston was going to make it
impossible for Jeff Skilling to join us.  I would look at this meeting as if
it were to be held outside of town.  I have preliminarily reserved rooms for
all of you at the Wyndham Warwick.  Part of the reason for this forum is to
meet and get to know your counterparts in other Enron operating companies and
from around the world.  If you can stay at the hotel, this team building will
probably be enhanced.  This memo is not to force you to pack your bags and
stay at the hotel, but to let you know that my budget for the event did
include rooms for all of you for Sunday and Monday nights.  I hate the Sunday
thing, but in trying to minimize the time out of the office for those who
will travel from far away, this best suited their schedules.  Please let
Patti know on Thursday whether or not you would like a room at the hotel to
make it easier for you to fully participate.
