This may just be the eye of the storm, but the Fiesta Frenzy has settled down
to a less hectic pace. With all of the game tickets sold and (hopefully) all
of your travel plans made, there isn,t much left to do besides enjoy the
holidays.

If you still can,t think of anything other than the Fiesta Bowl, we do have a
couple of items for you to work into your schedule while you,re in Tempe.

One of the biggest events of the week is the Official OSU Pep Rally. This is
the largest OSU-only event planned in Arizona, and will feature comments by
Coach Erickson, Jonathon Smith and Ken Simonton, plus it,s FREE! The Pep
Rally will be held at 4 p.m. on Sunday, December 31, at the Wells Fargo Arena
on the Arizona State University campus. For more details, take a look at the
Pep Rally web page: http://alumni.orst.edu/pep_rally.html

After the rally is over, it,s just a short walk to the Tempe Tostitos Fiesta
Bowl Block Party, one of the biggest New Year,s Eve celebrations in the
nation. More than 100,000 people annually ring in the New Year at this
electrifying event that has been called one of the top places to spend New
Year's Eve by USA Today. Tickets are $15 and are available now through the
OSU Alumni Association. Call 541-737-2351.

On Friday, December 29, and Saturday, December 30, the OSU Alumni Association
has organized two Beaver Believer Socials in Tempe. On Friday night from 6 to
9 p.m. we,ll be at McDuffy,s Sports Bar, located in downtown Tempe at 230
West 5th Street, one block west of Mill Avenue. The event is open to anyone
21 and over, and if you show your OSU Alumni Association membership card, the
$5 cover charge will be waived.

On Saturday night, we,ll be at Club Rio, located at 430 N. Scottsdale Rd, one
block south of the 202 Loop in Tempe. Club Rio is an official Beaver "hub" in
the heart of downtown Tempe and will accommodate around 2,000 Beaver fans who
want to show their Beaver spirit. Join the band, cheerleaders and Benny
Beaver at this high-energy event! The $5 cover charge is waived to all fans
