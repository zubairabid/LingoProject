Thanks, Sandi.  This tracks very well with my chat with Barbara.  Barbara's
charcterization of "irrelevant" arguably makes sense from a customer's
perspective, but it's very relevant to us, though I didn't give Barbara the
details of why it's so important for us---just explained that some of our
customers, given their contracts with us, would get hurt.

Seems that the important take away is that 1) they are actively negotiating
the "end" of the rate freeze, 2) customers get hurt from a retroactive "end"
and 3) one "freeze" will the replaced with another, that is, prices will
continue to be capped going forward (despite the "end" of the rate freeze).

Seems that the critical issue is whether the rate freeze "ends" next month,
or next year, which is something that we're going to want to follow very
closely.  Do we have any information on where the negotiations between
customers and the utilities ended up this weekend?

Best,
Jeff
