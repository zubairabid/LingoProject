The email just sent mentioned that SDG&E stated that the ALJ Ruling was
inappropriately applied to SDG&E. The utility filed an Emergency Ex  Parte
Request to Commissioner Neeper requesting that theyshould be
excludedbecause:

"1)SDG&E is not in the same financial situation as SCE and  PG&E, nor has it
asked the Commission in this docket to make any findings  regarding its
financial situation; furthermore, SDG&E is not subject to the  same
regulatory environment as PG&E and SCE;
2)SDG&E has not  asked for the relief those utilities are requesting, nor
any affirmative relief  in this docket; and
3)The SCE and PG&E emergency petitions seek a  legal interpretation of
Public Utilities Code Sections 367(a) and 368(a).  Factual information from
SDG&E is simply irrelevant to the Commission,s  legal interpretation of
statute. Rehearing regarding the Commission,s  interpretation of those
statutes has already been denied. SDG&E did  not seek rehearing of the CPUC,
s legal conclusions, nor has it joined in  PG&E and SCE,s petitions now."

A thought occurs to me......is there anything to be gained with SDG&E  by
havingWPTF file in support of their ex parte request and agree that  SDG&E
should not be subject to the information request?
