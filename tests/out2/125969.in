Kim,
The response to III P. should be Not Applicable, unless you are having
someone obtain a Certificate of Good Standing from the State of California.
The response to III Q. should be that the Final Contract and Transaction
Agreement will be signed by a Vice President of Enron North America Corp. and
as agreed with the City's counsel, a Certificate of Incumbency shall be
provided to verify that the person signing is an officer of the Company.
The remainder of the document appears okay.  I was curious as to how you
were going to respond to their statement regarding their potential purchase
of interstate transportation assets and their request that we manage these
assets for them.  Repricing should work.
Call me if you have any further questions.
