Mary,
Thanks for your interest, I will add you.
The meeting arose out of a need to identify where clearing needs to be in the
future.  Legal will address
the legal implications of confirming web based deals.  It was rumored at one
time that the web based receipt  was sufficient for confirmation of the
deal.
This issue as well as many others will be discussed.
Clearing users from London, Calgary, and Houston will have a chance to
present their requirements. These requirements will  include
a need for web based clearing,  the nature of which  Commodity Logic is
developing.  We are currently working closely with the Commodity Logic
project  in
order to assure that the entire process of clearing deals as it exists today
can be made as efficient as possible.
Web based clearing will be one of many requirements we hope to flush out
during these meetings,  Based on the requirements we will
work with London to develop a plan that get us where we need to be.
Thanks for the invite, I will try and make it.
Ron
