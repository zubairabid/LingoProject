Keep in mind that if we wait to see if the well is a producer, we have
probably lost 2 weeks of the 4 week in-service that POGO has requested in
their first conversations.  Since we have a pre-payment, I agree that the
design and generation of a material list proceed.  Let me know if you hear
anything contrary to what the field rep. has conveyed to Laura K.  Please fax
the signed copy of the work order to Reggie, if you did not take care of it
last Friday.  Have a great week!
