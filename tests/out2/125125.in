Dan,

Attached below is another Netting Agreement that this counteparty would like
to have executed.  This is mainly an active Canadian counterparty (where we
have all contracts executed with ECC) but they also do business with ENA.
The exposures are getting significant enough where they are needing netting
arrangements.

Please take a look at this draft that they have forwarded below.  If you find
it unacceptable, let me know and I will communicate it to the counterparty
and forward ours.  They initiated this and preferred we view their "simple"
document.

Thanks,

Veronica
