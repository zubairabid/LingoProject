I don't understand the import of this ruling.
Judge is ruling that prudently incurred costs are recoverable therefore:
They cannot let the utility go bankrupt?????  They still can if the CPUC
rules that the value of their assets exceed the shortfall.
Can you tell me what the significance of this ruling is??
This suggests that the utilities were bluffing about declaring chapter 11.
Now they are protecting against it.?
