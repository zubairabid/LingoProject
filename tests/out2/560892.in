Thanks for your note Sally that is very helpful .
I think my main concern is to ensure that we have the most effective and
efficient communication between the Doorstep team and the business unit . I
would like John and I to be more involved in the process so that the team can
put the situation in context , so that they know our concerns in addition to
any they may have . It is also important to be clear as to what has already
been identified and is being addressed and how . While I understand that part
of the idea of doorstep is to " rattle the cages " of the commercial
management , it is important to check if my cage is already rattling as it
was in this case .
John and I would always expect to see and discuss a report before it is
discussed in Houston - unless there is a very good reason to do otherwise . I
take any issues of a control nature very seriously but my approach is to
insist on a verification of the facts before making any judgements which does
lead to some delay , on occasion , while facts are being gathered . What I
would also like , in addition to a briefing and discussion at the start of
the review , is a debrief from the team to get their impressions directly ,
both as to the issues and also as to how my control teams are doing . There
is always a question of prioritisation of resource , particularly in
businesses like metals which will be a constant challenge ( going forward you
will have similar issues on Steel etc ) and I would like the doorstep team to
provide me with their input on whether they agree with our approach and also
to discuss areas where I think an additional doorstep review may be helpful
.  I know you are working on the doorstep process with Mike Jordan , but I
would be grateful if you could ensure that the increased communication
happens in the future .
Thanks
Michael
