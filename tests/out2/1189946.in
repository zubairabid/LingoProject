This is certainly a tough one.  We go to great lengths to avoid regulation
here and have been fairly successful to date.  We do have some oversight from
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) regarding our power trading
and pipeline activities and local state regulators keep an eye on our purely
intrastate pipeline activities, but for the most part we are unsupervised.
If it helps, we conduct our derivative trading operations in accordance with
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulations (but that's just
complying with the Eligible Swap Participant and Trade Option Exemption
rules).  It is true we are a member of the NYMEX and subject to their rules
but they relate almost exclusively to trading on the NYMEX.  It might be more
helpful to talk to the guys in London about our SFA regulatory status.  We
have quite a bit more supervision there than we do here in the states.
