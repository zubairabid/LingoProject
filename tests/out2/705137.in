Bret: I discussed this with Bill Kendrick this afternoon, our suggestion is
that you forward my original message on the subject to Texaco's attorney
asking several questions: 1) is Texaco aware of the pipeline removal
activities; 2) has the release been stopped and how; 3) has the extent of
impacted soil been determined and does it extend onto NNG's property or down
to groundwater; and 4) has the NMOCD been notified. We should also indicate
our concern that other Texaco pipelines crossing near or through NNG's
facility may also be in poor condition and should be checked, particularly
the two lines which cross the southwestern corner of the NNG facility near
the location of monitor well MW-3 (NNG's well which contains PSH). This will
allow Texaco the opportunity to notify the OCD.
In a related matter, I think a copy of the letter that I prepared for Larry
regarding excavation activities should be transmitted to Texaco's attorney
and the OCD. I suggest sending a copy of this letter to the OCD because Bill
Olson with the OCD had asked for a copy of any correspondence that was
generated regarding the excavation activities and because Texaco has already
indicated that their lab results did not identify the presence of impacted
soil remaining in the excavation area.
