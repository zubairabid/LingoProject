I attended Cmmr. Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded
today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch
and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law
Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative
hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into
the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale
markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market
structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this
session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory
intervention in the market.
Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was
present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold
hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference
announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation
of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund
authority.
The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by
Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any
questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No
questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of
academics were comprised of:
1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley
2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard
3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee)
4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees
5.  Dr. Gene Coyle
6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne
The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any
institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be
to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too
high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of
blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The
concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the
mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of
Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a study using recent data as part of
his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was
some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I
think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified
concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas
costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage
utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of
real-time market power.
Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to
promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain
system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase
ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.
The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution
utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This
included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider
role.
Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible
without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be
support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a
good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand
response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to
the extent currently experienced in San Diego.
Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN
and ORA.
While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not
generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system,
today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame.
SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in
excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their
inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR
proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the
utility to be more responsible with their purchases.
UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate
caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I
customers are experience difficulties as well.
TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking
contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of
assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been
divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify
the Commission's authority to order retention of assets.
Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current
requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN
disagreed.
