Internet Tip of the Day
Wednesday November 29, 2000

The Wireless Future

The wireless Internet is the big buzz these days. It's here, but it's not
ready for prime time. Most wireless Internet services deliver an abbreviated
Web experience -- all text, for instance, or special low-graphics Web pages.
It's expensive, too. Most wireless Internet devices are Net-capaable cell
phones and PDAs, though more and more laptops and palmtops are offering
wireless modems. Wireless is still for road warriors and others who need it
at this point, but not for long. Telephone carriers, cell companies, and ISPs
are teaming up to make wireless Internet service cheaper and more common.
Some even foresee an entirely wireless future. You'll be able to surf the Net
wherever you are, and make phone calls, too. As bandwidth grows, you'll even
get television and other multimedia entertainment over wireless devices.
Displays will get larger and brighter, batteries more efficient, and wireless
pipes fatter (can you still call it a "pipe" when it comes through the air?).
It's all going to happen, and sooner than you think.
