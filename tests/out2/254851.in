Stan -

Yesterday, Jim Templeton and I met with Mike Stites (sp?) at Conoco.  He
had very interesting ideas about when standards should be introduced to a
market, and noted his view that the power market was not ready yet for
standards -- either retail or wholesale.  I also spoke this week to Bill
Benham, who supports a broader scope for GISB with the provisos that gas
issues not become minimized, and that segments retain balance.  It looks like
the producers could be split in a vote to broaden GISB's scope.

Veronica is working with your office to set up a conference call with
Alex DeBoissiere regarding the recent EEI Board meeting.  We should have some
material prepared prior to your meeting that might help.

NERC is working with us to gain electric utility participation in the DOE
and FERC industry meetings.  Hopefully, with their participation they may
support a combined gas & electric standards organization.

Best Regards,  Rae
