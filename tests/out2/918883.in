I wanted to provide an update on our progress with AEC.  Bryce Baxter and his
team members have been in contact with Mike Bennett and Bill Hogue to
understand their needs.  We have provided the initial information they
requested (i.e., one month of data), and are awaiting their approval before
completing the analysis on the remaining months.  I am confident that we have
established clear points of contact within Settlements for Mike and Bill and
we will continue to work on solidifying the relationship.
Please let me know if you have any questions.
