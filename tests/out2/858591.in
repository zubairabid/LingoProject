One of the most intriguing matchups to watch in this year's Culligan Holiday
Bowl at San Diego will take place on the sidelines with Texas coach Mack
Brown going up against Oregon's Mike Bellotti.

You may not know much about Bellotti, but know this about his tenure at
Oregon - in six years, he has a 48-22 record, and those 48 wins are more than
any other Pac-10 school during that time period. And over the last four
seasons, Oregon is 33-13 with four consecutive bowl game appearances. The
Ducks' two losses this season were by a combined total of 14 points (37-34
vs. Wisconsin and 23-13 at Oregon State).

Brown certainly is impressed by Bellotti's success at Oregon.

"Mike Bellotti is a personal friend," Brown said in a news release from UT's
sports information office. "He took over for Rich Brooks at Oregon a number
of years ago when they were representing the Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl for the
first time in a long time. He has done a great job building on that success
each of his years as head coach. It will be fun to be around him and his team
throughout the week."

Added Holiday Bowl president Jim Philion: "Coach Bellotti has built the
Ducks into one of the premiere football programs in the country. The game
this Dec. 29 against Texas will increase an already exciting rivalry between
the Pac-10 and the Big 12."

Longhorn fans can purchase tickets to the Culligan Holiday Bowl by

Longhorn Q & A  Q: Longhorn officials will probably not say which bowl they
would prefer to play in, but were any of their options less desirable because
of dates, travel, ticket sales or impressing recruits?
Todd Davis

BROWN:  The Longhorn team and coaching staff really wanted to go to the
Holiday Bowl. I know that sounds like, "Well, of course, that's what they
would say." But the coaches were trying to motivate the team before the
Kansas game by saying if UT won out, they would go to the Holiday Bowl, a
fun, sunny destination against a top 10 team. Aside from the beach balls and
surfing, the UT players wanted to go to San Diego because they are paid
mileage by the NCAA from their hometowns to get to the bowl game. For
instance, Chris Simms was paid $1,500 by the NCAA to get from New Jersey to
the Cotton Bowl last year. So he'll really clean up this year. Not that he
needs it. But you get the picture. It's a way for some of the players to make
a nice little chunk of change because what many of them will do is take the
mileage money from the NCAA and then try to buy a cheaper airline ticket and
pocket the rest. The players are responsible for getting to San Diego on
their own. The team will not charter a flight. (All players have to be
checked into the team hotel in San Diego by 10 p.m. on Dec. 22). Mack Brown
wanted to go to the Holiday Bowl from the time it appeared Oklahoma would win
the Big 12 South because he knew it would give Texas a chance to play a top
10 team. And he wants his team excited and pumped up to play a surging team.
Last year, Texas and its fans couldn't seem to get fired up for an unranked
7-4 Arkansas team in the Cotton Bowl, one year after having played in the
same game. So believe it when UT says the Holiday Bowl is where it wanted to
be.







[IMAGE] Casey Hampton

Q: How high do you think Casey Hampton will go in the NFL draft?  I would
think he's a cinch first rounder. Could he go in the top five?

BROWN:  Hampton could go in the first or second round. The second round
might be more likely because there are so many highly touted defensive
linemen coming out this year. But Hampton has been really watching his weight
and trying to improve his speed. He promised me that scouts at the NFL
combine will be surprised when

they see him work out. Hampton is a great story. The guy just works his tail
off and knows that his height (slightly more than 6-1) will probably play
against him. So he is going to try to blow scouts away in every other area.
But as he told me in a story that The Dallas Morning News and DallasNews.com
ran before the Texas Agame, "The film don't lie. If you can show me where my
height has hurt me, it's on you." I would be surprised if Hampton fell to the
third round.



Q: Let's see now: Rose Bowl ... Cotton Bowl ... Sugar Bowl ... Orange Bowl
...  Fiesta Bowl ... Galleryfurniture.com Bowl ...  Which one does NOT give
you cold chills just to think about?
R.R.

BROWN:  At least the galleryfurniture.com Bowl is not called the Poulan
Weedeater Bowl, a name that still haunts the now-Sanford Independence Bowl,
where Texas Awill meet up with former coach Jackie Sherrill this year. We
have to hope the furniture bowl, which will be played in the Houston
Astrodome, fairs better than the old Bluebonnet Bowl, which went bankrupt and
failed to pay Texas and Pittsburgh their purses for the 1987 game (won by UT,
32-27). That was the last bowl game ever played in Houston.



Q: Texas' quarterback controversy early this year was an artificial thing
manufactured by the ill-fated rotation scheme. Now, however, the  quarterback
controversy is real. Texas now has two genuine starting  quarterbacks. Chris
Simms is no longer the next boy wonder. He  has arrived. Does ANYONE in the
nation have a better quarterback  tandem than Texas? How in the world is Mack
Brown going to deal with this?  If they keep the simplified offensive scheme
next year, do you think the  QB rotation could resurface and actually work?
Rowell Rogers, Denton, Texas

BROWN:  I said before this season that Mack Brown would earn every penny of
his salary because of the quarterback situation. And he'll earn every penny
again next year. Unless unforseen circumstances, such as injuries, dictate
otherwise, I think it will be difficult for Chris Simms to redshirt next
year. And I think it will be difficult for the coaches not to start Simms
next year. He won the job because of an injury to Major Applewhite, just as
Major won the job because of an injury to Richard Walton. If Simms starts the
bowl game, and Texas plays well and wins, Simms will have done nothing to
lose the job and would probably go into the spring and fall as the starter.
If Texas flounders under Simms in the bowl game and Applewhite needs to come
in and relieve him, then we are back to square one, with both guys battling
it out in the spring and fall to see who is the starter. Texas coaches have
said they were more comfortable with Applewhite coming off the bench this
season because of his experience. So we'll see if their stance has changed.



Q: The 70-yard pump-and-go TD play from Chris Simms  to B.J. Johnson is both
a validation of Simms' abilities AND an indictment  of the quarterback
rotation. Chris Simms made that play happen because he had played  every
offensive down in the game to that point and knew the tendencies of the
defensive  player responsible. To my mind, that is a strong argument against
any kind of QB rotation  scheme. But, on the other hand, how can one NOT want
to play both of these  immensely talented quarterbacks as much as possible?
Can we get a rule change to allow  two footballs on the field at once (ha
ha)?

BROWN:  The only argument I could make in favor of the quarterback rotation
next year is that Simms should have more confidence and thus should flourish
whenever he is on the field. But his comments all season have directly and
indirectly indicated that he hated the rotation and that his confidence
didn't come around until he was taking all the snaps. So I don't know if the
coaches are willing to put him through that again and risk losing his
confidence.







[IMAGE] Mack Brown

Q: What is your opinion of Mack Brown as a gameday coach? I noticed earlier
in the season that you picked Texas Tech for the upset over the Longhorns,
which seemed to be an indictment on Mack Brown's ability to fire up the team,
assuming that Texas has more talented players. I think that he has proven
that he can win big games, but he has also had some surprising slipups. Brown
is unquestionably a great recruiter, but do you question his leadership
ability on gameday?
Andrew Wootton

BROWN:  Up until the Texas Tech game, Mack Brown was saying things like "We
could lose any game we play. I just don't know which team is going to show
up. We could go 6-5 or 9-2." Those kinds of

comments factored into my thinking when picking Texas Tech to beat the
Longhorns. Brown is as adept at public relations and communication as any
coach I've been around. So when he was saying things like that, it made you
wonder if this team was ever going to develop an identity. Clearly, this year
was a tough year in terms of leadership on the field on offense. The defense
was fine with Casey Hampton leading the charge. But the offense really
struggled to find an identity. Part of that was the quarterback rotation.
Part of it was having young receivers, and part of it was having a bunch of
guys with low-key personalities (i.e. Hodges Mitchell, Leonard Davis, Antwan
Kirk-Hughes, Derrick Dockery, Mike Williams etc.). Mack Brown even said it
was the quietest bunch of offensive players he'd been around. Once Mack Brown
and Co. decided to simplify the offense and designate Major Applewhite as the
starter, Brown was making a plea to the offense for leadership as much as
anything else.

I think Mack Brown is a great coach. Let me say that again. He is a great
coach. I think this year was a test of his finding and developing leadership
on the field. The more he rotated the QBs, the less chance the offense had to
develop an identity because the young receivers were clearly struggling with
learning their responsibilities in four-wide as well as trying to adjust to
having two QBs coming in and out of the huddle. The offensive linemen, early
on, also struggled with gap schemes and just hitting the guy in front of him.
I'm sure the coaches thought the offense would come together more quickly
than it did. Mack Brown has already gone back and said that he wished he
played Simms more in the Stanford game - an outing in which Applewhite really
struggled until the fourth quarter. Against Oklahoma, the Sooners executed
flawlessly early and Texas got hit with a punch it couldn't get up from. It
was the first inexcusable loss of the Mack Brown era and ended his honeymoon
in Austin, according to many.

But Mack Brown is smart enough and charming enough to have the fans eating
out of his hand any time he wants. All he has to do is tune out the negative
comments he hears reported in the media or on the Internet and simply say,
"We are doing the best we can. We learn. We make mistakes. We're going to
keep trying harder." Those are comments no negative fan can argue with.
Instead, Brown became upset with the negative voices and let it taint
everything about this season. Each press conference was filled with a comment
about how the media and fans had beat up this year's team. It was
contentious. Mack Brown uses Joe Paterno as his role model often times.
Paterno hates the media, rarely gives out interviews, etc. So if Mack Brown
is following in Paterno's footsteps on that issue, it would be a shame.
Paterno doesn't have one-quillionth the public relations savvy of Mack Brown.

Brown got tough questions during his radio call-in show this season. Some
weeks he hid his contempt for them better than others. But a guy like Brown
is good enough and smart enough that he should just let this stuff roll off
of his back, use that self-deprecating laugh of his and then take his
frustration out in the meeting and film rooms while finding ways to turn his
team into a juggernaut. Mack Brown should know his team's personality going
into next year because so many players will be back. And he'll have this year
as a blueprint of how not to do things, in many instances. And he's where he
wants to be - at a major college football power and always being in the
position of favorite. At North Carolina, as well as he recruited and coached,
Florida State was always going to be the bully in the neighborhood. At Texas,
he had beaten Nebraska the first two times he played them and showed that
Texas was going to be the new bully in the Big 12. Now, Oklahoma has come
charging past the Longhorns and Bob Stoops has done everything without
excuses. If you notice, Stoops didn't gripe about having to play the Big 12
title game and possibly ruin his team's national title chances. He didn't
gripe about the cold weather that everyone said would do in the Sooners in
Kansas City. He has a tough attitude, and his team has adopted his attitude.
Brown has a tough attitude, too. And against Oregon in the Holiday Bowl and
all of next season will be the truest test of Brown's coaching and dealing
with expectations. Brown said, fairly and accurately, that Texas couldn't be
expected to win the national title this year because the Longhorns hadn't
finished a season in the top 10 since 1983. "How do you jump to No. 1 without
having first been in the top 10?" Brown said before the season. Does this
kind of talk trickle into the ears of players? I don't know. Most of the
Longhorns before the season (Applewhite and Hampton included) felt like Texas
could win the national title. That's one of the biggest reasons Hampton came
back to Texas this season. When UT lost to Stanford, Brown emerged from an
emotionally blasted locker room and said, "I didn't think this was a national
title team." He went on to say the team was too young. Are these excuses for
his team? If Texas beats Oregon in the Holiday Bowl, the Longhorns will have
their top 10 finish and will once again be ranked in the top 10 heading into
next season.

On defense, the big question mark will be at defensive tackle because Casey
Hampton and Shaun Rogers will be moving on. But Marcus Tubbs, Adam Doiron and
Stevie Lee provide an ample foundation to rebuild at the position. Cory
Redding and Kalen Thornton should only get better, and there is a wealth of
talent in the seven guys behind them. On offense, the big question mark is at
running back, where Hodges Mitchell is moving on. He's a guy some Texas fans
still think is worthless. But let me tell you, he isn't. He's got guts and
gave everything he had. It may take some time to see another back who can
catch and run the way he does. UT will have several backs to pick from,
including freshman-to-be Cedric Benson. The rest of the team is proven and
will pick up Bo Scaife at tight end.

I don't see any excuses for this team next year. National championship talk
will be all over this team like sunshine in Bermuda. Here's hoping that Mack
Brown doesn't let the nitpickers bog him down. And I include myself in that
group of nitpickers because reporters are paid to point out all of the facts
- positive or negative. Here's to hoping Mack Brown will spend less time
getting reports fed to him about negative Internet postings and any possible
negative angles in a newspaper story. Here's to hoping that he'll take on
critical questions with the ease and charm he shows publicly on a daily
basis. Places like Texas, Alabama and Ohio State have fans who are seemingly
never satisfied. Until Brown wins a national championship, UT fans will
second-guess and doubt and wonder why something else wasn't tried. That could
continue even if he wins a national title. But that's sports. It's worse now
because there is more coverage of sports than ever before with the Internet
and all-day talk radio. Mack Brown lives under a microscope. Fans think they
are as smart as coaches because they manage a fantasy football team. Brown
just has to shrug off the naysayers and focus on the reasons he loves
coaching.



Q: Among UT's current commitments, who do you see as the freshmen most
likely to see  significant playing time next year?

BROWN:  The more I see and hear about Midland Lee running back Cedric
Benson, the more I think he has the best chance to have an impact next year.
He appears to have the kind of vision that makes running backs special.



Q: Only two teams had a strength of schedule rating above 3.0 in the BCS
rankings and all the top five teams had a sub 0.6 rating. Given that UT has a
decent chance in the national championship race next year, what - if anything
- can UT do to help raise its strength of schedule rating? Seems like the
Longhorns could go undefeated and still be on the outside looking in.
Andrew Bowen

BROWN:  Well, gauging by how some of the BCS polls had Florida State higher
than Oklahoma, I think it's fair to say that strength of schedule is a
concern for Texas next year. I think Texas has to win all its games next
season to make sure that it is not in the position of Miami, which beat
Florida State but is not in the national championship picture. If Texas goes
10-1 next season, the Longhorns could very well not be in control of their
own destiny. With their schedule, as crazy and inflated-expectation-riddled
as this sounds, the Longhorns would probably need to win all the games to
ensure getting a shot at the national championship next season.







[IMAGE] Leonard Davis

Q: Who will be drafted off this team? Any first rounders? Will the draft
distract the seniors from the bowl game? Will any juniors declare early? Is
the NFL looking at any underclassmen on the team?
Lance, Grand Prairie

BROWN:  The obvious draft picks are OT Leonard Davis, DT Casey Hampton and
DT Shaun Rogers. SS Greg Brown may also get a look from an NFL team after the
year he has had. I think Davis is a first-round pick for sure. Hampton and
Rogers shouldn't fall past the second round,

although they could simply because there are a number of top defensive
lineman in next year's NFL draft. NFL scouts are intrigued by junior Quentin
Jammer because of his size and physical play at cornerback. NFL scouts like
junior De'Andre Lewis' speed and size at linebacker. But UT officials seem
confident that no underclassmen will jump from this year's team.



Q: Please discuss the coaching staff's approach to bowl games. Did we
approach the Mississippi State Cotton Bowl with a different philosophy or
attitude than the Arkansas Cotton Bowl? What is our attitude about Oregon and
the Holiday Bowl?
Keith Heugatter

BROWN:  The Cotton Bowl after the 1998 season was the final chapter to a
storybook season. That team was riding the euphoria of Ricky Williams'
Heisman Trophy and felt like it was on top of the world. The team that faced
Arkansas in last January's Cotton Bowl had lost two straight and then found
itself back in Dallas, feeling a little unsure about itself against an
Arkansas team looking for its first bowl victory since 1985. This season,
Texas is riding a six-game winning streak, finally got the breakout game it
was looking for from Chris Simms and really wants to win its bowl game to
finish in the top 10 for the first time in 17 years. I would be surprised -
very surprised - if Texas comes out flat and doesn't make a good showing in
the Holiday Bowl. Even though they don't know much about Oregon, the
Longhorns know the Ducks are ranked higher than they are. That's all they
need to know. If the players can avoid the trouble they ran into before last
year's Cotton Bowl (suspensions to two team leaders, Aaron Humphrey and Kwame
Cavil, as well as J.J. Kelly and Jamal Joyner), I think Texas will be strong
and focused.


Q: Is Leonard Davis up for any major awards this season?
Clark Routier

BROWN:  Longhorn OT Leonard Davis is one of three finalists for the Outland
Trophy. The award will be presented live on Thursday night (8-10 p.m.
Central) on the ESPN College Football Awards Show at Disney World. Davis has
been tabbed a first-team All-American by The Football Writers Association,
Walter Camp Football Foundation and Sporting News.



Q: Can you give us an update on the men's basketball team?
Shirley Lively

BROWN:  The men's team is starting to come together and could get a huge
boost in the next couple of weeks if senior Darren Kelly can regain his
eligibility. The semester ends Dec. 19, but coach Rick Barnes isn't sure when
he'll find out if Kelly has made his grades and regained his academic
standing for next semester. One thing is for sure: Barnes believes the 5-1
Longhorns will only get better with Kelly in the lineup. He said Kelly
dominates in practice with his dribble penetration and quickness. He said
Kelly would help players like junior transfer Maurice Evans. Evans, by the
way, has continued to look more comfortable in the Longhorns' offense. He was
named the Phillips 66 Big 12 Conference Rookie of the Week, the league office
announced Tuesday. The junior transfer earned the award by averaging 22
points per game while hitting 17-of-28 (.607) field goals, including 7-of-13
three-pointers, during Texas' two victories over UT-San Antonio (70-51) and
Southwest Texas State (90-60) last week. The honor is chosen by a panel of
media observers who cover Big 12 men's basketball. Evans had a season-high 23
points on 8-of-14 shooting (4-of-9 threes) vs. UT-San Antonio, before posting
21 points on 9-of-14 shooting (3-of-6 threes) against Southwest Texas. The
lone Longhorn to reach double-figure scoring in each of UT's first six
contests, he leads the team in scoring (17.3 ppg) and ranks third in
rebounding (5.8 rpg) and blocks (five). Texas returns to action when it
travels to Tampa, Fla., to face South Florida on Saturday, Dec. 9. Tip-off is
scheduled for 6 p.m. (Central) at the Sun Dome. The game will be televised
nationally by ESPN2.



Q: Can you give us an update on the women's basketball team?
Dana Gooden

BROWN:  The UT women are 8-1 and off to their best start since the 1989-90
season. They moved into the top 25 (No. 25) this week and then backed it up
by traveling to Illinois and pounding the Fighting Illini, 70-54. The Illini
were ranked No. 24 last week. UT extends its win streak to six games, marking
the first time since 1996-97 that the Horns have had a six-game win streak.
The leaders of this year's team are JoRuth Woods of Cedar Hill, Tai Dillard
of San Antonio, freshman Stacy Stephens of Winnsboro, sophomore Lindsey Ryan
of Austin Westlake and Tracy Cook of Cedar Hill. UT is also getting help at
point guard from junior college transfer Kenya Larkin of Duncanville.
Freshman forward Annissa Hastings will also be one to watch. UT plays Oregon
at home on Saturday and then won't have another test until Tennessee comes to
town on Dec. 22.
