Per my earlier e:mail message, I am forwarding to you the draft of the report
on the operations/controls review of Singapore.  (It is an attachment to the
message from Scott Earnest to me.)  The most current drafts of the reports on
Oslo and  Frankfurt were compiled by the AA team in London.  Nick Swingler is
apparently out on vacation this week.  I have asked AA personnel from Houston
to coordinate with their London office to get you a copy of those two draft
reports.  Given the time difference, you should receive thos reports via
e:mail from AA on Wednesday.  --Sally
