Marlene,  I am not sure what you are asking me to do.  If these contracts are
active then they should be put into whatever is the proper contract tracking
system for these types of services contracts (transport, pooling, etc.).  If
they are not active and are of no value, then they probably should not be put
into the database.  However, this is not a legal question, but a business
question.  If the business decision is made that they are of no value and
inactive, then they should be terminated in accordance with their terms.
Let me know if I am missing the point of your question.  If I am not, then I
will return these contracts to you.
