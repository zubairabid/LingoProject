Attached is the September 2000 Assignment, Termination & Expiration Report
for the Assets Group's contracts.  (FYI - It contains all of the entries made
by our group during 8/00 regardless of the effective date.)  If you do not
need to receive this report or if you know of someone else that should
receive it, please let me know by e-mail or phone (x-36982) so that I can
either remove your name from or add their name to the distribution list.
