Sally, Bob

FYI - Nice note from the Chicago office regarding the roll-out and training
in Unify. As you might know they are live on September 1 with Unify.
Currently they are only pathing on NGPL but we expect them to expand to
include both Trunkline and Northern Border. They have elected not to EDI
until  they get more comfortable with the system (maybe for October
business).

We will continue to develop their staff on the use of Unify through
additional training as noted below - Bob
