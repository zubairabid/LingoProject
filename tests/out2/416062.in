Well, actually Tanya, your statement below isn't a truly correct statement.
We have not consented to the Statoil/J. Aron assignment (in principal yet, in
actuality, no).  We are off about 19 trades and have sent the Statoil people
a list of the disputed trades to resolve.  Once we are in agreement about the
trades, I will add a paragraph to their form of assignment to the effect that
the assigned trades (be they physical or financial) will go under the
respective J. Aron master we have in place for that product.  Only then can
we move the trades...
