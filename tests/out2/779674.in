Matt,
Good report.  I am concerned about this expert's conclusions, the most
troubling of which is that our putting the ship on notice of the end use of
the cargo would have been of so little importance.  That is probably our
strongest point.  I also share your concern about his lack of experience as a
witness in an arbitration.  We need an expert who is well respected by U.K.
arbitrators and their tribunals.  I will likewise try to get other names.
Meanwhile, I question whether we should ask Capt Sawant to put anything in
writing concerning how to beef up his second report until we talk further.  I
am concerned that anything he puts in writing may be discoverable in a U.K.
arbitration proceeding if we use him as an expert and/or if he has any
otherwise discoverable factual information.  Would you mind passing this
concern by WFW for its comment?  I am assuming that the WFW counsel with whom
you are speaking are experienced maritime arbitration counsel.
Thank you for keeping us advised.  Deborah, please print this out (including
the attachment) for the file.
