Thanks for your note.  With the increased focus on our middle office products
and the possible outsourcing of those, I am in very stong agreement that all
groups need to start documenting their processes and procedures and believe
it falls under my responsibility to ensure they do so.

I would be very interested in knowing a bit more about SCOR as any tools - I
just received the package you sent me. I'll look it over and get back to you
on how I intend to approach this.

Thanks
