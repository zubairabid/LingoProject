Breeders' Cup Success




This  year's Breeders' Cup was a vintage affair and the busiest yet at
Sportingbet USA! We had all of our phone clerks busy as bees trying  to take
all of the action spawned by the pony runs. All of our phone  lines were tied
up as horse enthusiasts were frantically calling in  to place bets on their
favorite picks before the next race was about  to begin. There were a lot of
unexpected surprises as long shots,  such as Spain which paid 50-to-1,
eclipsed the favorites. The  succession of thrilling finishes had many of our
members on the edge  of their seats, not to mention our clerks on their
toes.  Congratulations to all of the big winners who were lucky -shrewd-
enough to reach the winners' circle.

Promotions



STUFF THE TURKEY!!

SportingbetUSA gives you yet  another reason to give thanks this year.
[IMAGE]Everyone  knows that underdogs (or "Turkeys" as I like to call them)
have the  highest paying odds, but 'favorites' are safe bets. So, to
accommodate our members' needs, we present to you the " Stuff the  Turkey "
NFL & NBA promo. From now until Thanksgiving Day each  time you place a wager
on a 'favorite' in either NFL or NBA, you get  a free entry into our
Thanksgiving Day drawing in which you could  instantly win a very special
prize! What is it? It's what everybody  wants. It's a brand new Palm Vllx
handheld! So, stuff those turkeys  and the more wagers you place on
'favorites' the better your chances  are to win.

NEW MEMBER?

For a short while new  members can get 10% on all initial deposits of $300 or
more.  Unlike other sports books, you choose the bonus! Opt for either 10%
in the form of betfrequent points (which can be later redeemed for  great
prizes), a corresponding parlay, CASINO chips, or a cash  account deposit of
up to $150. How's that for a bonus?

Tell-A-Friend Reward

Our Tell-A-Friend  Program gives you a chance to win cash by referring family
and  friends to SportingbetUSA. When they open an account and make a
deposit, you get $50 deposited into your account and are also  automatically
entered into both a weekly and a monthly  drawing for cash!

Loyalty  Program

SportingbetUSA is proud to have you as our  customer, and we'd like to thank
you for choosing our services! Each  time you place a wager our loyalty
program rewards you with  Betfrequent points. These points will accumulate in
your account  until you decide to redeem them for one or more of our fabulous
prizes.

*Please refer to our website for complete  details.
