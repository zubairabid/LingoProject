Client Companies
Visual Bridge - The company is negotiating content/streaming transactions
with two Latin American clients.  Expect to close one or both transactions by
year end.  Initiated discussions with EBS to review technology for EBS
clients.
Cynet - Expect to close sale of fax broadcast business by December 15, but
will have to finance $3.5 mm of $7.0 mm purchase price.  We are evaluating
alternative structures to address collateral issues and pay down a portion of
our existing preferred position.
Illusions Screen Printing - Moore Business Systems (an Enron Vendor) is very
late on a significant receivable for the company.  We are working with Enron
personel to address the issue.
American Communication Services - Increasing SWB agency business and
developing prime contractor relationship with SWB.
Treasury Connect - The company is having limited success in fund raising.
Currently the company is negotiating with TH Lee, Softbank and Reuters for
investments.  Paribas has committed to a private label portal transaction and
Deutsche Bank is reviewing a proposal.  With no new revenues, the company
will run out of cash at the end of January.  If currently anticipated
consulting and private label transactions are completed, the company should
be able to operate through March without additional financing.
Cabo's - Indicated that their liquor license had not been issued yet because
of delays caused by a background review of one of the limited partners.
Expect to have this addressed shortly.

New Transactions
Urban Financial - Expect closing December 15.  Our client negotiated a
significant reduction in the purchase price, in large part, because of an
equity funding shortfall.  Capital ratios for the bank will remain strong and
the new bank has already received indications of commitments from State of
Connecticut agencies.
Custom Feeds - Omni Bank is preparing their documents.  All other documents
have been drafted and are being reviewed.
Wilson Financial - Received financing term sheet from Chase Bank.

If you have any questions, please call.
