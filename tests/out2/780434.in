Richard --
PG&E and SCE (along with TURN) filed at FERC seeking refunds.  As Seabron
highlights below, I wouldn't put it pass them if they already have an idea of
who to "charge" for this summer.
Last I remember, we were not too concerned about the utilities filing in
state court seeking redress.  Given that the undercollection number is
approaching $4 billion, I just want to make sure that we have thought about
this angle.  The utilities are going to start trying to fix their problem in
every way possible (I sure as hell would if I were them).
