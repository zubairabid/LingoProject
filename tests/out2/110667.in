Summary of Energy Technology Bulletin:

* Siemens Westinghouse and four European utilities have formed a
consortium to build a 1 MW hybrid power generation plant that will combine a
Siemens solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) and a microturbine, which will be
supplied by the consortium utilities.  The unit will be tested as a
pre-commercial system for the European market and is expected to be in
operation by October 2003 at an Energie Baden-Wurttenberg AG (EnBW) facility
in Marbach, Germany.
* Two European utilities have awarded Siemens Westinghouse contracts
for their tubular solid oxide fuel cell system.  The two pre-commercial
units, one of which will be delivered to RWE Power AG in Essen (February
2002) and the other to Edison Spa in Milan (September 2002), will be 300kW
hybrid systems incorporating a microturbine and operating on natural gas.
* Real estate companies Arden Realty, CALPERS and RREEF dedicated two
large commercial solar power systems yesterday in Los Angeles.  The first
installation features nearly an acre of photovoltaic panels located on the
roof of a three-story office building owned by Arden Realty while the second
is located on an industrial building in Carlsbad, CA that is jointly owned
by CALPERS and RREEF (joint venture company is named CalWest Industrial
Properties).  Real Energy Corporation will sell the power generated by these
systems to the respective building owners.  Edison Development Corp., a
subsidiary of DTE Energy, supplied the solar panels that were built and
installed by PowerLight Corporation.
