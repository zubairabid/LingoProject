Kevin, I am not sure that you will get credit from the buyer for the
increased MW's given well known industry issues with the 501F technology.
Further, any buyer will pay based upon 90 degree output which is the same in
any case (ie) increased output only helps when ambient temperatures are lower
than 90 degrees at site.  Likely the buyer will run any spread option value
or multiple value based on 90 degree output.

I may be wrong but it is also my recollection that this is a warranty issue
rather than a true output issue (ie) we could increase the MW's at any time
but we would likely run into warranty issues with Westinghouse.  Given that
the warranty expires in less than twelve months, what value do we really
get.  Would it not be better to get the maximum amount of hard dollars out of
Westinghouse rather than an increase in output which will only be guaranteed
for a limited amount of time and likely will not be paid for by a buyer.

The thought process on the EECC side is for them to find overhead and cost
savings to fund their fee ($9.0M) rather than further increase to the capital
cost of the facilities.  As well, given current accounting language, any fee
we pay will have to be expensed to current earnings rather than capitalized
so I would like to find ways for this to be self financing.

My knowledge on this one is rather cursory - can you guys work this out and
adjust tactics with EECC as necessary.
