Yes, we have not been able to pull Laine and Jose away from their very
important activities on the Ridges, the Siemens negotiation and the Furnas/
Brazil Inc. efforts.  I think Eddie Daniels is going to try and start pulling
the scedule together this week and next.  Thanks for the follow up.  Please
let me know if the passage of time is endangering this effort.
