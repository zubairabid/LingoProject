Let's ask Jeff Hines(?), our opinion research guy, to put a few short
questions together and send it out.  We may also want to include a link so
people can view the commercials again before answering.
Also,  I was talking with Beth Tilney today about our website (and the fact
that every business unit now feels free to go do their own thing).  We
thought it would be a good idea to add this topic to the brand conference
(perhaps as part of an existing segment).
