Wayne,

Here is a brief  privileged and confidential (not to be handed to the other
side) description of the above-referenced matter from our attorney, Andrew
Bicknell of Clyde & Co. in London.  Andrew is available for further
consultation with you on Wednesday if you so desire.  His direct telephone #
is 9-011-44-207-648-1833 (that's calling from the US, of course).  Andrew's
e-mail address is "andrew.bicknell@clyde.co.uk"

I appreciate any help you can give us at your negotiations on Wednesday with
Exmar.  The best of all possible worlds is if both EGLI and Exmar could agree
to withdraw/dismiss their claims against each other and walk away from this
case before year end.  If you wouldn't mind, I would appreciate a short
e-mail from you regarding Exmar's response during your meeting with them.

Many thanks for your help.

Britt
