I love it!!  I think that is perfect.  Much easier for my family and
probably for everyone else.  That way we can probably do this on their
anniversary, assuming that works for everyone.  Removing some of the
travel
hassels should mean that everyone would have a better time, too.  Hyatt
Hill Country is one obvious choice - I was there in November and it is
still very nice.  There is a newer resort in the area also.  I can't think
of the name of it offhand, but David knows and I will get the name from
him
tonight and call you.  --Sally
