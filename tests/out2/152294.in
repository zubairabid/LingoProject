Bo thanks for the info.  I will review later.  At first glance it looks like
they didn't take too much out.  Please note their Exhibit A is wrong.  Either
ENA or Enron Compression Services is the Company (or Customer whichever case)
and EES should be one or the other.
Maybe we can get together tomorrow or Thursday, whichever fits your schedule.
