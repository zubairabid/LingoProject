Jess, there is little more than I indicated in my note.
I received a phone call from Sarita Sarvate, an analyst at the Energy
Division of the CPUC asking why we were returning gas customers to utility
service, citing "a number of customer complaints, including a school and a
hospital".  It now turns out that the school and the hospital are from the
same customer essentially.  The CPUC staff recognizes that they have no
direct jurisdiction over gas sales, but are concerned about the effect of
turnbacks on their utility regulation, as they are in the process of
eliminating the core subscription program which allows noncore customers to
take core service.  In fact there is now a resolution in place barring
noncore customers from taking core subscrition service from SoCalGas or
SDG&E.  They want to know if this is part of a trend which they will have to
adapt to or whether it is an isolated incident.  In addition, they would
like to be able to offer the customer some options for continuing gas
service.
Let me know if I can add any more or if you can assist us in responding to
the CPUC.
Thanks, Mike Day
