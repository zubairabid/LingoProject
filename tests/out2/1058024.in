Greg --

We have received a request to participate in Energy News Live, which is an
energy news web site created by Williams, but acting independently of them.
They are seeking the opportunity to interview traders from various companies
live from their company's trading floor and they would like Enron to
participate.  The discussion would be determined ahead of time and would not
be proprietary, but rather market oriented.  They deliver the news every hour
on the hour.

Mark Frevert suggested that I visit with you regarding our interest and/or
set up a meeting between you and whoever you deem appropriate with the Energy
News Live folks to discuss.  Please advise.

Eric
