Lisa,

I have a call into the physical steel lawyer.  We will not be able to copy an
existing profile for physical steel.  Physical steel is a totally new online
product for us.  We, obviously, cannot copy financial steel, because
counterparties may be prohibited from trading it if they are not ESP's, if
their master doesn't let them trade steel, etc (the usual swap issues).  What
I think my answer is going to be is that there is no legal reason why any
counterparty cannot trade physical steel, so I would open all counterparties
up to trade it.  I'm checking with the physical steel lawyers to confirm this.

Just a note, Global Contracts should also not be able to copy a profile,
because they should have a totally new GTC dealing with physical steel issues
specifically.  I'm sure Karen will probably copy me in on her email.  Just in
case...I want to confirm what Global Contracts is saying for this one...

I'll get back to you to confirm the above for Legal.
