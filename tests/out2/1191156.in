Hey Mark, great to hear from you.  I actually went to Argentina and Chile
about 5 years ago for 2 weeks and had a blast.  I'd love to go back for a
longer period.  I was recommending it to Linda for a new place to go.
It sounds like things are going well for you in Houston.  I wish I knew you
were down there.  I was down for a weekend in July.  My college roommate and
his wife and their kids live there.  He's a 6th? 7th? year in Skadden's
Houston office.  Charles Still.  Ever work with him?  I'll let you know when
I'm back down there.
Have you been back to the Caribbean lately?  I was back in April for a week
in the BVI.  I really missed the place.  Do you ever get to Chicago?  Let me
know if you're going to be around.  Take care.
