Hi Sylvia,

Re the GISB for Wisconsin,  no we would not agree to the terms of their GISB
on the front page or their special provisions.   Are you aware we currently
have a GISB in place with Wisconsin Public Service Company and ENA as well as
with Wisconsin Gas Company??????

Re Master Status:  I have devoted  my afternoon to this contract  in order to
complete the redline.  Will keep you apprised.

Do you still want a copy of our GISB.  If so, I will send you a draft
however,  I need to fill in the name  of the counterparty etc. before it goes
out.
