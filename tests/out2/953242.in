Dear Dr. Kaminski,

This is a message of discussing the problem in Lacima's paper. I think that
Glen Dixon has told you there is a fault in the paper written by Dr. Clewlow
and Dr. Strickland. It is understandable to have some errors in their work.
People always make mistakes.

Actually, I found the problem in appendix A of their paper. They can't prove
the eq. A4 rigorously. There is something wrong in mathematical
interpretation. If you like, I can give you a full analysis of this problem.

PS: attached with their paper.

best regard
Quentin
