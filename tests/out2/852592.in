David, I'm not sure there is any value to this for EES North America. There
are well known and documented controls and process issues in the mid, back
and risk offices of the company.  We are working quickly to rectify  -
servicing your needs at the same time would slow us down.  On the European
side, I would like your perspective on their controls and business.
