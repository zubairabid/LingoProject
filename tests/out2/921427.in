Sally-
I will gladly include you on the distribution of the weekly status on the MG
acquisition and integration and instruct Esther Gerratt to add your name to
the list.
I concur that Brent's return to Houston will create a potential information
gap that even the best of weekly reports won't fill.  I think we may have an
opportunity to keep your information level high and address my need to assess
MG's remote offices.  If Brent were to linger in London for a few more
months, we could lay out a program to assess MG's 24 offices around the world
and benchmark their compliance with risk policies + procedures.  Brent's
background and recent experience with Doorstep give him strong credentials
for doing the job.  I haven't discussed this with MG's management, but it
seems to be the right kind of activity for a new owner to undertake.  What
are your thoughts?
