OSU ANNOUNCES BOWL GAME TICKET POLICY
Oregon State University is announcing today its policies regarding tickets
for the bowl season.  The policies relate to the two most likely bowls that
the Beavers could attend, the Fiesta Bowl in Tempe, Arizona, January 1st, and
the Holiday Bowl, in San Diego, California, December 29th.

&Because of the uncertainty of the Bowl Championship Series we will probably
not know our destination until Sunday, December 3rd after all the conference
championship games have concluded,8 said Mitch Barnhart, Director of
Athletics at Oregon State.

Beaver Athletic Scholarship Fund donors and Season Ticket holders will be
receiving a mailing this week with the policies and an application form for
tickets.  An application form for the general public will be available on our
website, www.osubeavers.com, once a decision on a bowl site has been
finalized.

The Oregon State Alumni Association is sponsoring an official tour, which
will include a game ticket and other amenities.  For more information please
contact them at their Bowl hotline number 1-877-305-3759, or at their
website, http://bowlgame.orst.edu/.
