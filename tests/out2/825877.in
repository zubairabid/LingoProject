I'm sorry, did we discuss BMC???.

Lee can confirm the accuracy of this, but BMC bought 20,000 from us and
intended no swing and no buyback. Brandywine (Dorcheus) controlled the meter,
therefore it is their responsibility to make up the overs and unders. I
believe a deal is in place with Brandywine to cover that very issue for
November. If not please let me know.

Lee, if this is not your understanding for Nov. business please let us all
know.

Thanks
Ken
