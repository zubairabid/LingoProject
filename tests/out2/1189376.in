Mario,
Yes, we should be ready to go, although the law firm we are using in Japan
(Baker & McKenzie in Tokyo) have indicated that they still have a few open
issues to follow-up on.
Baker & McKenzie have concluded that where an Enron non-Tokyo trading office
receives a payment on a swap from a Japanese counterparty, that payment
should not be subject to Japanese income tax or withholding tax.  Further,
they have advised that consumption tax (Japan's 5% VAT) should not apply to
financial transactions, although Japanese counterparties acquiring physical
product for delivery in Japan would be subject to the 5% consumption tax.
Baker & McKenzie have advised that they need to do some follow-up work with
respect to payments from options and from physical contracts as well as some
further checking on the tax treaties that Japan has with the countries where
our non-Japan trading offices are located.  I expect to have their response
shortly.
One issue that we are currently pursuing is the Japanese tax consequences of
the Enron Japan trading office providing services that benefit the other
Enron trading offices.  In this case, it may be appropriate for Enron Japan
to receive a service fee for such services.  I am in the process of
determining to what extent Enron Japan would be providing services.
Please let me know if you have any questions or need any additional
information.  I will let you know of any additional developments as soon as
they occur.
