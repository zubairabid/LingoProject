Sheesh. Sorry Folks. It's week 13  now. Fred Taylor still had me rattled
there...

Joe



Let's jump right into our Upgraded and  Downgraded Players. As we head down
the home stretch, identifying  those players moving up or down can be the
difference between making the  playoffs or watching from the sidelines.  As
we head into our 13th week of listing these players, it,s  inevitable that
some players will have made both the upgrade or downgrade  list. Make sure
you understand,  what we,re talking about is players that are moving. In
other words, a player like TE Chad  Lewis could appear on the downgrade list
and still be good enough to be a  starter in your league. It just  means I,m
concerned about the way he seems to be heading. Likewise, a player like WR
Willie  Jackson may make the upgrade list even though he,s still fairly far
down the  list of WRs. It,s all about which  direction players are moving.
Keeping an eye on these trends can very often make all the  difference.

Upgrades and  Downgrades. Some of these  players are obvious moves up or
down and some aren't as clear. Here's my  list of guys I see moving this
week.



QBs Moving Up

QB Gus Frerotte (Den) You have  to love Frerotte stepping in and performing
like he did. Of course, when  you throw the ball 58 times, good things often
happen. When you throw the  ball 58 times with a 62% completion percentage,
great things happen. Look  for more of the same.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG) The  Giants may be struggling but Collins continues
to put up excellent Fantasy  Football numbers. With guys like Kurt Warner
and Daunte Culpepper, it's  easy to get into the mindset that great FF QBs
come from great teams. Not  always the case as Collins is showing. Often
times, it's teams with  vulnerable defenses like New York or San Francisco
that provides the QB  motivation to play catch-up. Collins looks comfortable
in the pocket and  if he ever goes a game with both Amani Toomer and Ike
Hilliard healthy for four  quarters, who knows what might happen.

QB Brett Favre (GB) He's  baaaaack. I said last week that Favre coming back
on the bad foot would be  storybook material for a storybook kind of guy and
Favre delivered. 2 TDs  and 301 yards have the Packers riding high and
believing they canmake some  noise. WR Bill Schroeder is becoming an
excellent #2 WR and RB Ahman Green  is filling the void left by Dorsey
Levens.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) I may be  in the minority (imagine that...) but I was
very impressed with Brooks taking  over for Jeff Blake. He was not a #2 QB
like Jim Miller in Chicago that  knew he'd be inserted any minute. Brooks
was thrust into the game and  responded very nicely. He's skinny at #205 but
tall (6' 4") Big  league arm and nice mobility. Of particular note was his
tendency to throw  to WR Willie Jackson. We'll see if that continues. Sure,
he's a long  shot but if you're desperate for a QB, he could be a nice
surprise.

QB Ryan Leaf (SD) Hold the  presses, Ryan Leaf makes a Joe Bryant Upgrade
list. Seriously, he's an  easy target and I'll admit to taking my share of
shots but you can't deny the  guy has skills. Yes, there were some fluky
plays with Crockett injuring  himself on the long TD but I liked what I saw.
(although the 3 TDs on 13  completions did make for a wild looking box score
for Leaf) He's got some  weapons in Jeff Graham, Curtis Conway and his best
receiver, TE Freddie  Jones. He's as flaky as they come but he might be
worth a look if you're  dying at QB.



RBs Moving Up

RB Fred Taylor (Jac) Taylor  put together one of the best performances of
the year Sunday night. The  fact that he did it against the very tough rush
defense of the Steelers makes it  even all the more impressive. This isn't
like rolling up 200 yards on the  Cowboys or Cardinals. Clearly, there's
reason for huge hope as if he can  do this against Pittsburgh, he can do it
against anyone.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) Once  again, Lewis ran hard. He's got to be considered
one of the better RBs in  the game right now. I still worry about how
durable he'll be but he's  looked great lately averaging 6.7 yards per carry
Sunday for 187 yards. If  it weren't for that pesky Priest Holmes vulturing
a TD here and there, he'd be  even higher.

RB Darnell Autry (Phi) Autry  refuses to hand over the #1 RB job to Stanley
Pritchett or anyone else.  He's not very flashy but he gets the job done
both rushing and receiving.  The Eagles are suddenly looking very good in
the standings and Autry figures to  be a large part of that success.

RB Ahman Green (GB) I'd be a  little worried right now if I were Dorsey
Levens. Green averaged 6.4 yards  per carry Sunday as he rolled up 180 total
yards. Most importantly, was  his number of fumbles: Zero. No one's ever
doubted his incredible physical  skills, but now he seems to be bringing the
mental game to go with  it.

RB Mike Anderson (Den) I hate  to say it but Terrell Davis is doing a great
impression of Isaac Bruce's  maddening 1998 on again, off again season. As
you know, Davis missed  another game and once again, Anderson stepped in
nicely. By now, you  know it's tough to predict what Davis is going to do
each week so it looks to me  as if Anderson could be a very nice pickup.

RB Jamal Anderson (Atl)  Anderson's 4.5 yards per carry reminded many of his
1998 season. He's  running with power and speed and finally appears to be
over the knee  injury. I think he's been over it physically for a while now
but it seems  he's handling the mental aspect too.



WRs Moving Up

WR Willie Jackson (NO) New QB  Aaron Brooks did a nice job after being
thrust onto the scene and Willie Jackson  responded well with 4 catches and
85 yards including 2 TDs. Often times,  you'll see a backup QB favor the
backup WRs as they're familiar with them.  We'll see if this continues. I'm
guessing Brooks will get comfortable  throwing to Joe Horn this week but
Jackson is still definitely worth a  shot.

WR Joe Jurevicius (NYG) As I  mentioned above, QB Kerry Collins is playing
very well. With Ike Hilliard set to  miss some time, Jurevicius should get a
chance to show what he can do.  He's long been a Fantasy Football tease
showing flashes but never really having  the opportunity for playing time.
Let's see what he can  do.

WR Terry Glenn (NE) I've  beenhigh on Glenn since June. He made me look
good early on but had  cooled midseason. He's now back warming up again and
for you Glenn owners,  your patience is paying off. QB Drew Bledsoe didn't
have a TD, but he did  roll up the yards. Once again, Glenn was the prime
target.

WR Jimmy Smith (Jac) Smith  looks to be back along with RB Fred Taylor as
the Jags awakened their  offenseSunday night. Smith seems back in synch
with QB Mark Brunell  and the threat of Taylor helps open the passing game.
There may not be  enough balls to go around but you can bet there are enough
for  Smith.

WR James McNight (Dal) Yes,  he's a long shot considering the horrid play of
Troy Aikman Sunday but you have  to like a WR who's getting a ton of looks.
And McNight's getting those  looks from Aikman. Can't make plays without the
ball...



TEs Moving Up

TE Jay Reimersma (Buf) We've  been waiting for Reimersma to return to form
and he looks to be on his  way. He was heavily involved and seemed
comfortable with "new" QB Rob  Johnson. He can be a vital part of the
offense and you have to think  Johnson will continue to utilize him.

TE Kris Mangum (Car) Mangum's  no Wesley Walls yet but he does make for a
nice target. 4 catches for 47  yards is an improvement from what they've had
at TE and it looks like he's back  and healthy now.



Players Moving  Down



QBs Moving Down

QB Steve Beuerlein (Car)  There's only so much a QB can do by himself. He
lost Wesley Walls a couple  of weeks ago. I thought Beuerlein could handle
losing Tshimanga Biakabutuka but  losing WR Donald Hayes with a groin injury
proved too much. His OL is less  than stellar and he's just not having much
time to throw.

QB Shaun King (TB) King swings  back toward the side of mediocrity after a
91 yard passing effort against  Chicago. It looked that bad too. Even for a
Les Steckel  Offense. Losing Mike Alstott for several weeks will not be a
positive as  teams now can key on Warrick Dunn and Keyshawn Johnson.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) Not all  the turnovers Sunday were McNair's fault but
he certainly had a hand in  them. His problem remains a lack of healthy WRs
and a stellar RB in Eddie  George who can carry the load. Last year, it was
McNair vulturing TDs from  George but it doesn't seem to be a problem this
year.

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) If  you're a regular reader, you know I'm not a
Plummer fan. I'm especially  not a fan now that he's hurt as well. He may
get back soon but it won't  matter for this team that's in shambles
offensively.



RBs Moving Down

RB Thomas Jones (Ari) Jones'  was recovering from pneumonia Sunday but
still, you like to see a better yards  per carry average than negative 2...

RB Kevin Faulk (NE) Either  Bill Belichick is psychotic or Kevin Faulk is
not a very good football  player. How else do you explain Faulk earning one
carry while his RB  partner J.R. Redmond was inactive? Patrick Pass got the
bulk of the work  but was ineffective. I'm guessing, it's the fumbling that
earned his spot  in the doghouse.

RB Ron Dayne (NYG) As we've  said so often in the past, Ron Dayne's
productivity is tied directly to how well  the Giants are playing. If New
York is leading, you'll see Dayne. If  they're trailing, it's the Tiki
Barber show. Lately, it's been more Tiki  than Dayne. And if the Giants
don't make some improvements on defense, I  don't see that changing.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle)  Prentice got folks excited early in the year but
he's been disappointing of  late. Prentice is losing carries to Jamel White
and that doesn't look to  change anytime soon.



WRs Moving Down

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi)  Robinson is still the best WR on the team but it
appears the QB rotation is  affecting his play. With Shane Matthews
starting, Robinson had 5  receptions for 53 yards. While those numbers are
certainly not horrible,  they're not quite what we expect from Marcus. He
could improve with  another week of practice but I'm a little concerned right
now.

WR Joe Horn (NO) As I  mentioned above, I like Aaron Brooks a good bit but
there is no way that he's  anything but a significant downgrade from Jeff
Blake. Of special worry was  the fact Brooks seemed more comfortable
throwing the ball to Willie  Jackson.

WR Donald Hayes(Car)  Hayes left with a groin injury Sunday and his status
for next week is  uncertain. He's a vital part of the offense and will be
missed if he can't  go.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) As the  Jets have struggled, so has Chrebet. He
turned in another small game  Sunday with 22 yards on 2 catches. These
numbers just won't get it done  for a #1 WR.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) 2 weeks  ago, it was Amani Toomer taking the hard
shot. Last week it was Hilliard  with the highlight hit. He looks like he
may miss a game or two which is  bad news for Hilliard owners but good news
of Joe Jurevicius  owners.



TEs Moving Down

TE Reggie Kelly (Atl) Kelly's  just too up and down to rely on to any
degree. When he's featured in the  gameplan, he'sa nice player and can be
effective. It's just that  it's so hard to guess what game that will be...

TE Anthony Becht (NYJ) Another  Jet receiver that's struggling. Becht is
frustrating as he'll show some  nice flashes and then disappear for long
stretches. I'm afraid to say he's  starting to look like...a Jet's TE.
