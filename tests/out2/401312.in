Hey!  I think I'm planning to come to Austin sometime on Sat.  Bill won't be
coming with me because he has 3 trial settings on July 3, what a drag.  I
will probably go home on Mon. afternoon.  Our friends are having their lake
house party on the 4th.  Tell Jim to bring his gear and we'll go hit some.
Can't wait to see Gbug!  You know Mema is going to be really excited to see
her eat carrots.  (I think she's coming in on Sunday.)

I was regressing yesterday and found this website, which I think you would
appreciate also:

See you soon!
