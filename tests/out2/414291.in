I just got an update from the OMLX of their rules.  Do you need me to make
you a copy or are you also getting updates?  Also, I get faxes of all their
notices.  So far nothing I've received has been interesting.  Do you get
copies of their notices?  Do you need me to send you anything I feel is worth
noting?

They've also promoted me to Compliance Director, so I'm going to go in and
ask Mark for a raise to match my title!
