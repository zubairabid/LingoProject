Renee-
I understand your need to incorporate the actual changes into the change
order itself as opposed to an attachment.    After reading GE's (Jeff
Darst's) document, I can't easily extract from it what you need.  I need to
write something from scratch.  Instead of trading several emails with
yourself and Jeff Darst, it would be more efficient for me to give Jeff a
call myself to come up with something acceptable to the both of us which also
meets your requirements below.  (I'm thinking that the actual scope items
should be in your change order and GE's requirements/recommendations for the
future modifications can be attached -- Much the same way their standard
specs are attached to a purchase contract. )
I'm in Austin today and tomorrow (Thursday) and will be back in the office on
Friday.  If you can't wait, or need to talk to me before that, give me a call
on my cell phone (713) 412-6873.
