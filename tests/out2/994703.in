Ben,
Went up to Philly for the holiday. Jeanne and I hung out at Gioffre's on
Sunday for the Eagles-Redskins game.  He is doing well. Spoke with JV, he is
still enjoying being single and grabbing everything he can.
We are going skiing in PA in January, and we hope to go out west sometime
this ski season.  Actually, McGrath and Dolan are living in San Fran and
they said they might get a house for the ski season somewhere.  Sounds like
a good time.
I think 'W' will pull it off.  This whole thing is a crazy mess and I can't
wait for it to be done.  Gore was actually scary last night on TV.  I can't
believe the D's nominated him as their candidate.
Let us know if you are coming to DC. Talk to you later.
Luke
