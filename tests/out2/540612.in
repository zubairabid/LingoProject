Jennifer,

I hope you are doing well in the U.K., as my clock here says it is probably
about 4:52pm in London...Here is an update on BMC:

Based on the following, I would say this:

1)  BMC has worked to clear up operational problems experienced by Net Works,
and in one situation, appears to have done so successfully.
2)  Net Works has not acknowledged that the results of #1 were desired or
acceptable, and instead offered another pushback (Win2K certif'ctn), therefore
3)  BMC doesn't appear to have been given further opportunity to identify
what issues, if any, are still open at Net Works.
4)  I don't see evidence (either in these notes OR having come out from any
of the many telephone conversations I've been in) that Net Works has provided
any responses since 11/21 or so...Peter Goebel and I met w/Net Works & EBS on
11/17, and I have had no calls or e-mails responding to my requests for
information relative to "what are your top 3 problems in this BMC situation,
Net Works?" from Net Works.
5)  So, I feel confident that there are more issues (left off the table by
Net Works) than will be discussed, because
6)  Net Works doesn't want any of BMC's solutions.  Period.

7)  The Result:  EBS is on their own on their deal with BMC, as far as Net
Works' folks are concerned.

In the "I don't want any surprises" mode, I thought I'd give George a
heads-up re:  possible fallout around the BMC thing.  I told George in this
morning's staff meeting what Jim Crowder said to the EBS origination team ("I
don't see a problem here..."), and what you and I suggested EBS do - buy and
implement $1M of BMC's stuff, pay $2M for "credit", which any ENE business
unit could access, etc.  I also informed him that the EBS and BMC folks were
likely to encourage Crowder to "lean on" Philippe (which I had recommended
against).  George said he would take it up w/Jennie Rub.

If you have any questions, please let me know.
Jeff
