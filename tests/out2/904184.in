Internet Tip of the Day

HoaxKill

There are several good Net-hoax sites. HoaxKill is one of them. HoaxKill was
created "to help you identify hoaxes and to actively combat them." It debunks
Net myths and legends, virus hoaxes, chain letters, e-mail fundraising hoaxes
and scams, and the like. It also lists common jokes and related Net culture.
It offers links to related sites.

This is a handy site to bookmark. The next time you receive an e-mail chain
letter, a suspicious virus warning, an inspiring story of unusual courage, or
a heads-up about an outrage, check with HoaxKill first. There's a good chance
it's bogus. Several online friends-o-mine are somewhat susceptible to such
communiqu,s, particularly those prompting political outrage. HoaxKill can nip
'em in the bud.

Atlantis Massif, a 12,000-ft underwater mountain much taller than its
neighbors. Amtrak has high hopes for its 150-mph Acela Express train.
Researchers say the ability of monkeys to control robot arms wired to their
brains could mean hope for paralysis victims. Inuit in the Canadian Arctic
say they're sure the world is getting warmer. They're not alone -- Pacific
marine species are essentially saying the same thing. A study comparing human
and mouse genes sheds light on "impriinting." And stargazers will have no
opposition to the rare spectacle of Saturn and Jupiter in close "opposition"
to the Earth -- their closest approach to our planet. Click  here to read
