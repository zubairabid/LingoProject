Comments on above agreement:

Has Herman Manis or an ENA transaction support person read this agreement and
signed off?

1.B. - Realistically, ESA will not be ready to execute their ESA Option by
November 12th.  We are negotiating w/ WestLB to extend our facility until
Dec. 31, 2000.

1.C. - The ESA Option Consideration does not read like an "option payment"
nor do the amounts look like option premiums.  This section needs to be
vetted with ENA and ESA transaction support to insure that there are no
problems.  Our normal option requirements with vendors may not be required
here since internal and all assets already off balance sheet.

1.C. - As the WestLB facility is currently drafted, ESA would have to provide
us their "purchase option election" by tomorrow, Oct. 12th.  I am having that
extended in the current Nov. 12 maturity deal until 5 - 10 days before Nov
12th.  WestLb has not agreed to this yet.  The purchase date can be 5 days
after we provide notice of purchase under the WestLB facility, but no later
than Nov.12 currently.  In any case, ESA must give ENA notice no later than
our required notice date and doesn't have to, at this point, provide money
and purchase the equipment 5 days thereafter.  Just explaining the deal so
you know what leeway there is for negotiating the purchase date.

1.D. - Conflicts with language in 7.  I thought the arrangement was that as
soon as ESA purchased the equipment from ENA, new purchase contracts drafted
to take ENA out of the agent loop for those assets.  In ESA's deal, they will
be the Agent of the equipment on behalf  of the SPV/Owner.

2.A & B. - The GE Change Order and ABB Change Order as defined don't describe
the actual turbines and transformers, do they?  I thought the Change Orders
were for ancillary equipment.

3.A.2. - To clarify, add "paid to ABB" after "option premiums".

3.B.3. - Insert a "." at end of section.

4. - Delete.  This is not an option for ESA any longer.

7. - See 1.D. above.
