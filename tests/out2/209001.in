In conjunction with Enron Earth Day, Enron is sponsoring Trash Bash an annual
one-day event dedicated to cleaning up rivers, lakes, bays and bayous in
Houston and the surrounding areas, March 31st. Mike Terraso, Vice President,
Environmental Health and Safety, has endorsed this important initiative.

We have committed to adopting Buffalo Bayou, a three-mile stretch running
from Shepherd to Allen's Landing downtown, which has never been an official
site before in the event's entire eight-year history!  A planning committee
is being formed and you can become a part of the leadership team that will
coordinate the entire event from Sam Houston Park.  Please contact Charla
Reese as soon as possible via e-mail if you are interested.

Want to be a clean-up volunteer at Trash Bash?  Click here to PRE-REGISTER:

are employed by Enron as we are about to issue a challenge to our corporate
neighbors to see who has the largest team!  Also, if you are interested in
signing up your entire group, we can even arrange for canoes as it's the
perfect opportunity for a team-building activity as supplies and lunch will
be provided.  This is also a great time to get friends and family to be Enron
Envolved.  For questions related to participating in the clean-up, please
contact Jessica Nunez via e-mail.
