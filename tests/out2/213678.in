Rick - Here is a final copy of the NJN LOI  that was executed ie fuel cells.
I'm excited about this because although NJN is a smaller LDC , this deal was
cut at the highest levels (Pres/CFO) of their organization and has solidified
an already solid regulatory relationship.  Larry Downes has all but assured
me that  the gas asset deal is next!   Hope all is well.  See u Thursday.
