Quotes of the  Week

"But, again, I don't know anything other than when it's  fourth down, I punt.
That's as much as I know as far as anything having to do  with anything."
-- Pittsburgh Punter Josh Miller on  not understanding how the NFL could fine
Regan Upshaw so much for spitting on  him.

"Yeah, we stood because it was time to go out for  practice." One (wisely)
unnamed Washington Redskin player  whooffers a different spin onowner Danny
Snyder's report that the  team gave new coach Terry Robiskie a "standing
ovation".

"The man is 28 years old. It would have been like voting for  my
grandfather." -- Oakland CB Charles Woodson on  why he didn't vote for
FSU's Chris Weinke for the Heisman.

"If I wanted to change my desk, I'm going to call him and say  I want to
change my desk," Interim Redskin Coach Terry  Robiskie who's honest enough
to speak the truth.

''As long as there are Girl  Scouts, they're going to sell cookies. As long
as I'm playing football, I'm  going to cut. So there's no sense in crying
about it.'' Tampa Bay  Guard Frank Middleton talking about a season ending
cut block  he put on Bills player.on a block that put Buffalo linebacker on
the sidelines  for the remainder of the season.

Weather This Week. Once again, we  check in with our Cheatsheets.net
Meteorologist, Mike McVay. Mike's not  only a Meteorologist with WOWK - TV
but he's also a Fantasy Football  Fanatic. What a combination. Like I do
with my Physician friends  when I need an injury insight, we'll be calling on
Mike to give us some headsup  on the weather situations in a few notable
games this week. Thanks  Mike!

SEATTLE @ DENVER: Winter Storm Watch  for Sunday in Colorado, but I still
think the snows will hold off until at least  the 2nd half if not after the
game completely. I'd feel comfortable  starting any player in this one at
this point.

(Joe's note: Make sure to realize though that it'll  still be bitterly cold
with gusty winds likely.)

DETROIT @ GREEN  BAY: The big weather factor in this one is not the snow,
but the  cold. Snow flurries with temperatures in the 20s at kickoff that
will  likely fall into the teens by game's end. The Packers (and their
crazed  "cheeseheads") don't seem to mind these weather conditions, but keep
in mind  that Detroit plays in a dome.

CAROLINA @ KANSAS  CITY: The rain, sleet and snow will not arrive in Kansas
City  until late in the day on Sunday. This is an early game and so weather
no  longer seems to be a concern. However, falling thermometers and
barometers  are not good for sore bones and joints. This could still be a
tough day  for Grbac whose still being bothered by his thumb.

Now for this week's Updated Players in the News

Quarterbacks in the  News:

QB Jake Plummer (Ari) has sore ribs,  but expects to start this week. He
practiced in a reduced role on  Thursday.

*** Saturday Update QB Jake Plummer's (Ari)  chances of playing are looking
bleakfor Sunday's game. His  ribs are still very sore and it'll be a
gametime decision on whether he can go.  Even if he does play, he's a huge
risk as one good shot could send him  out. If he does sit, Dave Brown gets
the start.

QB Cade McNown (Chi) could probably  play this week if needed. He is not
expected to start. Shane Matthews again will get the call  behind center.

QB Scott Mitchell (Cin) starts for the  Bengals this week. Akili Smith will
back him up.

QB Spergon Wynn (Cle) has a bone bruise  that may hold him out of the rest of
this year,s games. He is only listed as  questionable, but will probably be
downgraded on Friday. Doug Pederson will start this week with  his sore ribs.

*** Saturday Update QB Spergon Wynn (Cle) is  out for the year and has been
placed on Injured Reserve. I hope this  doesn't effect your team.

QB Randall Cunningham (Dal) appears as  questionable with a sore groin, but
he is expected to backup Troy Aikman this  week.

QB Brian Griese (Den) will miss another  game and may not be ready to play
the last game of the regular season as earlier  reported.

QB Charlie Batch (Det) practiced on  Wednesday with his sore ribs and is
expected to start this  week.

QB Mark Brunell (Jac) has a bruised  shoulder, but it isn,t bad enough to
appear on the injury report. He starts this  week.

QB Drew Bledsoe (NE) is expected to  start with his injured thumb. He
practiced on Thursday.

QB John Friesz (NE) will be available  to play with his sore knee if needed.

QB Kordell Stewart (Pit) will start  despite a sore calf. He has been one of
the hottest quarterbacks of  late.

QB Moses Moreno (SD) can play if  needed. He will backup starter Ryan  Leaf.

QB Brock Huard (Sea) is still bothered  by his bruised kidney. Jon Kitna
will start in his place.

QB Shaun King (TB) practiced on  Wednesday despite a sore groin. He is
expected to start.

QB Steve McNair (Ten) missed practice  Thursday and at best will be a
gametime decision. If Steve cannot go, Neil O,Donnell will start in his
place.

*** Saturday Update QB Steve McNair (Ten)  did some practice work Friday.
It's still a gametime decision but  it'slooking more like he'll go Sunday.
He's a tough bird.

QB Jeff George  (Was) starts over Brad  Johnson this week.

Running Backs in the  News:

RB Thomas Jones (Ari) is questionable  with a virus, but is expected to be ok
by gametime.

*** Saturday Update RB Thomas Jones (Ari)  practiced well late this week and
looks to be good to go.

RB Michael Pittman (Ari) is  questionable with a sore toe, but expects to
start this week.

RB Sammy Morris (Buf) was able to  participate in a limited practice on
Wednesday. He is hopeful he can play on  Monday night. If he can go, he will
start. If he can,t go, look for Shawn Bryson to get the majority of  carries.

RB William Floyd (Car) is out with  broken ribs.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car) is  doubtful with his toe. He will likely be
deactivated this week. Brad Hoover again starts in his  place.

*** Saturday Update RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka  (Car) has been deactivated for
this week.

RB Corey Dillon (Cin) missed practice  on Wednesday, but is not listed on the
injury report. He is expected to play  Sunday.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle) is expected to  play with his sore shoulder. He
continues to split time with Jamel White.

RB Chris Warren (Dal) was released for  arguing with a coach and quickly
picked up by the Philadelphia Eagles. He is not  expected to make a big
contribution this week.

RB Michael Wiley (Dal) will backup Emmitt Smith now that Chris Warren has
been  released.

RB Terrell Davis (Den) is out again  this week.

RB Mike Anderson (Den) practiced on  Thursday with his sore knee and is
expected to start on  Sunday.

RB Dorsey Levens (GB) is out this week.  Ahman Green will again start in his
place.

*** Saturday Update RB Fred Taylor (Jac)  after some great games had me
beginning to like the guy. He falls back to my  prior opinion of him as he's
now decided he needs to renege on the contract he  signed as he's not being
paid enough... Save yourself the time if you want  to send a differing
opinion on this one. Demanding new contracts when you  perform like you
promised you would is one of my pet peeves and you won't change  my mind.

RB Tony Richardson (KC) is the starting  tailback. Donnell Bennett will
block  for him as the fullback.

RB J.R. Redmond (NE) practiced on  Wednesday, but was not involved in any
contact drills. He will likely split time  with Kevin Faulk this  week.

RB Raymont Harris (NE) has signed with  the Patriots.

*** Saturday Update RB Patrick Pass (NE) has  been deactivated for this week.

*** Saturday Update RB Raymont Harris (NE)  spent time with the first unit
this week and may see significant  playing time. I put absolutely nothing
past Bill Belichick. I refuse to be  surprised by anything he does.

RB Ricky Williams  (NO) is out with a broken fibula.

RB Terry Allen (NO) got the snaps in  practice on Wednesday and may
contribute more this week as Chad Morton and Jerald Moore are both listed as
doubtful.

*** Saturday Update RB Terry Allen  (NO)looks toget the start Sunday with
Morton and Moore less  than 100%.

RB Joe Montgomery (NYG) appears on the  injury report as questionable with a
sore thigh. He isn,t likely to play with Ron Dayne and Tiki Barber both
healthy.

RB Richie Anderson (NYJ) is expected to  play with a sore finger.

RB Tyrone Wheatley  (Oak) has a broken finger on his left hand and is being
called  questionable. Some are speculating the bad finger was behind the 2
fumbles  last week.

*** Saturday Update RB Tyrone Wheatley  (Oak) is the subject of a lot of
back and forth info. Some  reports have the finger as broken, some do not.
Some have his finger  troubles as the reason for his fumbles last week, some
don't. I take everything  form the Raider with a grain of salt. If I owned
Wheatley, I'd probably  feel ok starting him this week.

RB Darnell Autry  (Phi) is banged up with a sore shoulder and calf, but he is
expected to  start.

RB Chris Warren was signed by the  Eagles.

*** Saturday Update RB Chris Warren  (Phi) was not one of the early
deactivations so he's holding out for  the chance he gets to suit up this
week and see the field. He could be a  factor eventually, but starting him
this week isa large gamble as you just  don't know how he'll be used. Also
keep in mind the Eagles are on their  bye next week.

RB Jerome Bettis (Pit) missed practice  on Wednesday with a sore glute. He
expects to start this week.

RB Terrell Fletcher (SD) missed  practice on Wednesday with sore ribs, but is
expected to play this  week.

RB Rickey Watters (Sea) may see his  carries slighted this week as the team
starts to explore what they have with Shaun Alexander.

*** Saturday Update RB Ricky Watters (Sea)  is nursing a sore big toe. He
hasn't practiced all week but still says  he'll be able to go Sunday. Says
coach Mike Holmgren, ''I think he'll be  able to play,'' ''I think he's
going to be OK.''

RB Garrison Hearst (SF) is listed as  doubtful with a sore ankle. He is not
expected to play the rest of this  season.

*** Saturday Update RB Charlie Garner  (SF) catches a break as Saints DT
Norman Hand looks to miss the  game.

RB Mike Alstott (TB) is out with a sore  knee. Warrick Dunn continues to get
additional looks in his absence.

RB Stephen Davis (Was) may be injured  with a sore arm, but he knows he is
likely to have a field day running against  the Cowboys. He will start this
week and have a lot of  opportunities.

RB Larry Centers (Was) will play  through his knee pain.

////////////////////////////////////

Wide Receivers in the  News:

WR David Boston (Ari) missed practice  on Wednesday with a sore hamstring. He
is not listed on the injury report though  and expects to play this week.

*** Saturday Update WR David Boston (Ari)  continued to miss practice this
week. But I'm hearing very little about  it. I'd think he's good to go but
I don't like the idea of him missing  that much time.

WR Jermaine Lewis (Bal) practiced  through the pain of sore ribs and will
likely play this week.

WR Isaac Byrd (Car) is expected to play  with his sore hamstring. He will be
the team,s number 3 receiver behind Muhsin Muhammad and Donald Hayes.

WR Marcus Robinson (Chi) was placed on  injured reserve and is lost for the
season.

WR Peter Warrick (Cin) will get his  contact lenses on Thursday.

WR David Patten (Cle) is expected to  play with his sore shoulder.

WR Ed McCaffrey (Den) has a few  ailments, but nothing that will keep him off
the field this week.

WR Brian Stablein (Det) is not expected  to play this week with a sore knee.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) is expected to  play, but not start this week.
Herman  Moore and Johnnie Morton will  start for at least another week.

this week according to coach Moeller.

WR Corey Bradford (GB) is out again  this week and may not play again this
year.

WR Antonio Freeman (GB) is expected to  play with his sore back. He practiced
on Thursday.

WR EG Green (Ind) is questionable with  a sore knee. No decision yet has been
made to whether he will play on Monday  night.

WR Leslie Shepherd (Mia) is not  expected to play this week. Tony  Martin and
Oronde Gadsden will  start.

*** Saturday Update WR Leslie Shepherd (Mia)  has been deactivated for this
week.

WR Troy Brown (NE) appears on the  injury report as questionable.

WR Jake Reed (NO) is out with a broken  fibula. Willie Jackson plays in his
absence.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) practiced both  Wednesday and Thursday , but is still
questionable to start. He is having  difficulty breathing so even if he does
play he will likely be  limited.

*** Saturday Update WR Ike Hilliard (NYG)  looks to play this week and maybe
even start. At the least, he will be the  #3 WR behind Joe Jurevicius who's
played well filling in for Hilliard.

WR Laveranues Coles (NYJ) is not  expected to play this week. Dedric  Ward
will start in his place.

WR Wayne Chrebet (NYJ) is expected to  play with a bruised throat.

WR Courtney Hawkins (Pit) missed  practice on Wednesday with a sore knee and
remains questionable for the weekend  game.

WR Hines Ward (Pit) is expected to play  with his sore ankle.

WR Jeff Graham (SD) missed Wednesday,s  practice and is listed as doubtful on
the injury report. If he cannot go, look  for Trevor Gaylor to start in his
absence.

*** Saturday Update WR Jeff Graham (SD)  appears to have a 50 / 50 chance of
playing this week after suffering a serious  mouth injury last week.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) delivered as  promised last week and now looks close to
100%. He does not appear on the injury  report this week. He will start.

*** Saturday Update WR Terrell Owens (SF)  went full bore in practice and
apparently paid the price Friday as he was unable  to practice with pain and
swelling in the toe. He'll likely contribute and  may even start, but things
are not quite as optimistic as they were Thursday  evening. Although they're
better than last week.

WR/KR Tony Horne (StL) is out this  week.

WR Keyshawn Johnson (TB) practiced on  Thursday and will start on Sunday.

WR Albert Connell (Was) still has a  sore knee, but will start this week.
James Thrash will lineup in the other  spot with Irving Fryar moving to the
#3 slot.

WR James Thrash (Was) is expected to  play with his sore thigh.

Tight Ends in the  News:

TE Terry Hardy (Ari) is questionable  with a sore quadricep. He did not
practice on Wednesday, but expects to practice  later in the week and play on
Sunday.

TE OJ Santiago (Cle) is not expected to  see much playing time with his new
team with a sore knee. He is listed as  questionable this week. The fact that
he is playing for his third team this  season makes him look "suspect and
questionable" to me.

*** Saturday Update TE David LaFluer (Dal)  appears to be less than 100% as
he missed practice this week.

TE Desmond Clark (Den) practiced on  Thursday with a cast on his forearm. He
is expected to play on  Sunday.
