Rick --
The information below is very helpful for Government Affairs across the
country.  I have a few other questions to support our advocacy:
1. How much of our new power plant development is not subject to Building &
Construction Trade Labor Agreements?
2. Does Enron have any specific policies on whether or not we should use
Union labor on our construction?  We recently established human rights and
environmental policies, I am wondering if this applied to Unions?
3. Do you know if the pipelines are also using Union labor on their
expansions?  Or maybe, who could tell me?
Thanks.
Jim
