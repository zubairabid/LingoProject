CBE, Inc is cancelling their contract with ENA for Meter 11480 Equitrans
production effective July 1, 2000.

The only production which we have for July forward should be:
1.  Braxton Oil & Gas
2.  Bill Kennedy
3.  Aurora
I do not want to cancel their contracts untill we are sure that we do not owe
Equitrans for any past negative imbalances.

Cindi, when you nom for July, let me know the volume and I will try to sell
the gas to Dominion.

John
