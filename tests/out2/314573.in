Lisa,
Thank you for the timely comments.
Credit support.  On the issue of credit support for a project company
partially owned by Enron, ABB has some concerns even when Enron still holds
an equity interest due to some late payment problems they had in the past
with an Enron project company.  Also, the ABB and GE payment schedules are
different, with GE being more front end loaded. For example, GE will have
received 45% of the total payments due by the time the first 4 units are
ready to ship; by the time the last 6 units are ready to ship, they will have
received 95% of the payment.  In contrast, we hold 25% of the price of each
ABB unit until delivery (15%) and acceptance (10%) of that particular unit.
Effective date.  The typical reason for an earlier effective date is to
capture any work which ABB may have chosen to do during the option period in
order to hold their guaranteed completion dates.  In the GE contract we
addressed the issue in section 30.3, stating that it governs all work
performed pursuant to the agreement in principle. It is fine with me to make
the effective date a current one.
Price change. I will confirm why the prices changed $78,000 from the latest
option agreement. I suspect there were changes in the specifications since
the data sheets have changed.
Hope this was helpful.
