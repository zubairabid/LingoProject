Netting Agreement 96019013:  This is Happy Netting - No Paper Exist for this
Agreement.  The notes on the Core Main Tab  indicates this.
Parking 96016654:  I spoke with  Sandra Grimes at Oasis Pipe Line Company and
she indicated that this contract did not exist in their system.  They do not
have any documentation.  Their contract nos. start with 028......she is not
aware of OPLC Synthetic as their contract no..  Therefore,  the other Parking
and Loan Agreements effective May 1, 2000 are not the same contract.
Further, the documented status confirms that no paper exist and was setup in
completely.
I will probably terminate this contract in Global Contracts becasue it
appears that it was setup in error. In fact, the contract does not have
contracted services.
Should you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
