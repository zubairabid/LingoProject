I understand that SDG&E has a filing that is setting the new rates for 2001.
My hunch is that they are establishing a CTC rate to overcollect.  That
overcollection will then be used to offset the costs of the cap.  SDG&E has
the incentive to overcollect such that they can apply the amounts against the
undercollections for the cap in order to mitigat their shareholder risks.
The concern is that SDG&E is using ratemaking accounting to subsidize a
service that does not benefit all customers, in particula large customers
which we are serving.
