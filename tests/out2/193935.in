John,

This just got sent and it appears you were left of the cc list.  We will be
discussing with your guys this week to determine the best way forward.
Everyone is under earnings pressure and it is asking too much for someone to
dedicate 10-20% of their time on a product.  The intent of this email is not
to take people but to add people to the offices, if necessary, to make sure
they live, eat and drink weather.

We can discuss when I'm in later this week.

Mike
