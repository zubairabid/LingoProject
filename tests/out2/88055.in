As you may have gathered by now, the West Origination Group has purchased
season tickets to see the Portland Trail Blazers on their path to
championship glory. We have four seats which will be used primarily to
entertain customers and foster outside business relationships.

Please look over the attached schedule and determine the game dates you would
like to reserve. Tickets will be distributed on a first-come first-serve
basis, so be sure to plan as far in advance as possible. Games that have not
been reserved as of three days prior will be distributed internally or given
to outside parties.



If you have any questions or would like to reserve tickets, please contact
Blazer Command Central by e-mail, telephone, or in person. Include the date
of the games you would like to go to and the name of the customers you will
be taking.
