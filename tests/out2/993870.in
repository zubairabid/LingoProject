Yahoo! Unveils Yahoo! Webcast Studio; New Webcast Production Platform
Streamlines Delivery of Rich, Interactive Events

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec 13, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Yahoo! Inc (Nasdaq:YHOO)
today unveiled the Yahoo!(R) Webcast Studio, a new platform that will enhance
the flexibility and delivery of Internet broadcast events through greater
automation and production efficiencies. Yahoo! Webcast Studio combines the
entire suite of Internet broadcasting services and tools that Yahoo! provides
for thousands of companies each year through Yahoo! Broadcast's streaming
services.

Yahoo! Webcast Studio enhances Yahoo!'s turnkey Internet broadcasting services
by streamlining the process to produce and deliver branded Webcasts over the
Internet or corporate intranets. The robust production engine can rapidly
deliver a custom Webcast that includes the following:


--  An embedded video window;

--  Synchronized data window;

--  Embedded browser; and

--  All of the interactive tools that are currently offered
through Yahoo! Broadcast.

New features that Yahoo! Webcast Studio builds into the broadcast include:


--  Automatic detection of the end-user's media player;

--  Automatic detection of the end-user's optimal bandwidth; and

--  Automatic slide synchronization feature allowing the archive
of the live event to be available as soon as the live event
has ended.

"Mass customization of Webcast production and delivery is now upon us," said
Stan Woodward, vice president of Business Services for Yahoo!. "With this new
production engine, we are bringing all of our experience and capabilities to
one
platform. We believe this is the future for Webcasting and expect potential
applications such as corporate broadcasting centers and self-serve Webcasting
for experienced, high-end customers will grow from this powerful new
platform."

Digital Planet recently used the Yahoo! Webcast Studio platform for rapid
production and delivery of the live Webcast for the post-premiere party of
Universal's "How The Grinch Stole Christmas." Viewers of the live Webcast were
able to enjoy actor interviews, movie clips, e-mail questions, and purchasing
of
movie products and Dr. Seuss books through Yahoo!'s commerce-enabling
capabilities.

"The production and streaming of The Grinch post-premiere party Webcast
couldn't
have been better. In less than 48 hours we were broadcasting over the Internet
the exact look, feel, and features we wanted for this exclusive event," said
Steven Chester, President of Digital Planet.
