Earlier this year, the Enron Fleet Strategic Sourcing Initiative outlined a
goal of saving $1.2 million, or 15 percent, on vehicle and related expenses.
To provide GPG the ability to realize the savings potential associated with
these recommendations, it is necessary to implement a standardized GPG Fleet
Procedure.

The GPG Fleet Procedure and associated Addenda address the recommendations of
the Enron Fleet Strategic Sourcing Team and establish a solid foundation to
build a world class fleet.  The key points of the GPG Fleet Procedure are:

Procurement ) Sets budget guidelines and optimal lifecycle of the fleet.
Vehicle Assignment ) Identifies employees who will be assigned a Company
vehicle, Runzheimer or rental car.
Commute  ) Tracks and identifies those costs associated with commute miles.
Minimum Utilization ) Identifies minimally utilized assets for redeployment
or disposal.
IFTA Fuel Permitting ) Lists steps necessary to comply with this program.
Vehicle Tracking ) Details use of the electronic transfer form including
registration information.
Vehicle Remarketing ) Outlines procedure to dispose of surplus vehicles and
work equipment.
Vehicle Take Home Procedure ) Identifies employees who can drive a Company
vehicle to their home.
Runzheimer Program ) Outlines program parameters and associated requirements.
Registration and Title Management ) Explains proper procedures to assure the
registration process.
Driver Motor Vehicle Report ) Prehire/transfer program used to screen
prospective employees/transfers
One Card Program ) Outlines requirements for fuel and maintenance program.

GPG and its, employees will benefit from the savings generated by the
recommendations of the Strategic Sourcing Initiative. We encourage each
employee to continue to make sound business decisions each day, decisions
that allow GPG to take full advantage of savings opportunities.

In the near future, we will be introducing the &One Card8 (MasterCard)
program.  This card will be used for vehicle fuel and maintenance expenses as
well as emergency purchases.  The GPG Fleet Procedure as well as the One Card
Procedure will soon be posted on the Enron GPG Intranet.
