Latest NBA Player News

Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00
O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him to
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  He
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of his
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go by
total points.

Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if
possible.

Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon.
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by Dec.
20 "at the latest".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up.
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy
when he returns before you pick him up.

Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When he
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you
to let him go.

Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00
Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want to
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.

Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00
Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one of
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game to
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.

Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00
Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00
Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill should
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.

Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis in
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another
viable option is open to you.

Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/11/00
Marbury, who has missed New Jersey's last four games with a sprained ankle,
expects to return to the court for the Nets' Tuesday night contest against
his former team, the Minnesota Timberwolves. "I'm playing Tuesday.
Absolutely," said Marbury. "I know it's going to hurt. I've gotten to the
point where I feel like I'm confortable."  Unless you have two solid guards
with four-game schedules, it would be wise to get Marbury back into your
starting lineup this week.

Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scoring
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to those
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit
Atkins if your roster allows it.

Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surgery
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Miller
and Brevin Knight.

Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00
Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games with
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes
occur.

Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00
Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on the
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reportedly
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who has
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.

Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over a
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a "leave" by the team
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds in
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.

Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00
The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.

Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00
The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on the
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the
injury.

Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00
Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.


Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00
Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a sprained
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewis
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but
doesn't have much Fantasy value.

Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primarily
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value.

Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game at
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use in
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.

Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily as
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.

Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotation
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.

Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positive
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder under
the current conditions.

Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injured
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.

Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rookie
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of the
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.

Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return to
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who was
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy value
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deeper
leagues.

Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00
Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting about
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the very
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00
Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court on
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, give
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.

Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00
Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but
has very little Fantasy value.
