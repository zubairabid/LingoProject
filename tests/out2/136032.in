As officers of the company, we would like to reiterate that we are all
responsible for conducting the business affairs of the Company in accordance
with all applicable laws and in a moral and honest manner.
At this particular point in time, we would like to revisit our Business
Ethics policy:
&Employees of the Company are charged with conducting their business affairs
in accordance with the highest ethical standards.  An employee shall not
conduct himself or herself in a manner, which directly or indirectly would be
detrimental to the best interests of the Company or in a manner, which would
bring to the employee financial gain separately derived as a direct
consequence of his or her employment with the Company.8
Please realize &conducting our business affairs in accordance with the
highest ethical standards8 should be reflected in all communications.  This
applies to communication via person to person, telephone, correspondence, fax
and e-mail.  We particularly want to address the importance of absolute
integrity in your communications via e-mail and any attached documents or
graphics.  If further clarification is needed, please contact your
Advisor/Director for any questions or concerns.  We are available to discuss
these issues as well.
The Code of Ethics was revised in July of this year and every employee was
asked to sign a new Certificate of Compliance statement.  This signed
statement serves as your personal agreement to comply with the policies set
forth during the term of your employment with the Company.  The Code of
Ethics booklet, and the Certificate of Compliance are avaliable to all
employees on the Enron Home Page at http://home.enron.com/.  You may access
them by clicking on Code of Ethics.
We are proud of Enron and we want it to continue to enjoy a reputation for
fairness and honesty that is respected.  Let,s keep that reputation high.
