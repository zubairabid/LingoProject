Weiss, Peck and Greer (WPG) has addressed the fee and margin issues noted in
my previous email.
Fees:  We will not be assessed any fees from WPG.  Thus, I suggest that
section 9 state this, or be removed.
Margin:  Section 14 should note that margin for our transactions through Buy
Side Direct would be maintained at our prime broker.  WPG would only request
margin if our prime broker disaffirms a trade.
Has the WPG attorney agreed to a time to discuss their agreement ?
Thanks.
