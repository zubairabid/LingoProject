Hey Tim:

Calger asked me recently to set up a meeting with Sempra to try to do a gas
outsource deal.  We're meeting with the CFO and their Chief Reg Officer next
Thursday.  On a call today, we thought--for a variety of reasons--that we
ought to throw an electric commodity deal at them, too, while we're there.
Laird Dyer's going to call you for indicative prices (same drill we did for
Skilling).  If you have any questions, or want me to fill you in more, just
give a holler, or check in with Chris.

Best,
Jeff
