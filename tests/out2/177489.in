GOP MOVES NATURAL GAS TO FRONT BURNER
Assembly Republicans join together once again to request Davis to call
special session.

(SACRAMENTO) ) Assembly Republicans united Monday in asking Governor Gray
Davis to call a special session of the California legislature to deal with
skyrocketing natural gas prices.

&Families and businesses are reeling every month from extraordinary gas
prices.  Pardon the expression, but the natural gas crisis no longer belongs
on California,s back burner,8 said Assembly Republican leader Bill Campbell
(R ) Villa Park).

Assembly Republicans unanimously signed a letter to Governor Gray Davis
asking for him to convene a special session of the legislature to deal with
California,s skyrocketing natural gas bills.  Republicans delivered the
letter to Davis this morning.

&A special session is both a symbolic and a practical necessity.  It tells
Californians that we care about their skyrocketing gas bills.  It tells
businesses everywhere that California is going to provide for its future
energy needs,8 said Campbell.  &Practically speaking, a special session also
allow us to pass legislation which can take effect immediately.8

Republicans believe the electricity and natural gas crises are inextricably
linked.

&California,s natural gas crisis is completely intertwined with its
electricity crisis,8 said Campbell.  &Any plan to deal with our electricity
crisis must have a natural gas component or Californians are going to pay
unacceptably high prices for both.8

Assembly Republicans believe the natural gas crisis has many fronts, all of
which could be addressed comprehensively by a special session.

&Natural gas issues include pipeline capacity, storage, exploration,
alternative fuels and conservation,8 said Campbell.  &A special session lets
us put together a comprehensive solution.8

&The private sector has the expertise and the capital to deal with these
issues if government would just get out of the way.  Republicans believe that
a legislative solution to the natural gas crisis should leave the resources
and primary decision-making to the private sector,8 said Campbell.
