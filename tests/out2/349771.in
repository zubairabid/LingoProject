Just to clarify.

The product that is traded in New York is a financial swap that settles
against the Day Ahead clearing price.  It is changes to HQ's physical
deliveries (0 to 1500 MW) into NY that can swing the clearing price by at
least $20.  This is not just due to the price that HQ sells their energy for,
but is mostly due to the impact on congestion in NY of HQ deliveries.  When
HQ is not delivering high volumes, NY is generally uncongested and the price
for the entire state is set by gas generation in the East.  When HQ delivers
high volumes, the system becomes congested and the west price is set by much
lower cost resources and the east price is set by gas generation.  The impact
on the NY West price (Zone A) is at least $15 dollars.  Since the majority of
the OTC trades are settled against this price, it gives HQ tremendous ability
to trade financially and then influence the settlement price.  Large
generators in New York west could also do this but it would be quite costly
for them to withhold 1000 MW of generation and this would be easily noticed.
HQ however, has hydro generation and can easily store their water for
delivery another day.

HQ trades directly in the New York OTC market as HQ Energy Services (US)
Inc..  The general market realizes the impact that HQ can have on the
clearing price and will often pull out of the market when HQ is trading.  I
have heard from a couple of sources that HQ is using Select to trade for them
to avoid this problem but I cannot confirm this.

Hope this helps clarify things.
