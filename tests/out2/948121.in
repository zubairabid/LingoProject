Hi Kevin:
I was out of the office on Thursday and Friday.   I have discussed this with
Vince Kaminski and he says the charges are correct.  Jason Sokolov
reports to Tanya Tamarchenko in the Research group and all of their
costs are charged to RAC.
If you need further verification, please contact Vince Kaminski at 3-3848.
Thanks!
