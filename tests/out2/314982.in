Attached is the latest draft of the MEH Risk Management Policy.  It has been
prepared in conjunction with and reviewed by Peoples' Risk Management
department.  Judy Pokorny will be presenting the salient points of the Policy
to Peoples' Risk Management Committee this week for their consideration and
approval.  Subject to any feedback from the Peoples' Risk Management
Committee, the Policy is near final approval.  Therefore, if there are any
comments or questions, please direct them to either me or Judy, as
appropriate.

Thanks,

Gregg
