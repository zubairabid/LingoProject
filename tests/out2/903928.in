Health & Fitness Tip of the Day
Tuesday December 12, 2000

Aerobic Exercising

While weightlifting builds muscles, aerobic exercises target your heart
muscle. Great forms of aerobic exercise are bike riding, running, rowing, or
brisk walking. Try performing aerobic exercises for at least 20 minutes a day
a few days a week and you will quickly see how much better you feel! Be sure
to talk to your doctor before you start any exercise regimen.
