the scrimmage is still up in the air...
webb said that they didnt want to scrimmage...
the aggies  are scrimmaging each other... (the aggie teams practiced on
Sunday)
when I called the aggie captains to see if we could use their field.... they
said that it was tooo smalll for us to use...
sounds like bullshit to me... but what can we do....
anyway... we will have to do another practice Wed. night....    and I dont'
know where we can practice.... any suggestions...
also,  we still need one  more person...
