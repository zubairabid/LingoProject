Further to our conversation, please see attachment regarding warranty and
netting.
Disregard the section on "Non-Warranted Gas" as this does not apply to our
negotiations.



Netting.  In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an
amount in the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each
Party may be aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to
pay through netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater
aggregate amount may pay to the other Party the difference between the
amounts owed.


Best regards,
