On Friday, January 26, 2001, an earthquake rocked the western region of
India. The earthquake reportedly had a magnitude of  7.9 and was centered in
the state of Gujarat.  Initial reports indicate the death toll to be at least
15,000. Most of the damage was reported in Ahmedabad, the state's commercial
center.

Enron has a significant business presence in India. It has E&P interests off
the Gujarat coast and is the majority owner of the Dabhol Power project,
ultimately a 2,184 MW (net) generating plant, serving consumers in the state
of Maharashtra, which borders Gujarat to the south. Consequently, Enron Oil
and Gas India Limited (EOGIL), Enron India and DPC have mobilized staff and
resources in India to tangibly assist the relief effort (e.g. contributing
emergency medical supplies).

Enron employees are encouraged to donate to relief efforts and to take
advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your
donation.  Enron will match, dollar for dollar, every donation that you make,
up to $15,000 annually per employee.  Listed below are a multitude of
organizations that are offering aid to the victims of this earthquake.  To
print a Matching Gift form, please click here << File:
http://home.enron.com/cr/ >>  and then click on gifts, grants and giving.
Please fill out the form and send it with your check to 3AC-1409.  We will
send the money collected, along with a check from Enron for the same amount,
to each of the organizations.  Please make sure to write "India" in the memo
area on your check.

If you have any questions, please contact Vanessa Bob via email.
Thank you, in advance, for your support!
