Enron Online Transactions
.  Any member of the Envera Network (an &Envera Network Member8) who is a
customer of EOL may submit to EGM an irrevocable offer to buy or sell any
petrochemical, natural gas liquids, or plastics product that is then traded
by EGM on EnronOnline, on the standard terms and conditions (including
without limitation quantity, quality, shipping dates and payment terms) as
are established for such products on EnronOnlinev, at a price that is between
the bid and ask prices then posted by EGM on EnronOnlinev, with such offers
being a binding commitment by such Envera Network Member to complete the
proposed transaction on the same trading day (as trading days are determined
by EGM).  EGM agrees to conditionally accept such offers, subject to the
following requirements and limitations:
Current Envera Network Members (as of the Closing Date) may submit such
offers on or before the first anniversary of the Closing Date, and not
thereafter.  Any Envera Network Member who first becomes a member after the
Closing Date but before December 31, 2001, shall have until the first
anniversary of its membership agreement with Envera in which to submit such
offers, but not thereafter.  Any Envera Network Member who first becomes a
member after December 31, 2001, shall not be entitled to submit any offers to
EGM under this Section 8.2.  All of EGM,s obligations under this Section 8.2
shall expire no later than December 31, 2002.
The irrevocable offer by the Envera Network Member must be placed as a limit
order on EnronOnlinev and made irrevocable until the end of the trading day
in writing (by facsimile or otherwise) or otherwise in accordance with the
standard confirmation procedures of EGM.  In no event will EGM be liable for
any failure to complete any limit order or trade.
The Envera Network Member must be a registered user of EnronOnlinev and
qualified to trade in the product that is the subject of the offer, all in
accordance with the standard terms established by EGM or EnronOnlinev.
EGM will accept or reject the offer on or before the close of the trading
day and will communicate such acceptance or rejection to the Envera Network
Member; if accepted the transaction will be completed through EnronOnlinev.
EGM's acceptance or rejection may be based on EGM,s ability to reverse the
trade with a third party or otherwise fully mitigate the risk created by the
trade, and on such criteria as EGM applies to such trades generally,
including without limitation its evaluation of the credit risk of such Envera
Network Member based on EGM's standard credit policies then in effect.
Any trades of similar products by EGM shall be independent of the
transaction offered by the Envera Network Member.  EGM's trades will be for
its own account and in no event shall EGM trade for or on behalf of the
Envera Network Member.
Neither EGM nor EOL will charge the Envera Network Member any transaction
fees with respect to such transaction.
The aggregate number of transactions that EGM will be obligated to accept
pursuant to this Section 8.2 shall not exceed one hundred (100) per Envera
Network Member, and shall not exceed an aggregate of five thousand (5,000).
No offers shall be accepted by EGM under this Section 8.2 after December 31,
2002.
No transactions under this Section 8.2 will be executed if, in the sole good
faith judgment of EOL or EGM, upon advice of its counsel, the result or
effect of which may be that any of EGM, EOL, or EnronOnlinev, their
Affiliates or any of their respective businesses (i) could become subject to
regulation under the Commodities Exchange Act, as amended; (ii) could become
subject to regulation by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission; or (iii)
could become subject to any regulatory proceeding, investigation, action,
inquiry or review.
