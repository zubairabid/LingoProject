Hi Mum!  So good to see you this weekend!  It was great to meet Eric; what a
sweet man.  Fun too!  I can see why you are so crazy about him!  Craig really
enjoyed meeting you also.

Our trip home was somewhat hair-raising but we made it back safely.

I can't believe I am still here at work!  Took a break to make my list for
you.  It is somewhat random.  Feel free to collaborate with K&J...

Love, Sooz
