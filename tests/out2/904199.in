Fact of the Day




American poet and novelist Sylvia Plath published her first poem at age eight
and while still in high school she sold her first poem to Seventeen magazine.
Plath is best known for her semi-autobiographical novel titled "The Bell Jar"
which was first published in 1963 under the pseudonym "Victoria Lucas."
Constantly haunted by anxiety and doubt, Plath took her own life later that
year. With the re-release of "The Bell Jar" under her own name in 1966, Plath
was able to posthumously secure a spot on the bookshelves of main stream
America. For more, click here.

Joke of the Day

Steve's a Jerk


Once upon a time there was a woman married to an annoying man named Steve. He
would complain about everything. That day he went to their creek with his
mule. He complained so much that the mule got annoyed and kicked him to
death.

At the funeral, when all the men walked by the wife she shook her head yes
and every time the women walked by she shook her head no.

The minister asked "Why are you shaking your head 'yes' for men and 'no' for
women?"

Her response was, "The men would say how sorry they felt for me and I was
saying, 'Yes, I'll be alright.' When the women walked by, they were asking if
the mule is for sale...."
