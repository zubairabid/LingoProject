Dear all,

I completeley agree with Ben that Treasuries are the most liquid and reliable
benchmarks. I also think that FMAs have their own advantages and
disadvantages.

However, it looks like it would be very difficult for us to avoid using LIBOR
as benchmark - at least to price anything related to Capital Markets (for
example, credit default swaps) . Our prices will always be different from
that on Capital Markets if we use benchmarks different from the Market.

As a half-way solution we can have different benchmarks - for example, use
anything, that we decide is closest to risk-free, to value products
significantly different from that priced on Capital markets,and LIBOR for
everything priced on Capital Markets .

We can adjust by manipulating other coefficients (event, liquidity,
recovery) for our purposes, but it looks like benchmark should be LIBOR.

To avoid negative default probabilites (for highly rated reference entities)
we can add cost fo repo and haircuts (as all bankers do).

Let us continue our discussion on this.

Slava
