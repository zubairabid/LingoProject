Good Afternoon Sara,
Here is the original confirmation created for the FX trade that took place on
9/26/00. The comments provided by Merrill are as follows:
1) The want to reflect "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc., New
York"(MLCSNY) rather than "Merrill Lynch International Bank" (MLIB).
2) They want to reference the Master Agreement dated 12/2/92 rather than
7/1/95
3) They want to change the wire instructions to correspond with Merrill Lynch
Capital Services, Inc., New York.
They penciled in there comments and returned the comments via fax.
The questions are as follows:
1) Is this acceptable?
2) If so, should we just countersign on the version wherein they made their
corrections and return to them?
3) If not, should we recreate a new confirm with the requested changes?
4) Going forward if there is a Merrill Lynch London trade, should we be using
MLCSNY or MLIB?
We have historically only booked Interest Rate Swaps with MLCSNY until now.
Looking forward to your response.
Have a great weekend!
Regards,
