Williams, Southern, Reliant and AES have filed motions to make the
protective order significantly stricter, and to stay the production of
documents until the protective order issues are resolved.  These generators
are taking a much harder line.  Counsel for Southern has advised me that
some of the generators may challenge a large part of the data request on
grounds of jurisdictional, burden, and trade secret intrusion.  It seems to
me that it may be best to let the generators fight for a stronger protective
order, and not take their side at this time.  We might well want to consider
proposing a "most favored nations clause" in our letter to the CPUC tomorrow
in order to take advantage of what ever tighter protective order is
eventually agreed to.  Generally, I feel the generators' stance will allow
us to be right where we want to be, not out front leading the charge, not
turning over everything right away, but instead making "just enough" of a
production to avoid being the center of attention.

I will forward the generators' pleadings to you as attachments to this
e-mail.  Gary, I believe, already has them.
