Rick, in the interest of preserving trees and keeping the information
reasonably controlled, I would distribute this to senior managment and the
portfolio managers in each origination group responsible for each investment.

Portfolio Managers

Steve Pruett - Energy Capital Resources - (E&P)
Chuck Ward - Generation Investments
Chris Helfrick - Industrials and Coal
Michael Miller - Principal Investing
Richard Lydecker - Restructuring
Ray Bowen - CTG
Andrea Reed - CTG
Wes Colwell - Controller
Jordan Mintz - Tax

Management

Jeff Skilling
Joe Sutton
Mark Frevert
Dave Delainey


I don't think we need to distribute this data farther.  The business unit
heads in the finance origination groups can access their portfolio manager
for the data if needed.

Regards
Delainey
