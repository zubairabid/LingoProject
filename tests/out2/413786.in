In response to your email, yes, our confidentiality language was so limited
that it did not allow us to provide the agreement to affiliates of either
party without consent.  We revised the form about 9 months ago to broaden the
langage to include affiliates, but Duke is an old master so they need our
consent so they can provide it to their affiliate.  Unless Federico has any
reason not to waive the language, I think we can go ahead & draft a waiver up
here and send it to Duke.  Can you talk to Federico asap and run that by him
and let me know so I can get this over to Duke.  Thanks!
