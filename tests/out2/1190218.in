David-
Thank you for passing the Australian GTC's on to us.  As to B&M's position on
the gambling issue, they are not prepared to provide us with a clean opinion,
however they will specify how we might minimize the associated risks, which
appear to be minimal.  I expect to receive their formal advice today and
will  forward same upon receipt.
The Enron company that is specified on the Passwords Applications and ETAs
that are being sent out is presently ENA.
Cheers,
