sparesFinder Friends

In their quarterly review, The Sunday Times  and Bathwick Group have ranked
sparesFinder at number 47 of Europe's top 100  e-businesses, dubbed the
"e-League". We are delighted to be named and to debut  more than half way up
the list. (For those of you receiving this message in  plain text, you can
find the e-League commentary page at
http://www.bathwick.com/ir/eleague/commentary.shtml)

Please note the mention we get in paragraph  two, as "a young company with a
great concept," in the update commentary below.  For the full review, just
click on the Top 100 and see sparesFinder at 47.  You'll also see us in The
Sunday Times itself when the e-League is printed in  the new year.

Coming on the heels of recent reviews from  Schroder Salomon Smith Barney and
Goldman Sachs, this is further good news and  endorsement for the
sparesFinder initiative. Thank you for your support  androle in helping make
this happen.

Brief commentary - October update
This update sees one notable exit ) that of  Boxman.com from no.20 last time
(August). Boxman had a good  management team, business model, cost control,
and customer base,  but was a victim of over-ambition and negative investor
sentiment in  the light of long or lengthening periods of losses. Others
will  probably follow over the coming months.

As with the last  update, though, there's more good news than bad ) new
entries  include a number of strong b2b companies, including
Sparesfinder.com, a young company with a great concept for cutting  costs for
heavy industries.

On a general note, The standard  of companies in the e-league (against which
all are judged)  continues to improve, and scores have been adjusted to
reflect the  improving average.

There are still some notable exceptions  that warrant a place in the league,
but from which we have been so  far unable to obtain sufficient data for the
assessment, including  many continental European companies such as
Chateauonline, and  Mercateo and other UK companies like Medexonline.

Future  developments will include more analysis of individual market sectors
and the addition of selected company profiles ) we will provide more  details
on this site over the next month.



The Sunday Times and The Bathwick  Group would like to extend their thanks to
the sponsors of the  e-League
