You raise a very interesting question on how EECC and ENA will interface in
the future.

I understand that ENA now has a Technical Support Group (something like
that), and some of the folks are EECC personnel who have transferred to ENA.
I do not know their function or role.

As for the integration of EECC legal comments into a document, I would say
that it would depend on the comment.  Essentially, the deals are ENA deals,
not EECC deals, which means ENA has decision making responsibility.  Also,
ENA is the project sponsor/owner (until sold), and NEPCO is usually the
contractor.  The conflicts arise when NEPCO (usually not EECC on ENA deals)
is asked to wrap certain contracts, so EECC or NEPCO takes a position as a
contractor.  So it is difficult for EECC to act as the owner's engineer and
the EPC contractor.

Another interface issue is that EECC contracts personnel do not typically
involve the EECC lawyers in major equipment contracts until the end of the
negotiation process.  Perhaps this has changed since I left, but that was how
things worked when I was with EECC.

On the finance/deal lawyer front, my question is who deals with the lenders
and their counsel once the financing vehicle is in place?

I'll let you know if I think of anything else.  I suspect Sheila will have
some insight, also.
