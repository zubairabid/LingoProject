Sheri:

The physical power products on DynegyDirect have now been approved, with the
exception of the West firm product.  Thus, go ahead and set up the East power
traders to trade physical power on behalf of EPMI.  Do not set up any West
traders to trade on DynegyDirect until you receive confirmation from me that
the West products are okay.

Please make clear to the power traders that they may trade ONLY physical
power with their EPMI passwords.  If they want to trade financial power
products, they must obtain an ENA password (since Enron North America, not
Enron Power Marketing is the Enron entity that trades derivative products).
There are a couple of changes to the power swaps currently posted that need
to be made before I can approve the issuance of passwords to trade financial
products (plus I want Brent Hendry's sign off as well).

The following lawyers must approve the commodity groups set out below before
you can proceed to set up additional users of Dynegy Direct:

Dan Hyvl:  Physical Gas
Marcus Nettelton:  Liquids  (products plus on-line General Terms and
Conditions to be approved)
Brent Hendry:  Financial Products

The ENA gas traders will only need to receive one password for physical and
financial products.  However, the liquids traders will, like the EPMI
traders, receive an EGL password for physical liquid products and an ENA
password for financial liquid products, and will need to be instructed that
they need to use the passwords accordingly.

Please do not hesitate to give me a call with any questions or comments.

Happy holidays!

Leslie
