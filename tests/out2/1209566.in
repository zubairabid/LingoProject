There is no time on Friday morning when everyone is available. However, in
order that we not let perfection be the enemy of the good, we will do a call
at 10:00 a.m. NY time with Raisler, Rosen, Dow, Davis and Architzel and a
second call at 11:00 for Tayor and Roger. If Robin or Mark can adjust their
sechedules, great, if not I will fill you in. I think your roles will be to
focus on product and potential trading issues (securities issues for Robin
and non financials for Mark). If necessary we will do another call.

I will follow up with a call-in number. You should have received Salzman's
panel materials. Please feel free to pass to Jerry any comments.

Is anyone planning to be at Rainer's farewell party Friday afternoon?
