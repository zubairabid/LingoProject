Enron Global Markets (EGM) has made numerous organizational changes as its
businesses continue to grow and expand around the world.  We are pleased to
announce the following changes within EGM.
Financial Trading
The Convertible Arbitrage desk has moved from EnronCredit.com to the
Financial Trading group under Gary Hickerson.  Mike Bradley will manage the
desk.
Billy Lemmons has joined Gary Hickerson's group from EIM.  He is exploring
the agriculture value chain and origination opportunities.
Transportation and Shipping
Dan Reck will be transitioning out of the coal group and will be exploring
our rail and trucking initiatives.  These markets together represent
approximately $105 billion notionally, and we believe there are many
synergies between our energy, coal, and freight trading businesses.
Enron is currently trading dry-freight through EOL and is a leading market
maker in this new product. The shipping business is growing very quickly.  We
have asked Pierre Aury and Scott Montcrief to co-lead our worldwide vessel
trading businesses.  Scott will be responsible for all liquids vessel
businesses and Pierre will manage all dry vessel businesses.  The LNG vessel
business currently managed by Wayne Perry will remain in the LNG group, but
will also report to and coordinate with Pierre and Scott.
Weather
Our worldwide weather operations will continue to report to Mark Tawney in
Houston.  This business, which includes trading weather products in 10
countries and 40 states in the U.S., is also rapidly expanding.  Mark will
have all V@R allocation responsibility between Sydney, Tokyo, Oslo, and
Houston.  In addition we will be forming a weather-marketing desk in London.
Crude and Products
Bill White will be coming over from EBS and will have responsibility for all
U.S. financial crude trading.  Don Schroeder will continue to have oversight
and lead our physical crude business.  Mario De La Ossa has joined EGM from
Equiva and will manage our product options book.
Doug Leach will be expanding his fuel management and origination role.  He
will report directly to John Nowlan.
Finance and Structuring
Andrew Makk has joined the finance team from the Middle East group.  Most
recently he has been working on the Gaza project.
Jim Lewis has also joined this team. His last assignment was leading the
structuring group for CALME.
Both Andrew and Jim will report to Larry Lawyer.

Mark Wadlington has joined the EGM team and will be managing this activity
and co-ordinating with all Enron Corp. He reports to Tim Detmering with
accountability to the office of the chairman of EGM.
Operations and Accounting

responsibility for coal and weather.
Mike Perun has joined Enron from the banking industry and is responsible for
Controls & Standards.  He will focus on EGM,s operational and accounting
processes on a global basis.  He reports to Brent Price.
