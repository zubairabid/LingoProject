This system was just implemented for ENA etal as a Global system.  We are
working on convincing Europe to incorporate into their EnVision plan.  There
could be potential to include this in the Commodity Logic family as a way to
aggregate and serve time series price information to users.  A direct
competitor of this product would be FAME Energy which I looked at earlier
this week.  On the surface, it would appear our system is more robust than
the one offered by FAME.
