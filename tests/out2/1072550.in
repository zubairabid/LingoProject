texas did go to a bowl last year and get run by an arkansas team (sec) that
was blanked 35-0 in their last regular season game against lsu.  big 12 can
say they are up this year, but the fact is there are only two teams playing
football in that conference, ou/nu.  the other teams in the big 12 attribute
their loses to a competitive conference from top to bottom.  i think they
should change the name of the conference to the big 2.  at least the sec is
full of good teams.  "the big 12 - you can't shine shit!"
