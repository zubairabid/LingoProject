I passed this information along to some of my direct reports for their
thoughts, and truthfully didn't hear back from anyone and didn't follow up.
Two years ago, we agreed to be part of a benchmarking study that was done by
AA's Houston office (interestingly enough, Wes Colwell was the AA partner who
led this effort) and we had mixed results.  The study was designed to cover
gas and power.  Despite our involvement in the steering committee, the study
itself was very, very detailed, such that it was troublesome to complete.
Jim Fallon at the time refused to submit information on the majority of the
questions surrounding power, so our survey data for power was not very
useful.
I would agree that at this time we will pass on this request.  Thanks for
passing it along, however.  I would be happy to convey this directly  to the
person that has contacted you.  Just let me know his/her name and number and
I will follow through on that if you would like.
