Chris --
I am not too optimistic that we are going to get either the CPUC or the
California Legislature to provide for competitive default supply.   I don't
think that the utilities would want it nor do I think that with all of the
other problems in California this will occur within the next 12 months.
The best chance is simply to get the utilities to recognize (as the call from
SCE appears to indicate) that there is price risk with their residual load
and to seek to forward contract.  We are working (and I think that there is a
strong sentiment amongst most California electricity wonks) to remove any
barriers to utilities contracting forward.  This should put EPMI on a level
footing to compete to manage the UDCs price risk with other people in the
industry.
Government Affairs met today in SF to discuss our goals for the upcoming
Legislative session (which promises to be very interesting).  Competitive
default supply is on the agenda, but I would put it behind utility forward
contracting on the list of priorities.
