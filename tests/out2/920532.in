Sheri Thomas (x36557), one of my direct reports, has responsibility for the
call center that supports EnronOnline.   There is also a call center for
Clickpaper.com.  Sheri will know the name of the person who is heading that
effort as well.  I am sure that it would be interesting to compare notes on
their efforts and yours.

Welcome to Enron.  It was nice to meet you last week.  --Sally
