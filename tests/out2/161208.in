Please explain the deletion of the provision precluding sharing of the
confidential information between Enron Comm and other Enron entities.  As
ISO indicated to you this is a key regulatory concern of theirs, and I do
not want to forward this until I understand Enron's position.

I believe that ISO will only accept California or New York law for their
agreements, but will check when I hear back from you.
