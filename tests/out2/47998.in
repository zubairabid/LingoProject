Greetings -

We have scheduled a meeting with the ISO Dispatchers in Sacramento on the
evening of November 16th.   This will require travel at noon on the 16th and
an overnight stay that night.    We will fly back on the 17th.  This meeting
is designed to get to personally know some of their staff and understand what
their job entails.   There will be a team building exercise and a brief
presentation on forward trading.

I have modified the schedule to handle this meeting,  as I plan on having
five Real Timers attend.    I have selected attendees based upon , first of
all,  the existing work schedule.    I have also  taken into consideration
whether an employee has recently attended offsites or will be attending
training soon.
In other words,  I am trying to get everyone a chance to travel.

This is short notice,  so I need to be contacted by anyone that either cannot
travel or cannot accomodate the changes in the work schedule.  (You should
have a creative reason why).
Most of the modifications I propose should be favorable to those affected, in
my opinion.    Let me know if you feel otherwise.

Stewart Rosman and Deborah will be making travel arrangements for our
group.

I can be reached by cell phone 503-701-6728,  as I will be in E-tag training
class.    Dont forget that tags are coming to Real Time!!!!

Please see the attached workschedule:


Thanks!!!
