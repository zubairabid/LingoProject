I offer the following in response to Mr. Baird's comments:
1. All D&O policies are written on a "claims made basis".    As noted in my
earlier comments, I find no "retroactive date" in the policy.  If i2 renews
with different   underwriters, the "retroactive date"  should remain the
same.  If renewal is with the same underwriters, the date normally stays the
same.  If they decide not to renew for whatever reason, they should, at a
minimum, provide a runoff period or "tail" for the reporting of claims as a
result of wrongful acts committed while the coverage was in effect.  I will
leave the "contractual commitment to renew" to Mr. Lay and his attorneys.
2. As mentioned in my voice mail, the carriers are acceptable security.  We
were not provided enough information on i2 to comment on the adequacy of the
limit.  (We did note that Enron's program could apply as excess insurance if
Mr. Lay is serving at the request of Enron.)
3. The indemnity provided by an organisation to their D's and O's is normally
found in the Company by-laws.  If sued, the director or officer would first
seek protection from the Company's indemnity.  If the indemnity does not
respond, the claim is made directly against the insurance subject to the
policy terms and conditions.  Most D&O matters are covered by the company's
indemnity and the claim is subject to the deductible under the Corporate
reimbursement section of the  D&O policy.  Normally the "direct coverage" has
no deductible.
4. The contractual matter should be handled by counsel.
5. It is normal in this type policy for the application to form a part of the
policy.  "Polling"  the D's and O's at renewal will at least ensure that all
claims are reported.
6. See comment #1 above.
7. Employees are covered only when they are sued along with a director or
officer, except for the  Employment Practices Coverage, where employees are
covered along with directors and officers.
Please call if you or Mr. Baird wish to discuss further.
