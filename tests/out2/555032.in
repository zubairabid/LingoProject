Title: Cuiaba- scenarios of applicable tariff - Period Feb 1- until  gas is
available for commissioning.

We will have a meeting with Furnas Feb 5 to discuss the applicable tariff
for  the period until the gas is available for commissioning. We have a
pending proposal for CCC coverage with Aneel, but it may come out as
something differently.  We will need the Aneel agreement for CCC coverage and
the Furnas agreement as well. The various scenarios are;

1) Full coverage of 465 MW in the CCC account.
Under this scenario. EPE would get the tariff Year 3 for 465 MW and the
parcel corresponding to the gas supply would be credited to the CCC cost.
Which would pay the difference.
Notice that we would not have the  480 MW after May, because we cannot
guarantee it on Diesel. To avoid a capacity penalty, we could argue FM, but
we would not be very successful. The power plant was supposed to make or Bid
amount with the back-up fuel as well . If we did not,  after proving 480 MW
on gas, we would have taken an availability impact.  For delay, in the impact
is R$400/MW/day after May 4,  2001.
As a way to avoid the penalty, we would negotiate on the basis that we would
have 465 MW available before May 4, that is 165 MW more than our obligation.
Furnas has an average  432 MWmed commitment under the Initial Contracts for
2001.

2) Coverage of only 300 MW, the rest would depend on economic dispatch.
Under this scenario, EPE would get tariff Year 2 for 300 MW and the parcel
corresponding to the gas supply would be credited to the CCC cost.  This is
less that the initial Contract; thus, Furnas will be motivated to work out an
arrangement for the additional 165 MW that we would have available on diesel,
if it less costly than the MAE clearing level.

3) No change from Aneel.
Under this scenario we would go back to the current resolution and would only
have fuel for 150 MW. Furnas is paying for the other 150 MW capacity. Whether
they want to admit it or not, they have acknowledged the FM case. [They have
ulterior motives; that is MRE coverage for the demonstrated capacity]. If we
go back to simple cycle it is unlikely that the MAE price will be higher that
R$212/MWhr during this period. Thus it would not be dispatched for system
needs.

We will be conducting simultaneous meetings a) with ONS/Aneel and b) Furnas.
Even if the staff recommends it, the Aneel Directors/Legal department may
delay the approval, or modify it.

If we do not get the Aneel approval. We will start the process to go back to
simple cycle. Laine is working on a day-to-day schedule. The idea is that we
will release a daily event notification to give Aneel an opportunity to
correct the situation before we reach the pint of no-return. Furnas still
will argue that we are not there in our Contract, and that they will buy at
the MAE and pass the cost to us.
I will argue that according to the Contract, their remedy is in Clause 15 and
Clause 17 of the Contract,  and we are not paying because FM.
