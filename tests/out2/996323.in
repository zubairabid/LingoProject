Just some shocking news about Enron's fundraising stars.  Would you believe
this?

Dan Lyons -  $8810
He's not too far from doubling what he raised last year, and he has three
weeks to go.

Ray Sylvester - $6000

Jordan Hunter - $4500
Another huge increase over last year

I hope this is incentive for all of us to get cracking - we have a larger
goal this year - $350,000, but I know we can do it.  I know there are more
good stories out there in the pledging jungle, so shoot me a note and let me
know how you're doing.

I want to tell you about a new friend of mine.  I met her just last weekend.
She has MS, diagnosed in 1996.  She walks very slowly with a cane and needed
help negotiating her way across a thin throw rug on the floor.  When she
found out about our bike ride she pledged $500 to me and let me know how
important this activity is to her.  Research is very important, client
services to MS patients are very important - giving them hope is very
important, and that's what we do when we're out there raising money for their
future.

My new friend asked me to pass along
to each and every one of you her very grateful appreciation for all you
do.

If you have any fundraising questions, or I can help you in any way - please
give me a call at 713-646-6569.
