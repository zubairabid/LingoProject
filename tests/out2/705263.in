Larry,
I hope you have been reading the emails below related to the NCLP in which
the Bakersfield plant is located.  I think "Ed" (the EOTT lawyer) has
realized that he's not going to "buffalo me" on any of these issues and will
begin to openly share information and support my decision making on what we
might be able to do there proactively.  Some things I will be doing are: (1)
calling Randi McCormick the CWB in California who reportedly has more
knowledge about the NCLP than anyone else.  I will be setting a meeting with
her (probably at her office or wherever she keeps all of the records, maps,
etc. on the preserve), so she might brief me on the NCLP and the restrictions
that she believes EOTT is operating under with the HCP.  (2) I am placing
calls to the Nature Conservancy in California to see what they know about the
preserve (incidentally, the Steven McCormick, executive director of the
California Chapter of TNC has been named the new President of the Nature
Conservancy, succeeding the late John Sawhill).  I may give him a call and
see who he recommends that I call in California to get the inside scoop on
the North Coles Levee Preserve.  (3) I will make several other calls
gathering information.  You need to: (1) begin talking with Scott Jones and
Rick Sudderman to learn all you can from their perspective about the easement
and the preserve. (2) be available to meet with me and Randi when I get a
meeting set, (3) begin assisting my efforts to develop a proactive plan
related to EOTT's involvement in the NCLP.
