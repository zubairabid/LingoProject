If you are still trying to pull utilities and such together to approach the
California regulatory bodies, El Paso would be interested in joining the
effort.
I work with Bryan Neskora and Bruce Northcutt with El Paso Global Networks.
El
Paso is trying to install fiber along their pipeline ROW starting in Los
Angeles
through Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso, Houston.  I believe they are having
difficulties on the regulatory side.  Bryan gave me the following name in the
regulatory group:
Kim Corley
713-420-5610
Houston
Bryan said to feel free to give her a call.  Hope this helps.
I also understand we still haven't received permitting build.  Is moratorium
still in place?
