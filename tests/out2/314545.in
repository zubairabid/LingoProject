Attached is a quick pass at a template for the Midwest Energy Hub Cash
Management Policy based on conversations with both Peoples Energy and Enron
personnel.  I have tried to get down on paper all the issues and have
included several bracketed items and comments that need clarification.
However, I have undoubtedly missed some things and welcome any input. If
everyone could provide me with their comments by Thursday July 6th, I will
incorporate them and work with Kay to translate this into an executable legal
document.
Thanks for everyone's assistance,
