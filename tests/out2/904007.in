Subject: Toby & Cindy - new baby

I just received this from my friend. I don't remember who I sent the prayer
request to for the couple having a baby. I thank you for your prayers
though. It is amazing how God will be glorified through this situation.

Hey guys -

Thanks for  all the prayers for Toby and Cindy.  Cindy had the baby on
Tuesday and as of last night, Thursday, he was doing well.  He does have
anencephaly.  The back part of his skull is not formed and they don't
know how long he will live.  They are still in the hospital and will probably
remain there.  Toby and Cindy are doing really well and the baby has
touched many lives in the few days he has been here.  His name is Ian
Christian.
He weighed 5 lbs. 15 ounces and I'm not sure of the length.  I guess nurses
have been coming in wanting to see him and many have cried.  Ian's
pediatrician, which she is from India, asked Toby and Cindy about their
faith because they are doing so well.

My husband and I were talking about this last night and I can't even
imagine going through this; but what about those people that don't know
Christ as their Personal Savior.  How would they ever get through it?

I'll keep you all up to date.  Toby and Cindy told Ian that he could go
be with Jesus, but as of last night he's still here.  God must still have
some more lives for him to touch before he goes Home.

Keep them in your prayers and thanks for all the prayers, I know they
feel them.

Love to you all - Molly
