Two weeks ago I toured the Depelchin Center, one of the organizations that
receives much of its funding from the United Way.  I was surprised to find
out about the many programs that the center offers to neglected and abused
Houston children and  the caring adults who will open their homes as foster
parents.  I had already completed my electronic pledge card before going to
the center.  Learning about the important programs offered through Depelchin
and meeting four year-old Jessica and ten year-old Steven who were
temporarily housed there before going to foster homes made me very glad to
have made that pledge.

Enron has a terrific matching program that allows all employees to receive
matching funds for dollars that you may choose to give to non-profit
organizations.  Hopefully, many of you take advantage of this to stretch your
charitable giving during the year.  The United Way campaign is the one time
each year that Enron invites employees to partner with the company to make a
difference in the lives of so many in Houston.  Each dollar pledged by an
employee is matched by Enron.

If you have not yet completed your electronic pledge, please consider doing
so as soon as possible.  Our United Way campaign draws to its conclusion next
Wednesday, August 23.  I hope that each one of you will consider making a
pledge.  There is no gift that is too small, because cumulatively all Enron
employees can make a significant positive impact for Houston.  Log on to

Thanks to the many of you who have already completed your electronic
pledge.
