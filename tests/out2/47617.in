BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Weather Group
On Wednesday, December 6th, The Weather Channel aired an episode of their
show "Atmospheres," which included a fifteen minute segment focusing on
Enron's Weather Risk Management business.  Mark Tawney, Steven Vu, Gary
Taylor, and Steve Bennett were featured.  The Weather Channel has aired the
episode periodically since then.  The parts that make it through the Enron
cutting room floor will be coming soon to an elevator near you!  If you would
like to view a copy of the episode in its entirety, please contact Yvette
Simpson at ext. 3-9595.

The Weather Risk Management group completed the first ever Power Demand
transaction this week.  The transaction was a swap based on the PJM demand
index.  Power Demand contracts use average peak power demand as an index and
allow power market participants (generators, btu distributors, marketers,
etc...) to mitigate volumetric exposures.  Weekly swaps are available on
EnronOnline and the desk has placed option contracts on this index in the
broker market.  Inquiries regarding this product should be directed to
Claudio Ribeiro, product manager ext. 3-7313, Gary Taylor ext. 3-1511, or
Valter Stoiani ext. 3-6906.

West Power Trading
It,s been a wild and crazy holiday season in the West.  Electricity prices
have remained extremely bullish throughout the entire WSCC, due in large part
to below-normal temperatures, &less than stellar8 river flows in the
Northwest and Northern California, tremendously volatile natural gas prices,
and a number of generating plants down for both planned and unplanned
maintenance.  Recently, the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission (FERC) has
stepped in to implement several orders in an effort to try to correct this
&extremely flawed market.8  Stay tuned sports fans; some have the feeling
that the best is yet to come.
