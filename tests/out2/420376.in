Peter, I hate to say, but I had the same thought earlier this morning.  Is
there not one thing we can do in this country without having a lawyer in the
middle of it.  We've all lost our common sense and direction.
It sure makes for good TV, though!  I sat all last night flipping from news
station to news station getting their spin on what's going on.  I can't say
I've ever paid this much attention to a presidential election before.  I've
been telling everybody your spin on the electoral college and the 3 party
system.  That was a good thought.
