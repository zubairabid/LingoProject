The Homerun: Ken Lay,s vision and can-do attitude helped to make Enron Field
a reality for Houston.  His unsurpassed leadership brought local businesses
together to create the Sports Facility Partnership which provided the
necessary private funding to acquire the land where Enron Field is built.  It
is, therefore, appropriate that Ken throw out the first pitch on April 7.

Don,t miss your last chance to view the ball that Ken will use Friday night.
It will remain on display in the lobby through 2 PM Friday.  On October 3,
1999, Ken was presented with this ball as part of the Astros' closing
ceremonies at the Astrodrome.  To celebrate the opening of the ballpark and
mark a new era of Houston baseball, Ken will use this same ball for the
ceremonial first pitch at Enron Field.
