Latest NBA Player News

Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed right
ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games this
season. Mills does have some Fantasy value, especially in deeper leagues, so
keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the
waiver wire.

Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game against
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair torn
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy
value at this point.

Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has no
Fantasy value.

Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00
Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of
his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2
assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.

Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00
Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close to
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be happy
that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries and
will be easy prey for Wallace.

Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He is
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligible
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2
rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of
Fantasy.

James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.
"The team got together and discussed some things," said Posey, "and
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)." Reports out of Denver say
that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel
ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston
Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a
night of production from some of their Denver players.

Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right knee,
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. The
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.

Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The
shoulder's still attached to my body," said Henderson. "No question I'll
play."  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one of
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he is
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a
smart move.

Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00
Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Hawks
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where he
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth a
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.

Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00
Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, but
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluations
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.

Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00
Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will undergo
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expected
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wise
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viable
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.

Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 rebounds
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value.

Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter after
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coach
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00
In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury -
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their
lineup.

Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00
O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him to
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  He
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of his
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go by
total points.

Avery Johnson , G SA - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Johnson is suffering from a bruised left thigh and is questionable for
Monday's showdown at Utah.  Antonio Daniels will start at point guard if
Johnson is unable to play.  Even if he does play the bruise may sap him of
his speed and hinder his Fantasy production.  Bench Johnson for a while if
possible.

Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Trent has been working out and could be close to making his return soon.
Owner Mark Cuban told The Dallas Morning News that Trent will be back by Dec.
20 "at the latest".  This should not persuade Fantasy owners to pick him up.
Unless you desperately need a forward, wait and see if he remains healthy
when he returns before you pick him up.

Iakovos Tsakalidis , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Tsakalidis was placed on the injured list due to a dental problem.  When he
was drafted during the offseason Phoenix hoped that he could move into the
starting lineup.  He has played sparingly so far this season and has been a
major Fantasy bust.  If you have him on your Fantasy team it's time for you
to let him go.

Predrag Stojakovic , F SAC - Fear Updated 12/11/00
Stojakovic missed his second straight game on Sunday night with a bruised
right shoulder. He injured the shoulder in practice on Thursday and hasn't
played since. In the wake of Stojakovic's injury, Fantasy owners may want to
look elsewhere for a forward if your roster allows a solid replacement.

Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00
Wallace has been listed as day-to-day on the NBA's injury report with a
sprained right wrist. He sustained the injury during Friday night's loss to
the Sixers and missed Saturday's game against Detroit. Wallace, who is one of
the league's few solid Fantasy centers, has averaged 20.1 points per game to
lead the Blazers this season. With so few options at center, some Fantasy
owners may have to roll the dice with Wallace this week and hope he returns
to the court for Tuesday night's game at Golden State.

Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/11/00
Bryant suffered a slight sprain on his left ankle during Sunday's game
against the Pistons. The injury is not serious, and the league's leading
scorer isn't expected to miss any time. Continue starting Bryant, who has
become a real Fantasy stud, on a weekly basis.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/11/00
Hill was activated from the injured list before tonight's game against the
Los Angeles Clippers. The former Duke star has missed all but two of
Orlando's 20 games this season with an ankle injury. In his only two
appearances, Hill averaged 13.5 points, 7.5 rebounds and 6.5 assists per
game. He may need a few games to get his feet back under him, but Hill should
still produce numbers good enough to warrant a start this week.

Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Gill missed his third consecutive game on Sunday night due to tendinitis in
his right knee. He isn't expected to return to the Nets' lineup until
Saturday, when the team travels to Atlanta. Gill has been a major
disappointment to Fantasy owners early in the season, averaging only 10.5
points per game. It may be time to cut your losses and drop Gill if another
viable option is open to you.

Chucky Atkins , G DET - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Atkins suffered a bruised heel during Sunday night's game  against the
Lakers. He shot just 2-for-10 in only 20 minutes of play. The injury isn't
considered serious, and Atkins should return to practice on Tuesday. The
Pistons' point guard leads his team in assists (5.2) and is second in scoring
(12.8), and does have some value in the world of Fantasy, especially to those
owners in deeper leagues. With a three-game week, it may be better to sit
Atkins if your roster allows it.

Bimbo Coles , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
Coles will have a bone scan on Monday and will undergo arthroscopic surgery
on his inflamed left knee on Tuesday. Coles, who was placed on the injured
list on Nov. 22, was supposed to be activated for Saturday night's game
against Atlanta before his knee began bothering him again. The Cleveland
reserve has very little Fantasy value, especially on a team with Andre Miller
and Brevin Knight.

Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/11/00
Brand returned to the court on Saturday night after missing three games with
a hyperextended right knee. He scored 23 points in 33 minutes of play in
Chicago's 105-81 loss to San Antonio. Fantasy owners who possess the rights
to Brand should put him back into their starting lineup when roster changes
occur.

Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00
Coleman is set to resume practice on Monday and will have private sessions
with a personal trainer to keep his weight down. Coleman, who has been on the
injured list since Nov. 18 due to a lack of physical training, had reportedly
weighed as much as 297 pounds earlier this fall. The team is hoping to have
him back by the end of December. When Coleman does return, only time will
tell if he can regain the form that lead his team in rebounding and was
second in scoring a year ago. Use caution before picking up Coleman, who has
all the talent to become a solid Fantasy player but seems to lack the drive
and motivation to be considered a real commodity.

Roshown McLeod , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/11/00
McLeod hopes to return to the Hawks' lineup on Monday after spending over a
month on the injured list. McLeod, who had been granted a "leave" by the team
to deal with the death of his mother, avearged 9.1 points and 2.7 rebounds in
seven games this season.  He has very little Fantasy value.

Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00
The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.
