Gerald,

Here is the unprofitabilty Clause Wildhorse put in their proposed revised
San Arroyo contract to us.

3.01 Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
if, in the sole opinion of Gatherer, the continued operation of Gatherer's
Gathering systems, or any portion thereof, or the providing of Gathering
Services hereunder, becomes unprofitable or uneconomical to Gatherer, for
whatever reasons, then Gatherer shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement upon thirty (30) Days advance written notice to Shipper.
