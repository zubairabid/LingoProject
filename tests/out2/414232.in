Mark Elliott just introduced me to another charming aspect of English
culture, the Morris Men.  I've got their website bookmarked.  Y'all are a
goofy bunch.  Dancing around in strange costumes, beating each other with
switches.  It's funny, each one of you imparts different aspects of English
culture to me.  I am constantly amused!  If y'all would only cheer at
marathons...!
