SRRS Decommissioning Notification

We are one @Enron

Effective Friday December 22, 2000, you will have a new Security Request
Database:

In the past, Enron Corporate/North American users have used the Security
Resource Request System (SRRS) lotus notes database for their security
request needs including New Hire/Contractor/Temporary access and
Terminations. In response to the business reorganization, the IT Security and
Controls group is working to streamline Enron,s Security Request structure
and create one single request database for all groups to use, eRequest,
located at http://itcentral.enron.com/

Please click on the following link to retrieve the eRequest training guide:

A great deal of effort has been put into this project to eliminate any
duplicate security requests in Enron's Global Enterprise.  When you attempt
to access the SRRS through Lotus Notes on Dec. 22, you will find a link to
the new eRequest system.

If you have additional questions regarding your new security request or if
you have any problems with the eRequest system, please contact Information
Risk Management at 713.853-5536.


Thank you
