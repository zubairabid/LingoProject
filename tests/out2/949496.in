Stinson,

I am going to do the PRC review for Bob and Paulo.
If your time permits, please join me for these two meetings.

Bob:     9:00 am

Paulo: 10:00 am

I attended the PRC training, they suggested letting employees
read their review before the meeting.  So I did that.  Here are the
two files attached.
