Just an update on the status of the signing.  As of Friday, Duke supposedly
had signed their documents but wouldn't fax them over because they didn't
like the certificate that Enron Corp. provided with respect to the guaranty.
Clement Abrams,  Enron Corp.'s lawyer, spoke to Duke's lawyer this morning
and is preparing an additional certificate that should address their
concerns.  He is getting it signed and will then fax it directly to them and
give me the original for transmittal.  I'll keep you posted on how things
progress...
