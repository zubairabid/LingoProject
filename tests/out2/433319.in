The person we are dealing with is very nice, Stephen Kessler, their lawyer
out of New York.  He has been very helpful.  We just don't know how long it
will take it to get processed once it leaves our shop.  Our intention is to
fedex the ISDA out to Steve tonight.  The Enron Guaranty will take a little
more time, so at his suggestion we will follow up with that later, so we can
keep the ISDA moving.
