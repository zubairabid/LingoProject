BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

East Power Group
Enron Power Marketing, Inc. (EPMI) and Enron Wind Corporation (EWC) have
joined forces in a deal that combines the expertise of both Enron
subsidiaries.  EWC is developing the Indian Mesa Wind Farm in Pecos County,
TX.  EPMI has agreed to purchase 135 MW of bundled capacity, energy and
Renewable Energy Credits (&REC,s8) from the Facility for a fixed-price over a
twenty-year term.

Energy Capital Resources (ECR)
ECR has been very active in the past few months.  On December 31st, the
Brazos facility was closed to fund volumetric production payments (VPPs) off
balance sheet.  Kudos to Tim Proffit, Shirley Hudler, Teresa Bushman, Jesus
Melendrez, Chris Herron, Brian Otis, Mary Cook, Joan Quick and Nora Dobin for
their efforts in closing the first $150 million of what is expected to be a
$250 million facility.  To date, ECR has placed a total of $82 million in
three separate VPP transactions into Brazos.  The present deal pipeline for
VPP's exceeds $500 million.  Producers are interested in the VPP's because
ECR utilizes the forward price curves to determine the advance amounts,
whereas the banks use their own projections of prices.  ECR hedges commodity
price and interest rate risks at closing.  The VPP with Preston Exploration
also led to an outsourcing transaction with ENA's Upstream Products group.

IN THE NEWS

What do Enron, Compaq, Continental Airlines and JPMorgan/Chase Bank know that
the city of Houston doesn't? They know that in order to attract top talent,
they must stay competitive and current in the employment market.
Domestic-partner benefits are a reality for those companies looking up toward
the future and down at the bottom line.
Does anyone really think these companies would be offering these benefits if
they weren't cost effective and in the companies' best interests?  -- Houston
Chronicle (02/11/2001).
