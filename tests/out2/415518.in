Tana,

My name is Sandra Vu with the EnronOnline call center and I have a customer
that is calling to request execute rights for US Gas Financial Basis Swap and
US Gas Financial Swap.  The company name is Coast Energy Group, a division of
Cornerstone Propane, L.P. and the individual requesting this change is Randy
Hughes one of their Master users on EnronOnline.  He also had a question as
to why the Coast Energy Canada, Inc. has execute rights for these products
but they do not.  Randy's phone number is 403-508-6734.  I can call him back
with the information or feel free to call the customer whichever is the
easiest for you.  Thank you for assistance in this matter.
