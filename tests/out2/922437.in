Sally, FYI - We've had many complaints and I've had many discussions today
with Dave N. and Inja. They did discover some system board that is going to
be replaced tonight. Hopefully replacing the board will do it but history
makes me skeptical that this is the sole cause for the slow performance.

Needless to say we had to get Settlements and Volume Management to stop their
work and we still didn't see any improvement. I know everyone is just as
frustrated as Logistics. At our last several meetings to discuss this problem
I was insistent that unless they have an answer it seems to me, and the rest
of the staff, that the system just cannot support the real heavy demand that
first of month noms and the monthly close require.

I've included an email I received from Kathy Kelly if you want some gory
detail. To save you the trouble it normally takes 2-3 minutes to create
nominations on the largest pipes today some have taken as long as 55
minutes.

I'll keep you posted - Bob
