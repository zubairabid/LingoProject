Mark:
Steve Kean has asked if we should send EnronOnline brochures to the various
poicy makers in D.C.  As we discussed earlier, you did not want this to occur
until our electronic trading business was up and running.   Please let me
know when you think we should be able to brief policy makers, if at all.   In
any case, I'd certainly like to have some brochures on hand to be able to
answer any questions we get about the product.
An update on Blackbird and the situation regarding scrutiny of their
electronic trading product ....fortunately there was no correspondence
generated from Capitol Hill (Combest or Ewing) asking the CFTC to look more
closely at Blackbird's product or electronic trading in general.   Upon
checking with Committee folks, they were satisfied that Blackbird has been
fairly straighforward in having an open dialogue with the CFTC....Blackbird
has met with some of the Commissioners already and is meeting with Rainer
today to walk them through the product and show why its not something that
should be treated as an exchange.
Also FYI, Ewing's staff director at the subcommittee, Stacey Carey, is now
working for ISDA as a government affairs person.  This should bode fairly
positively for Ewing's awareness and position on OTC derivatives issues,
although she is precluded by ethics rules from lobbying the subcommittee or
Ewing for 1 year.
