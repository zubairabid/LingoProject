Gary,

1.  Correct
2.  Global tech drove and directed the PRC (performance review committee) for
all of it's employees.  Enron ranks all of it's employees 2 times a year.
The employees are examined and given feedback on their performance.  It is a
very lengthy process but it is very fair and insures and identifies excellent
performance.  The criteria for the rankings comes from a person's
accomplishments, characteristics and customer feedback from numerous
sources.  It is all on computer and when we discuss a persons performance and
ranking, that feedback (primarily from the business unit) is a key driver.
Plus, there are business unit reps on the PRC.
3.  I guess the way i would describe it would be that on every major
expenditure and project, the commercial people involved helped drive the
process as well as our group looking at it the same way.  An example would be
that traditionally any IT group or technologist is in love this the latest
and greatest technology.  and could look at embedding a new system in the
company because it is the latest technology and is very cool.   I would ask
what commercial function does it perform and how does it give us a
competitive advantage.  It was a very customer driven (internal and external
customers) process.  It was also a mind set and paradigm shift internally
within the group because they started looking at themselves adding to the
bottom line rather than simply a cost center.

I hope that helps.

Sincerely,
Mike
