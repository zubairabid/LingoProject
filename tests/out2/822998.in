Effective immediately, I am pleased to announce a realignment of
Administrative support for the Gas Logistics, Unify and Electronic
Commerce Groups.  We have officially hired Brandee Jackson as a new member
of our Admin Team, enabling us to provide
more hands on support across all of our groups.

That being said, our administrative support responsibilities are as
follows:

Heather Choate  Alex Saldana      Brandee Jackson
Bob Hall   Central Gas Logistics - George Smith   West Gas Logistics -
Randy Gay
Bob Superty   NorthEast Gas Logistics  - Victor LaMadrid  Texas Gas
Logistics - Pat Clynes/Daren Farmer
Kathryn Bussell  SouthEast Gas Logisitcs - Ed Terry   Electronic Commerce
- Donna Greif
Diane Cook      Unify - Donna Greif

This realignment will enable the assistants to provide more comprehensive
and responsive support for both the day to day
business needs and special projects.  Please remember that your assistant
is your primary support person!  Please utilize
her for all of your administrative needs.  This is critical to the overall
desire to provide the most effective service and cost
efficient support for the entire team.

Alex and Brandee will back each other up in their absences and will back me
up in my absence.  I will provide Alex and Brandee
support on an as needed basis.

Please call me if you have any questions about this new alignment.

Thank you,
Heather Choate, x33278
