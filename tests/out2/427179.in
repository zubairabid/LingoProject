You both may already by aware of this, but the online team has contacted me
and it is their desire to have the Japanese & Australian products also
offered out of the U.S. by Enron North America.  They would continue to be
offered by their current companies, "Enron Australia" and "EnronJapan", but
they want the products sold "24 hours a day" and I guess to do this they
would be offered also by Enron North America.  Do you see any legal issues
from your side with a your Japanese or Australia products being offered by
Enron North America too?
