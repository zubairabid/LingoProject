Steve,

I contacted Cheryl Dawson the environmental manager at Enron Methanol
regarding the Corporate Watch article.  As you can see below in Cheryl's
response the emissions reported to EPA under the Toxic Release Inventory
(TRI) rules  have decreased significantly since the 1997 report developed by
Environmental Defense.  Additionally, Cheryl related to me that Enron
Methanol was a participant in Clean Texas 200, an effort to reduce the amount
of waste being generated annually by 50% by the year 2000.  Enron Methanol
did achieve this goal, and has gone from a large quantity waste generator to
a conditionally exempt small quantity generator.  This is due to the
beneficial use by the Enron  MTBE plant of the mixed alcohol by -product from
the Methanol plant.  In 1998 , MTBE plant began using the mixed alcohols in
their process stream.  That is certainly a success story and is reflected in
the reduced n-butyl alcohol TRI entry seen in Cheryl's note below.
