We have scheduled a Project HIWAY demo for Tuesday, November 14, starting
with lunch at 11:30.  The demo will be held in room 49C3.  At this time we
will bring everyone up to date regarding the web site project of allowing
shippers and operators of HPL the ability to access their respective contract
and meter  information in a secured internet environment.  We will also
discuss plans to allow shipper nominations and operator confirmations over
the net.
If you have any questions, please call.
