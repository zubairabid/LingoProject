The first invoice for $5.4 million went out a couple of weeks ago.  CES came
back to us and said they were not going to pay.  They claimed that the total
of all of the invoices to this date that they have already paid had covered
that amount.  I have researched all of their invoices, and it looks like
there was a demand invoice in the system for the month of June for
approximately $6 million to much.  CES incorporated a credit for that invoice
in with the charge for $5.4 million, netting out to approximately $600,000.
I am meeting with CES on Thursday to see if we are in agreement.  The other
invoice for $7.5 million was sent out last week, CES is in agreement and the
payment should be here shortly.
If you have any questions don't hesitate to call me.
