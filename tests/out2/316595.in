I spoke with Don Shindler this afternoon.  He is making the changes to the
Schaffer agreement and called me to clarify a couple of points.  He said the
document will be ready to by sent out by the end of the day today.  I told
Don that tomorrow morning delivery should be fine.  I called Kevin Schaffer
and left a message on their answering machine letting them know that the
revised agreement was going to be delivered tomorrow morning.  I asked Kevin
to call  me back today if delivery tomorrow represented some form of problem.

Don will send an email copy of this revised version to myself, Rusty, and Kay
Mann.

Don:  Please include Kathleen Carnahan in this email distribution.
