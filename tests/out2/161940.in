We may want to add other issues and there may be some overlap between the PX
filing and the EOB filing.  Sorry this is so rough.

Protest of PX filing

FERC should reject the PX,s price caps because
Energy Markets are competitive in the West ) 20 loads and 40 sellers.
Say what we and EPSA said in San Diego case and say that high prices are
not due to exercise of market power, they are the product of scarcity and the
failure of the IOUs to hedge in the forward market and their underscheduling
in the PX day ahead market.
FERC had to administer the price caps for the gas industry and they caused
terrible problems ) list a few of FERC,s nightmares FERC as reminders.
The Cal PX shouldn,t be able to do this on a whim and indefinitly.
Cal PX should have to substantiate the request, which they haven,t.  ISO
and PX haven,t had the same prices as the ISO for years and they didn,t have
the problems described in the filing.  PX proposed this for political reasons.
If two parties want to agree ) why shouldn,t PX match ) they have to be
willing buyers, have the ability to go to the ISO real time market.  Parties
should be able to buy outside of the PX ) we don,t want to create a monopoly
for the bilateral market.
Recognize that the FERC may allow price caps, if they do
FERC should have same cap they allow for New York, PJM.  Inconsistent with
other markets, including Canadian markets over which Commission has no
jurisdiction.
$250 Price cap in California is not enough to incent generation to be built
because it does not allow a return on an investment in generation
FERC should consider allowing a cap based on the price at which
interruptible load is willing to be cut - $1,500.
Could we make the argument that capping the price in the PX will drive up
the price by making participants bid up to the cap?  Isn,t this what happened
in California?  Ask for Seabron to help?

Protest of the EOB filing

FERC should reject it
Cross reference anything we said with respect to the PX filing that
applies
Analysis ) provided by Seabron Adamson of why we can,t exercise market
power the way the EOB says we have.
The EOB,s filing confuses bid and price caps. After all, who would buy in
the bilateral market if they can go to the ISO and the PX get power for
less?
Attach the joint resolution telling the ISO to show cause why it should not
lower the price caps to $100/MW.  Attach the EOB vote not to reaffirm
directors. Of ISO and PX.  If in response to the EOB,s show cause order, the
ISO lowers prices to $100/MW and the PX follows suit - as they have indicated
they will in their filing and as the EOB vote on their directors would force
them - California generators will stop producing because if they generate
they will not be able to recover their variable costs.  Generators outside of
California will not sell into California markets because they would not
recover their variable costs and they could sell their power elsewhere and
recover their variable costs.  Therefore, the liquidity of the California
market will dry up and reliability problems will occur.
We &told you so8 FERC
the EOB thinks they have much more power than you allowed them to have as
illustrated by their issuing orders to show cause to the ISO to lower the
price cap and
the EOB is now making the ISO and PX unindependent by not reaffirming Board
members because they won,t vote for lower price  caps.  This is ultra vires
in that the EOB,s power is supposed to relate to retail jurisdiction, not
setting wholesale price caps (not just bid caps) for the entire California
market.
