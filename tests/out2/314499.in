Kay -FYI, this note was prepared by Peoples on what they believe to be the
open commercial issues.  I will probably sit down with them on Friday to get
their true viewpoint on the various items.  They tend to be much more open
with me outside the large group.  If only I could work this into a happy hour
we would be set.
Also, Please don't acknowledge in front of Peoples that you have received
this, although I believe this was prepared with input from their counsel.
Thanks,
