I spoke to Howard Volz at CT Corporation today, and he said he sent the
renewal to DAPSA in November (their renewal date is Feb. 1 of each year) and
hasn't heard from them.  I asked him to refax the renewal notice to them.  He
said CT will not revoke the consent for about 5-6 more weeks, so we've got
some time to resolve this.  I'll keep you posted.
