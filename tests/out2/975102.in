Soussan,
The article is interesting but I have to wonder how serious the Bain
study is. Most of the graphs of adoption rates look pretty flat to me, so I
doubt that the results have much statistical significance. They had lots of
management systems to ponder and only reported the most dramatic changes,
and the changes aren't dramatic.
Moreover, real options differs from the other management systems in one
very important respect: it is built upon an intellectually sound model that
is designed to add value to corporations. The others are based more upon pop
culture and don't have an intellectual basis.
Of course, academic integrity doesn't necessarily gain mind share or
market share for real options. There is an important network effect and the
large number of quality people working in the field has the effect of
enhancing the mind share for real options. I think we are headed in the
right direction--there is enormous interest in seminars and for consulting
work. We'd all want more, but the trend is unmistakably in favour of real
options.
Thus, I'd love to see the actual Bain study. I tried to log onto their
site, but needed a password that I don't have.
Thanks for sending it.
--cheers, Gordon
