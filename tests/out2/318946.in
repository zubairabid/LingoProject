No. 1 -- (a)  We need to clarify what "arrange" means.  For example, who is
responsible for paying for Point to Point service (which would probably be
needed in order to import/export power from Entergy or when sourcing/selling
to a non-designated resource.)  Also, there is a huge risk that PTP (or the
ability to add a network resource) will not be available at the time when
importing/exporting power is most economical.  EPMI can reserve/schedule on
behalf of Clarksdale, but will Clarksdale be paying for the extra
transmission service?
(b)  Entergy's policies allow for a day ahead designation of network
resources, if transmission is available.  However, this designation is not as
firm as the network service that  Clarksdale will be purchasing when
requesting its original network.  It seems that we can state that we will not
impact Clarksdale's original network resource designation; however, when
using an alternate designation, there is the possibility that the
transmission could be cut before the rest of firm.  We can agree to this, but
lose flexibility.  I agree that we would then need the local quick start
generation in order to meet this request (however, such plant may not be
available either.)
No. 6  Both of the above tie into this one (as well as the "profit"
calculation in No. 3) -- how is the "goal" of minimizing the resulting net
power supply costs measured?  EPMI will probably not be totally successful in
having a cost reduction 100% of the time, especially if we try to use
non-firm transmission at times because generally that imported/exported power
cost can be to their advantage.  Since the Cities will have final approval,
they may want to take some risk and use non-firm: understanding that
sometimes it won't work and the plant may have to run.  This wording also
needs to be clarified as to "arrange" -- for example, "reserve transmission
on behalf of Clarksdale"; "schedule transactions via etag on behalf of
Clarksdale."
