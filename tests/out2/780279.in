Mike, Richard, and Gary:

What I was suggesting was that we would produce the limited items that we
are proposing under the terms of the existing protective order (which are
inadequate, but we are not giving up any of the crown jewels at this point)
while conditioning our production on two points, first, that we reserve the
right to seek stronger protection in the order (a la Williams' motion) for
any subsequent materials we do agree to produce or which are compelled to be
produced, and two, that the materials we are currently producing which are
entitled to confidentiality (the trading data at a minimum) shall be subject
to the most stringent protective order which the Commission issues in this
proceeding, i.e., we get the benefit of any additional protections Williams
can secure.  I only suggest this so we can stay out of the limelight by not
being one of the "bad guy" generators who are actively taking on the
protective order, when we know that at least four generators are producing
nothing until their motion is resolved, and one marketer (Coral/Shell
Energy) has refused to produce transactional data and has objected to most
of the document request.  I have also recently learned that Calpine has
gotten an extension until Oct. 13 and will try to delay and hold off
producing much data.  I will get getting a copy of Coral's objections to the
commission shortly.
