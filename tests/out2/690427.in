TCPL intends to seek an interim 2001 Eastern Zone toll of CDN$1.1462/GJ
starting January 1/01.   This is a 13.6% increase.  They are saying to avoid
protracted litigation over interim tolls they are only seeking an increase to
reflect non-renewals and current costs, ROE, capital structure and
depreciation .  This is not what they intend to seek as a final toll which
will likely be significantly higher.

In order to ensure TCPL's position is clear, Garry Mihaichuk, TCPL Exec VP
for Operations will be attending tomorrow afternoon's briefing on their
upcoming toll application and pitch their argument to continue negotiations.

Details of their proposed interim tolls are attached.
