Thank you for agreeing to coordinate this matter with the counterparty last
week.  Upon my return from Spring Break, I received a facsimile sent March
8th from Roger Sobotkiewicz (counsel for SaskEnergy) stating their intention
in entering online transactions is that the Master Agreement with Enron
Canada dated 7/19/1995 would prevail in the event of a conflict with the
online Electronic Trading Agreement.  I am forwarding the document to you
this morning via hand delivery.
