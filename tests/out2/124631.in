Christopher,

The environmental clearance referenced is actually a clearnace from the RUS
to make sure that AEC has abided by the National Environmental Policy Act
(NEPA).

The RUS enforces NEPA for Co-op's while FERC enforces NEPA for regulated
utilities.  The NEPA clearance which is issued by the RUS is a standard
procedure inherent in any development of this type.  AEC is constructing
their new plant at an existing power plant site that is already permitted and
been in operation for many years, thus this is a positive for the clearnace.
I would expect the clearance to be granted by the RUS given AEC's past
postive development work and relationship with the RUS as well as the fact
that they are developing at an existing site.
