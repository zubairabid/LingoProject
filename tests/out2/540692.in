Thanks, Chaz, for the response.  What I am looking for in question #3
(purchase commitment) is did I convey the info correctly re:  what BMC will
accept from Enron to allow the EBS deal to close?  From notes to the Net
Works directors and Bob McAuliffe, I have copied the following statements
into the space below:

"1)  The pricing is applicable if EBS gets their deal done, and you are
willing to provide some form of commitment (at least in writing, either
e-mail or letterhead) to purchasing a BMC product in 2001...  For example, if
Randy Matson's team chose the BMC solution at the conclusion of their current
testing, they could lock in the discount at 45% by sending an e-mail (or
other form of written communication) committing to the purchase in 2001 (the
preference would be to get the "buy" done by end of 1st Qtr, if possible).
This would be sufficient commitment for BMC to go forward with their
purchases of EBS' solutions currently proposed to BMC."  Is this correct the
way I have presented it to NetWorks?  Will their replies work for you if
completed as requested above?

I didn't want to put you in a bind when I told the NetWorks teams what BMC
would feel is acceptable proof-of-commitment, nor did I want to have to go
back to the Net Works group and change the requirements.

I've got another note to send you in a minute or so, from Doug Cummins.

Thank you,
Jeff
