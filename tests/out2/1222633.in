Michelle,

Following up on our meeting last week, we need to get a Professional Services
Agreement in place with Technip USA Corp.  We do not anticipate a need for
utilizing their resources until Feb/March at the soonest, but as these
agreements sometimes take a while to negotiate, I believe it appropriate to
start this one soon.  The contact person at Technip USA is:

Gerald W. Alves, P.E.
Commercial Vice President
Technip USA Corporation
1990 Post Oak Boulevard, Suite 200
Phone: 713 548 4263
Fax: 713 548 4013
Email:  jalves@Technip.com

As discussed, we need a general type Professional Services Agreement so that
we can draw upon any of their resources at previously established rates, on
an as required basis.

Please let me know how we should proceed with getting this agreement in place,

Regards
James
