Hello Folks:
We know that you are eagerly anticipating Monday's "PRC Experience".
Enclosed is the Latest and the Greatest Agenda and Partnership List.  You
will note that the meeting does start at 7:30 in the morning -- EB46C1.  Our
goal is to enable everyone to be thawing their turkey by 3:00 that
afternoon.  If you have any questions, please contact myself or Kim Rizzi.
We looking forward to seeing you there.

Regards,
Gerry Gibson
