Just a little explanation on what you're seeing.
We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take
excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each
day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we
can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within
their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual
doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points.
