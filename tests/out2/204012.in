Devon Energy and Santa Fe Snyder completed their $2.5 billion merger
yesterday as shareholders of both companies approved the deal, which was
announced in May. The agreement called for each Santa Fe Snyder common share
to be converted into 0.22 shares of Devon common stock. Conversion requires
issuance of 40.6 million additional Devon common shares, resulting in total
shares outstanding of 127.7 million. Former Santa Fe Snyder shareholders now
own 32% of the combined company. Historical Devon shareholders own 68% of the
combined company. The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of
interests. With merger completion, Devon now ranks among the top five
U.S.-based independent oil and gas producers in terms of market
capitalization, total proved reserves and annual production. The company has
an enterprise value of $9 billion and proved reserves of 1.1 billion boe. The
company expects to realize $30 million to $35 million in annual cost savings
from the merger. Devon was added to the S&P 500 Index after the close of
business yesterday.
