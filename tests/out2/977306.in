Hi Vince,

I am resending you this request by Dr. Jacque for a paper.  They are
expecting something by Jan 22.  Should we sit down and decide on what to put
in a short paper (I think their limit was 30 pages, but that is impossible --
I think a few pages should suffice).

Regards, and happy new year,
Vasant
