I saw this on the internet & thought I'd pass it along.....

Eating fish does contribute to your intelligence, particularly before and
just after you're born.

A researcher at the University of Connecticut has found that some fish are
high in a certain chemical that's vital to brain and nerve cell growth in
fetuses and newborns.

Babies can't make enough docahexanoic -- or DHA -- a fatty acid that helps
the brain develop. They must take whatever their mothers give them, either
through the umbilical cord or by breast-feeding after they're born. And note
that baby formula isn't fortified with DHA.

Women who eat cold-water species, like salmon, trout, sardines and tuna, give
their babies a better chance at maximizing brain tissue development, the
research found. Other fish high in the chemical are herring, swordfish and
mackerel.
