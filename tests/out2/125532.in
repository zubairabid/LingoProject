Dan -

I spoke with Rich Caruso, the CFO of Ormet Corporation, last Friday and he
informed me that they had sent a Confidentiality Agreement to Enron for
execution prior to releasing their financials.

Have you seen the Ormet CA, or are we still waiting on this to arrive?  If
you HAVE received their CA, where do we stand on executing and sending it
back to them?



Thanks,

Jay Williams
