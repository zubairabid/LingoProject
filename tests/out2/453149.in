"The value of undies"

Be careful what you wear (or don't wear), when working under your
vehicle...especially in public. From the Sydney Morning Herald Australia
comes this story of a central west couple who drove their car to K-Mart
only to have their car break down in the parking lot.

The man told his wife to carry on with the shopping while he fixed the car

there in the lot. The wife returned later to see a small group of people
near the car.

On closer inspection she saw a pair of male legs protruding from under
the chassis. Although the man was in shorts, his lack of underpants turned

private parts into glaringly public ones.

Unable to stand the embarrassment she dutifully stepped forward, quickly
put her hand UP his shorts and tucked everything back into place.

On regaining her feet she looked across the hood and found herself
staring at her husband who was standing idly by.

The mechanic, however, had to have three stitches in his head.
