You should see this reply from Mike -- it is more positive than the response
from James New.  Sounds as if they have not yet finished their document on
required changes to processes, systems, commercial practices, etc. to move to
a same day calculation of their books.  Mike and I have talked about this as
a longer term goal for the London office and I knew that he was working with
James and others to come up with a plan and a timeline.  I expect to review
that with Mike when he has it in a draft form that warrants that discussion.
That is why you haven't yet seen the document.  --Sally
