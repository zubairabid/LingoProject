California Consumer Group Submits Electricity Reregulation Ballot Initiative

LOS ANGELES -- A California consumer group submitted a draft ballot
initiative to the governor and state legislature Tuesday, calling for a
publicly owned and controlled electricity system. The Foundation For
Taxpayer and Consumer Rights called for the creation of a state
power authority that would build and operate power plants, transmission and
distribution facilities.

It also advocated the oversight of electricity rates by the state Public
Utilities Commission, and the issuance of refunds to San Diego
customers who were hit with large bills this summer when they were exposed
to full market rates.

The consumer group filed papers Tuesday with the Secretary of State to
establish a campaign committee called the Campaign for the
Protection of Ratepayers, which would sponsor the 2002 ballot measure, FTCR
announced at a press conference Tuesday.

Refunds should be issued to customers of Sempra (SRE) unit San Diego Gas and
Electric Co. via a "windfall profits tax" on power
companies that sold energy at unjust and unreasonable prices, according to
the FTCR draft.

The PUC should be authorized to establish the thresholds for excessive
energy prices that would be used in determining the tax. It should
also be able to oversee the issuance of refunds, as well as electric rates
on a cost-of-service basis, the FTCR said.

At the same time, the PUC should be restructured so its commissioners are
more publicly accountable. A Citizen Utility Board should also
be created to protect consumer interests, the FTCR said.

The FTCR also advocated that a separate state agency be created that could
build, own, operate and buy power plants and transmission
and distribution assets. That agency could auction the right to build plants
to, or contract with, private generators that would sell energy to
utilities on a cost-of-service basis.

As well, the FTCR recommended giving authority to state and local
governments to take over generation, transmission and distribution
assets if necessary. No specifics were given in the draft on what would
necessitate such a takeover.

FTCR stressed that Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California
Edison and PG&E Corp. (PGE) unit Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
shouldn't be permitted to back bill customers for the unexpectedly high cost
of buying wholesale power this summer.

The two utilities have filed lawsuits against the PUC for authority to
recover those costs, as they are unable to do so while their customers
are under a state-mandated rate freeze.

"Any effort to force the ratepayers to pay even one cent more to cover the
greed and stupidity of the utility companies in this disaster of their
own making will conclude our participation in the legislative process," said
FTCR president Harvey Rosenfield.

Mr. Rosenfield questioned how the utilities could claim they are having
financial difficulties when they donated $1.2 million to lawmakers
and lobbyists in this year's third quarter, and called for a moratorium on
power company campaign contributions.

"We urge elected officials to cease accepting money from any of the
interested utility and power companies ... while the deliberations are
underway. To fail to do so will cause the public to doubt the integrity of
the legislative process," Rosenfield said.

Mr. Rosenfield also said his group would "not participate in any
behind-closed-doors legislative negotiations or discussions," saying that
the 1996 deregulation law was "the product of a three-week legislative
ramrod featuring back-room meetings, late-night hearings, payoffs
for various participants and other shenanigans."
