Nora,
I have a call into my business person.  I ran what's going on by Mark Taylor
(you know, I'm just a paralegal, Mark's a lawyer), and got his permission to
exclude the arbitration language from the agreement.  So I just wanted to run
it by Dave, and then we're home free.  Also, I don't know who you had lined
up to sign, but Louise Kitchen has strict rules that I have to have someone
from her group execute all their documents.  Who would you get to sign?
