Jim,

The message you forwarded appears to be quite appropriate for the audience of
South America employees.  I believe there may be a need for a bit more
explanation if it is necessary to respond to media inquiries.  Only if asked,
I'd suggest we respond to South American press as follows:

I can confirm that Jim Bannantine and Diomedes Christodoulou have resigned
from Enron to pursue other interests.  We wish them well in their new
endeavors.  Both had begun the transfer over to other Enron's businesses
several months ago, so the transition at Enron South America is already
underway.  We have a strong management team in place and every confidence in
their continuing ability to manage the business effectively.

In addition, for U.S. and major international media it may be necessary to
provide some further explanation.  Consequently, we would plan to use the
attached statement, only if asked, to respond to international media.  Please
let me know if you have comments on the wording in either statement.

Thanks,

John
