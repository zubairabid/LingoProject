Attached are ClickPaper approvals for November 20, 2000.  Please note that
the credit limits in the spreadsheet reflect one-tenth of the actual credit
limit that we have assigned for a given counterparty since the headroom
within ClickPaper is calculated using Sigma Factor * Volume rather than
Pprice * Volume.  We will assign all future limits by using one-tenth of the
assigned credit limit since using the Sigma factor in these calculations
generates a value of roughly one-tenth of the full limit.  Hopefully this
will eliminate some of the recent problems we've had with counterparties
busting their credit limits.  Please call or send a note if you have any
questions.  Thanks.
