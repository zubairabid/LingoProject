You forget that I have a sister-in-law with many single women friends beyond
the age of 30 who actually have attempted to change their dating luck with
this book.  I think the very fact they read/apply this book is a great
indication of why they are still unattached.  Everybody knows the fastest way
to a man's heart is through espn and college football the prerequisite being
of course the lady has the Southern charm/accent, blonde hair and preferably
blue eyes (but hazel will do in a pinch assuming everything else is there).
See, men are not that selective or demanding.
