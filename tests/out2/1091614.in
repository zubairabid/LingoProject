Here a quick summation of my morning...CANADA SUCKS!!!!  First they
rearranged their P&L file and moved the order that the traders appear and
don't bother to tell us, but here's the fun part they didn't rename the
columns.  So they had McKay's P&L reported in a  column that was titled
Lambie.  Makes perfect sense right?  Then they call me and tell me that they
need to move Disturnal's position and VAR under John Arnold, but they want to
keep his p&l in Canada.  Another fun bit of Canadian "logic."

And here my favorite.  I got an email from Kathy this morning in reply to an
email I sent her on December 8.  She told me that the p&l we reported for the
first quarter of 2000 was wrong and we need to change our numbers by 4
million to match was she thinks it should be!!!  She said that they adjusted
the DPR in the summer to move 4 million from trading to originations.   As if
that isn't bad enough, consider the fact that I've already explained to her
at least twice that she's completely high b/c I tie to the DPR for Canadian
p&l and for the originations total.

Excluding canada (I've decided they don't deserve to have their country
capitalized) my day's been good.   I'll have to fill you in on all the EMT
stories my friend told me.  They were really funny.

I'll whine more later,
Robin
