"Privileged and Confidential"

I read your message regarding the meeting with TransAlta and other Alberta
marketers with interest.  My immediate thoughts are as follows.

Obviously, you should keep the discussions entirely to problems experienced
with B.C. Hydro/Powerex foreclosure of transmission capacity.

If the project proceeds, the coalititon should appoint a limited number of
people to carry the project and report back to participants.

The working group should ensure that their proceedings include outside
counsel who had or have some knowledge of antitrust, as well as the
regulatory issues.

The coalition should stay as close as possible to government.  For example,
they should try to involve Alberta officials in the project if possible.

My guess is the Competition Bureau will take the view that regulatorys (B.C.,
NEB, FERC) have primary jurisdiction, but the Bureau may be an ally in
dealing with regulators.  Do you know who at the Bureau TransAlta talked to
about their concerns?  This may also have some bearing on the extent to which
Enron should openly participate in the project.
