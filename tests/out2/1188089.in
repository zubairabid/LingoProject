I did havea brief conversation with Janice about this but don't remember her
conclusions.  For financial transactions we are attaching the GTC's.  That is
the way we handle the regular telephone trading and in an attempt to make the
online trading look as much like telephone trading as possible we continue
the tradition.  If in current liquids trading the terms and conditions are
not sent as part of the confirm (where there is no master in place) I don't
know why we need to attach them for online trading.  If the back office needs
a Word version of the GTC to make their job easier there should be no problem
getting one for them.
