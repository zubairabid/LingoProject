Hi  Folks,

Breaking this into 2 parts  tonight so it's not such a huge email. I'll have
the Passing Game  Matchups in this one and the Rushing Game Matchups  will
follow. Good luck this week!

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.

Passing Game  Matchups. Here's how I see the matchups this  week. Please
note, see the  cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week12sheet.htm
for exactly  where I rank playersand to determine who to start. Just
because  one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily mean  I'd start the player with the best matchup. The matchup
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to deciding
between players.

Note: I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info. The Fantasy  Points Allowed by Position numbers are from
ESPN.com.



Here we go:

Locks: These games heavily favor the Offense

New Orleans  Passing Game vs Raider Defense  Gut check time for  the Saints
as they deal with life after Ricky. Most folks know I,m big on synergy
which  is just one of those $10 words for depending on your teammates.
Everyone knows that RBs need a decent  passing game to be effective on the
ground. I,m beginning to think however that the  effect isn,t quite as
pronounced in reverse. In other words, I don,t believe losing  Ricky
Williams will hurt QBJeff  Blakeas much as losing  Jeff Blake would have hurt
Ricky Williams.  With RBs Chad Morton  andJerald  Moorein the backfield,  I
look for Blake to air it out against a suspect Raider pass defense.
Basically like Donovan McNabb is doing  in Philadelphia. Over the last 4
weeks, Oakland ranks # 30 in passing yards allowed per game. For the year,
they rank # 23 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB.  WR  Joe
Hornis by far the  favored target while Keith  Pooleand  Willie  Jacksonmay
grab a  few. TE Andrew  Gloveris worth a shot  if you,re in a bind but he,s
been very  inconsistent.

Atlanta Passing  Game vs 49er Defense The 49er defense squashed Elvis
Grbac owners last week but I,m not quite ready to appoint them QB Killers.
They,ve been awful for the year up until  then. Over the last four weeks,
they rank # 29 in passing yards allowed per game. And they rank # 31 for the
year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB.  QB  Chris Chandleris
back among us  now and the cobwebs seem to be cleared.  WR  Terrance
Mathisis by far the  best receiving choice although it,s worth noting that
Shawn  Jeffersonhad a great game  against this 49er team back in week 1
(doesn,t that seem like a long time  ago?) TE Reggie  Kellycould be worth a
long shot as the 49ers rank # 22 in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing TEs
although Kelly has done very little of  late.

Minnesota Passing  Game vs Panther Defense I,m running out of  adjectives
to describe the stellar play of QB Daunte  Culpepper. And I think he,ll keep
it rolling this  week against a Carolina team that ranks # 26 in passing
yards allowed per game  over the last four weeks. Culpepper  creates some
matchup problems I  don,t think the Panthers can solve.  Of course, he,ll
be throwing to the best WR tandem in the game and that  never hurts. Both
Randy  Moss and  Cris  Carterare sure starters  in any league. Both have a
great  chance every week of exploding. I,d  even consider # 3 WR Matthew
Hatchetteif you,re in the  gambling mood in a very large league.  The TEs
aren,t much of a factor here and when they are, the receptions  are spread
around.

Washington Passing  Game vs Ram Defense Jeff  Georgegets another  start in
place of the injured Brad Johnson after a less than earth shaking
performance in week 10 vs Arizona (276 yards, 0 TD, 2 interceptions).
Fortunately, he gets to face a St. Louis  pass defense that,s still giving up
lots of yards even with Bud Carson helping  out. They rank # 23 in passing
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. And for the year, they rank
# 29 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB.  As much as the Redskins
would like to control the game with  RBStephen  Davis, you just have to
think they,ll be forced to throw in order to keep pace with the Rams. A bye
week should help things. WR Albert  Connellhas been the  source of great
frustration for many Fantasy GMs but this should be a good week  for him.
James  Thrashis covering the #  2 WR job and he might be a good roll of the
dice as well. TE Stephen  Alexanderdoesn,t seem to  produce the numbers you,
d think he would in this offense, partly because  FB Larry  Centerscatches so
many  short passes that might have gone to the TE.

Carolina  Passing Game vs Viking Defense I,m looking for a uptick from  QB
Steve Beuerleinin this one. Call it a hunch as he  does have some negatives
going his way with injuries to his supporting  cast. RB Tshimanga
Biakabutukais iffy, FB  William  Floydis out and center Frank  Garcia
(abrasion to his eye) and offensive lineman Matt Campbell (thigh  contusion)
also were injured during the New Orleans loss. Coach George Seifert is
hopeful both can  go Sunday. On the plus side, he,s  got two physical WRs in
Donald Hayes and Muhsin Muhammad that  could give the vulnerable Viking CBs
trouble. He should have more time to throw this  week against a Viking
defense that,s only recorded 7 sacks in the last 4  games. For the year,
Minnesota  ranks # 26 in passing  yards allowed per game.  The TE situation
is still shaking itself out as Kris Mangum looks to be  healthy. Only thing
for certain is  no one has really stepped in to fill the Wesley Walls  void.





Prime Matchups:  These games favor the Offense

Green  Bay Passing Game vs Colts Defense First off, this assumes  Brett
Favrecan get healthy. If he can, I like  the matchup against a Colt team
that seems to play just good enough to win. For the year, they rank # 28 in
passing  yards allowed per game. It should  be noted, they,ve played better
lately though ranking # 19 in passing yards  allowed per game over the last
four weeks.  Indy seems to jump out early and  force the other team to play
catch-up (which they often come close to  doing) Favre,s struggled with his
RBs, his WRs and his own health but this could be a game he surprises. He,s
kind of a &storybook8 guy and this  would be a great chapter in the book.
We,ll see.  RB  Ahman Greengets the start but he must get his fumbling under
control. WR  Antonio Freemanis a likely starter in your league although sort
of like Favre, he hasn,t  produced like many thought he would.  Bill
Schroedercovers the #2 WR and he often sees more passes thrown his way than
does  Freeman.  Bubba  Franksis coming on at TE and could be a nice play.

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Chief Defense Most folks know I,m not a big  Rob
Johnsonfan but he,s got a good matchup this week against a KC defense that,s
been awful  defending the pass. Over the last  four weeks, they rank # 29 in
passing yards allowed per game. For the year, they rank # 21 in Fantasy
Points allowed to the opposing QB although there,s a chance DE Eric Hicks
will  be back this week after missing time with a bad knee and that will help
the pass  rush (he didn,t practice Wednesday though) Johnson will be
throwing to one of  the game's best WRs in Eric  Moulds. Not only is Moulds
ultra talented, but  he draws by far the most targets on his team. Sharing
is great for kids but you like  for your Fantasy WRs to be ball hogs.
Peerless  Priceand Jeremy  McDanielpick up the scraps.  RB  Sammy Morrisis
hobbled so watch that as he,s a solid receiver as well. TE  Jay Reimersmahas
been a real disappointment lately although the Chiefs are awful against TEs
where they rank just # 29 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE.

Miami  Passing Game vs Jets Defense I don,t know if this will be  another
shootout like they had in their matchup earlier this season but the
potential for the Dolphins to score some points is definitely there. The
Jets rank # 25 in passing yards  allowed per game over the last four weeks.
QB  Jay Fiedlershould have plenty of options available as the Dolphins are
finally getting WRs  healthy.  Leslie  Shepherdand Oronde  Gadsdenhave been
playing well but Tony  Martinand OJ  McDuffieare now in the mix. He,s
probably  the least physical of the bunch but I,ve got a pretty good feeling
for Shepherd  here even though he may not start with Martin healthy. The
smashing success of Lamar  Smith is carrying this offense so don,t look for
too much through the  air for Miami.

Tampa  Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense QB  Shaun Kinglooks to continue the
roll against a Bear team that doesn,t know which way it,s  headed. The Bears
are decent  defending the pass ranking # 18 in passing yards allowed per game
over the last  four weeks but for the year, they rank # 30 in Fantasy Points
allowed to the  opposing QB. King,s playing with  confidence and will likely
keep focusing on getting the ball to # 19,  Keyshawn  Johnson. (something I
learned from Sporting News,  Dan Pompei this week about Johnson,s number: As
you probably know, Receivers have to  wear numbers in the 80,s. As a Jet
rookie, all the 80,s were taken so they allowed him to have # 19. It was
such a hit with the fans and NFL  Properties (cha-ching) that even when a
number in the 80,s came available, the  league granted Johnson an exception
to keep # 19. It is a cool number for a WR,  I'll admit) This week, Johnson
should continue to have success against a suspect Bear Secondary. Jacquez
Greenhas really dropped off with King,s new found attraction for Keyshawn
(wasn,t  going near &Johnson8 in that sentence) RB  Warrick Dunnis a nice
threat catching the ball and TE  Dave Mooreis a steady performer.

Philadelphia  Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense Arizona,s offense is in
shambles  with injuries all around. The  trouble is these guys weren,t very
good to start with, now they,re hurt  too. What this means is that the
Eagles could see lots of offensive action this week if the Cardinals can,t
do  anything when they have the ball.  Arizona ranks # 17 over the last four
weeks in passing yards allowed per  game. But that number will probably
worsen if QB  Donovan McNabbkeeps throwing the ball 55 times a game as he did
Sunday. Philadelphia may be struggling to find a  running game but they,re
making up for it through the air. Aeneas Williams is a tough cornerback  but
he can,t cover everyone.  Torrance  Smalland Charles  Johnsonshould see
plenty of action.  RB  Stanley Pritchettcatches the ball very well and I
keep thinking TE  Chad Lewiswill break out of his slump.

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Packer Defense Green Bay,s been pretty tough
of  late ranking # 11 in passing yards allowed per game over the last four
weeks but  for the year, they come in at # 25 in Fantasy Points allowed to
the opposing  QB. Peyton  Manning,snot a guy who,ll go wild for you in the
stat column but I like this  matchup. The Packers have a couple  of
defensive players either hobbled or out and Manning should have time to
throw. That,s dangerous. WRMarvin  Harrisondraws the majority of passes
from Manning and that,s just the way we like  it. Jerome  Pathonseems to
have taken the # 2 job away from Terrence  Wilkins. Both Marcus  Pollardand
Ken  Dilgerare solid TEs and I,d feel ok starting either in leagues that
required one. Of course, RB  Edgerrin Jamesis a huge asset catching the ball
out of the  backfield.



Even Matchups: These games  feature no real advantage either way

New  England Passing Game vs Bengal Defense The Bengals are playing harder
for  new coach Dick LeBeau but their pass defense and secondary is still
fairly  porous. Over the last four weeks,  they rank # 27 in passing yards
allowed per game. Although for the year, they rank # 14 in  Fantasy Points
allowed to the opposing QB.  This week, the health of Drew Bledsoe,s right
thumb is  on everyone,s mind. He says he,ll  play and is calling it &not an
issue8.  We,ll see. Troy Aikman  hobbled onto the field last week and lit
this Bengal team up. If Bledsoe,s healthy, he could do even  better. Terry
Glenn  and Troy Brown are the prime guys with Glenn still the  main target.
He showed an upswing  last week after a few worrisome games.  He just signed
a nice contract so let,s see if he can start earning  it. TE Eric  Bjornson
fell quickly. He  was starting a few weeks ago and now he,s unemployed. Rod
Rutledge is the new  TE and would be a great pickup if he,s available. He
caught 3 passes last week including a  TD.

Pittsburgh  Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense It,s hard to get too excited
about  Kordell  Stewartthrowing the ball but this is a decent matchup for
him. Jacksonville ranks # 21 in passing yards  allowed per game over the
last four weeks. They rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing
QB. Last  week, they let Seattle roll up the yards and Jon Kitna is hardly
Peyton  Manning. WRs Hines Ward  andCourtney Hawkinsare the new starting WR
tandem and it,ll be interesting to see if benching  st round underachiever
Plaxico  Burressmakes any difference. Truthfully,  you,re reaching if you,re
digging down for these guys though. RB  Jerome Bettisis the only viable
starter on this offense unless you,re in a really big  league.

New  York Jets Passing Game vs Dolphin Defense After the Indy loss last
week,  coach Al Groh was giving votes of confidence to Vinny  Testeverde.
That,s usually not a good sign. But remember, the last time these teams
met, Vinny went wild with 378 yards passing and 5 TDs. Miami recovered
nicely from that  meltdown and has only allowed 9 TDs in the last 4 games.
The Dolphins boast two of the best  corners in the game in Sam Madison and
Patrick Surtain. Madison can shut anyone down and  Wayne  Chrebetwill have
his hands full (although he had a great game in the first  matchup)  Dedric
Wardis the # 2 WR but I like the rookie Laveranues  Colesto do some nice
things here. Worth  a shot maybe if you,re strapped for WRs. Miami has
enough faith in  theirCBs that they often leave them on the island in man
coverage which  can lead to a big play.  TE  Anthony Bechtis showing some
nice flashes. Like  Green Bay,s Bubba Franks, it took a little while to get
these big guys  going.

Kansas  City Passing Game vs Bill Defense I,m guessing  QB  Elvis
Grbaccomes out of the chute firing. The  Chiefs desperately need this game
and it,s clear to see that Grbac winging the  football gives this team the
best chance of winning. The Bills play a solid pass defense  ranking # 13 in
passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks and  ranking # 10 in
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year. TE Tony
Gonzalezremains the focal point of the offense although the Bills rank # 4 in
the league  in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year. WRs
Derrick Alexanderand Sylvester  Morrismake a solid tandem and RB  Tony
Richardsondoes a nice job receiving out of the backfield although you never
know what  coach Gunther Cunningham will do with his RBs.

San  Diego Passing Game vs Bronco Defense Remember that the Bengals
spanked  this Denver team so anything can happen.  This time of year, I get
a fair amount of email from owners with great  rosterswho have to decide
between 2 QBs like Peyton Manning or Daunte  Culpepper. That,s great. Think
about poor Mike Riley*he,s got to  decide between Jim  Harbaughand Ryan
Leaf( Harbaugh said he,s ready to go and  is calling his injury a &mild8
hernia.  He was named the starter early in the week. But with Riley,s rock
solid  management style, he,s now starting Leaf.  I,m not sure it really
matters.  TE  Freddie Jonesis the only viable starter on that team but he,s
pretty darn good ranking # 2 in  my TD / Performance league over the last
three weeks. Denver ranks just # 27 in in Fantasy  Points allowed to the
opposing TE for the year so he could do some damage  here. Both QBs will
throw to him so  it really doesn,t matter who gets the nod.  WRs  Curtis
Conwayand Jeff  Grahamare too inconsistent to get excited about.

Oakland  Passing Game vs Saints Defense Both these teams took a beating
last week with the Raiders losing a heartbreaker to Denver and the Saints
losing  their star RB  Ricky Williamsto a broken ankle. The Saints have
actually been pretty weak on pass defense lately ranking # 24 in passing
yards  allowed per game. They are better  for the year where they rank # 7
in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  QB. It,ll be interesting. QB
Rich Gannon will  be scrambling and improvising as usual.  WR  Tim Brownis
the primary target but James  Jettand Andre  Risonwill see some action as
well. He,s  up and down but TE  Ricky Dudleymight have a chance as New
Orleans ranks # 18 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing TE for the
year.  RB  Tyrone Wheatleyis looking very questionable for this week with
two sprained ankles which will  probably force Gannon to throw more.

St.  Louis Passing Game vs Redskin Defense We see it every year it  seems
yet so many teams fail to heed the wisdom of acquiring a solid backup  QB.
Both real NFL teams and Fantasy  teams need one to be successful.  Kurt
Warner is getting antsy on the sidelines so you know QB  Trent  Greenwants to
shine for another game or two before turning the keys to the car back  over.
Make no mistake, Green wants  to win for the Rams but he knows he,s playing
for a contract. Green will be a starter somewhere in  2001 and with every
TD, his negotiating power is strengthened. He should fare well even though
Washington is a tough defense.  Partly due to the loss of RB  Marshall
Faulkwhere Green will likely be forced to the air often (as if he needs a
reason to  pass() Faulk made a bit of noise  about returning for this game
and he did practice some Thursday. Even if he does play, it,s hard to
envision him as a real factor. The trouble with St. Louis is picking the WRs
that will score each week.  Isaac  Bruceand Torry  Holtare the two best
choices but Az-Zahir  Hakimand Ricky  Proehlare not bad options either. And
just for good measure, TE  Roland Williamshas been effective.  Washington,s
secondary featuring Deion Sanders, Champ Bailey and Darrell  Green are a
superb unit but they,ll have their hands full with St.  Louis.

Baltimore  Passing Game vs Cowboy Defense Dallas shut down the Bengal
passing game last week. Now that,s  something to be proud of( This  week,
they,ll face a rejuvenated Baltimore passing game that,s flying high. QB
Trent Dilferis doing a great 1999 Tony Banks impression as coach Brian
Billick breathes life  into another troubled career. His  primary target is
TE  Shannon Sharpeand I don,t think that will change for this week. Dallas
only ranks # 21 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing TE so he could
blow up. For opposing QBs, Dallas ranks # 13 in  Fantasy Points allowed per
game for the year. WRs  Qadry Ismailand Patrick  Johnsonare decent plays as
well against a secondary that will be without  Cheatsheets.net honorary
captain / enforcer George Teague who,s gone for the  year. That will be a
factor as Teague's a leader on the field.Still though, as poor as the Cowboy
run  defense has been, you,d have to think the Ravens will focus on running
the ball  with Jamal  Lewis.



Downside Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Chicago Passing  Game vs Buccaneer Defense  Let,s put it this  way: Tampa
Bay held the Packers to  205 yards passing last week.  Shane Matthews  will
start for the  Bears. I,ve seen Shane Matthews  play and he,s no Brett
Favre. He,s  not even a Matt Hasselbeck. The  Bears are in shambles losing
another gameto Buffalo and losing another  starting QB to injury. Offensive
Coordinator Gary Crowton is rumored to be headed to Brigham Young and many
fans  aren,t sad to see him talk about going.  In fact, some wish he,d stop
talking about and just go already( This could get ugly for Matthews.
Although, it should be noted, the Bucs  have a tougher reputation than their
numbers would support. Over the last four weeks, they rank just  # 15 in
passing yards allowed per game.  They rank # 11 in in Fantasy Points allowed
to the opposing QB for  year. Solid numbers but not quite  as dominating as
Warren Sapp would have you believe. Still though, I,d shy away from most
all  the Bears this week. I,d maybe roll  the dice on Marcus  Robinsonif you
needed a  WR but it,s sketchy at best. In  fact, Matthews seemed to lock in
on Eddie  Kennisonlast week instead  of Robinson when he was thrust into
action. Whether this is a real tendency remains  to be seen but I,d be
hesitant to bank on any of these guys too heavily this  week.

Detroit Passing  Game vs Giant Defense I have never liked  Charlie  Batch.
I think it stems from the fact he looks  like Otis Sistrunk but bottom line
is I,ve never been comfortable with the  guy. I,m getting less comfortable
with each week it seems. Sunday,  Batch faces a tough Giants defense that
has CB Jason Sehorn back. They rank # 10 over the past four weeks  in
passing yards allowed per game.  Sehorn and CB Dave Thomas are both big
players who give up very little  physically to WRs Johnnie Morton  andHerman
Moore. Moore seems to be finally waking  up. He,ll likely face Thomas who,
s  not nearly as good as Sehorn.  TE  David Sloanhas a shot as the  Giants
rank # 26 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year but  keep
an eye on him as he,s questionable (hamstring /  back).

New York Giant  Passing Game vs Lion Defense Detroit may be struggling to
throw  the ball but they,re doing a pretty good job defending the pass. They
rank # 8 in passing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.  I
like QB Kerry  Collinsbut he,ll need  some healthy receivers to do anything.
Ike  Hilliardis good to go but  both Amani  Toomerand  Joe  Jureviciuswere
talking  gibberish on the sidelines Sunday after suffering concussions. Both
seem likely to play but you have to  wonder how effective they,ll be.  The
Lions are much more vulnerable against the run so it,s conceivable  the
Giants could go with heavy doses of RBs Ron  Daynewith some  Tiki
Barbermixed in for this  one.

San Francisco  Passing Game vs Falcon Defense I,m still a huge Jeff  Garcia
backer but I,m not too high on this matchup vs the Falcons. Especially with
WR  Terrell Owenslooking less  likely to play as the week progresses.  The
good news is that Jerry Ricelooks to be ok  for Sunday. Atlanta ranks # 7
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks so they,re
solid. The secondary ranks 2nd in  the league with 15 interceptions. They,re
not as tough for the year though where  they rank # 20 in Fantasy Points
allowed to the opposing QB. Atlanta  has 10 sacks in the last 4 games so
they,re getting decent pressure on the  QB. The key as I see it will be
developing the running game with Charlie  Garner. He,s having a great year
running and  receiving the ball.



Defensive Slam Dunks: These games heavily favor the  Defense

Cleveland Passing  Game vs Titan Defense  The worst thing  that could have
happened to the Browns was for the Ravens to spoil the Titan,s  perfect
record at home last week.  I,m betting you see a fired up defense this week
that could spell doom  for QB Doug  Pedersonand the  Browns. Tennessee ranks
# 9 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year. Pederson,s
been painful to watch and it  won,t be any prettier this week.  WRs Kevin
Johnsonand  Dennis  Northcuttwill see most of  the work but I,d have a tough
time feeling very good about starting either. In fact, you can pretty much
just skip  the Cleveland team this week.

Cincinnati Passing  Game vs Patriot Defense I doubt you,re still
interested in Fantasy Football in week 12 if you have many Bengals on your
roster. Here,s all you need to  know: Scott  Mitchellvs Bill  Belichick.
Belichick may have his  faults, but he,s the master at confusing a QB. It
could get ugly. On the flip side, there,s always that  shred of hope
Mitchell returns to his 1995 form and lights it up. But I kinda doubt it(
Outside of Corey  Dillon,  WR Peter  Warrickis the only other  possible FF
starter on offense.  Warrick,s always worth a roll of the dice just for his
big play  potential.

Arizona Passing  Game vs Eagle Defense This is almost unfair. The
Cardinals are already one of the  worst teams in the league. Now they  have
to deal with: Center  Mike Gruttadauria is done for  the year. WRs David
Boston,s  hamstring is worse than it was last week (when it was bad) and
Frank  Sanders has a serious knee bruise.  RB Michael Pittman,s ribs are
killing him and Thomas Jones  has walking pneumonia. Good  grief. If
someone goes to jail and  has their wife leave them, it,ll be a Country
Western song( Unless you,re  desperate, I,d avoid all the Cardinals this week
against just about any  team. Much less the Eagles who are  playing very
good defense right now.

Jacksonville Passing Game vs Steeler  Defense The above three offenses
(Cleveland, Cincinnati and Arizona) make the &Slam Dunk8 list because the
offenses are awful. The Jags are  struggling with injuries still but they
land here because the Steelers are  playing excellent defense.  Pittsburgh
ranks # 4 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and
rank # 3 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB for the year.
Remember, it was against the Steelers when QB Mark  Brunell was benched for
Jamie Martin back in week 5. Brunell will throw to WR Jimmy Smith  and
Keenan McCardell but I,m not looking for a lot from either  guy. The game is
in Pittsburgh at  night and that,s a long ways from Jacksonville both in
miles and more  importantly, temperature. TE  Kyle Brady has calmed down
since Jimmy Smith is back healthy although he,s a  decent play against a
tough defense.

Dallas Passing Game vsRaven  Defense Troy Aikman will find the  going
tougher this week against a fired up Raven team than he did against the
Bengals last week. Baltimore  ranks # 2 for the year in Fantasy Points
allowed to the  opposing QB. Over  the last four games, they rate # 3 in
passing yards allowed per  game. Aikman will  look for James McNight and
Jason Tucker (man that sounds weird)  but don,t expect the same success you
saw last week from these guys. In case you were wondering, Baltimore is
also ranked # 3 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing TE for the year
so  Jackie Harris and David LaFluer don,t look good  either.

Tennessee Passing Game vsBrown  Defense One of the cornerstone principles
of  Fantasy Football is you have to understand that the numbers rule. It,s
easy to look at the Browns and  dismiss them as awful but in certain areas,
such as pass defense, they,re very  good in the numbers department. For  the
year, Cleveland ranks # 5 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB.
Over  the last four games, they rank # 2 in passing yards allowed per  game.
The reasons  for doing so are different but they,re putting up pass defense
numbers very  similar to what the Ravens are posting.  In Cleveland,s case,
teams are choosing to run the ball against their  vulnerable rush defense.
Why risk a  pass when the defense is begging to be run over? QB Steve McNair
will be looking  to WRs Derrick Mason and Chris Sanders. Carl Pickens and
Yancey  Thigpen could play but you,ve been burned enough by these guys
already. TE Frank Wycheck is still the  primary receiver although McNair is
spreading the ball around a little  more.
Denver  Passing Game vs Charger Defense After a few weeks of flailing
about, the Chargers are back at the top of the defensive rankings. Over the
last four weeks, they rank # 1  in passing yards allowed  per game where they
faced Miami, Seattle and Oakland. Granted, that,s not like shutting down
St. Louis but holding those teams to an average of 128 yards passing per game
is  strong. They,ll be facing new QB  Gus Frerotte who,ll likely take a bit
to get settled. WRs Ed McCaffrey and Rod  Smith are both solid. Denver,s
still using the 3 TE set with Desmond Clark, Dwayne Carswell and Byron
Chamberlain all producing. I  like all the Broncos and I can see them
starting in many leagues, I,m just not  too happy about the matchup this week.
