Mr. Hodge,

I spoke briefly with Profs  Shipman and Whaley. Of course, they always
like to hear from former  students so I've included their relevant
information. Prof. Shipman,  surprisingly, does not use e-mail, so I have
atelephone number. If  they're interested, may I provide them with
theinformation from your  business card?

Professor Douglas Whaley: dglswhaley@aol.com
Professor Morgan Shipman:
Office: (614) 292-0350
Secretary: (614) 292-0388
