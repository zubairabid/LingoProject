I spoke with Bob Mustard of Tom Brown today and we are going to get access to
the Wildhorse information on Wed. Nov. 29 at 1:00 MST in the Kinder Morgan
offices.  We will have until Christmas to agree on a value for the assets we
have an interest in acquiring.  Tom Brown plans to have a Data Room open Jan.
3-12 to sell all of their Pieceance and Uintah gathering assets.  If we have
agreed on a value for this system by Christmas then they will not include
these assets in that Data Room.  Let's discuss the particulars in the Tues
morning meeting tommorow.
