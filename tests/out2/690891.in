Hey Jim,

While I was out on vacation last week, Patrick unwound some positions that
brought Westpark onto the radar screen.  Not having my understanding or
knowledge of this relationship, the credit analyst looking at the trades
asked the market risk to run a 5-day VAR.  Excluding December, the open
position (which later was completely unwound) had positive 5-day VAR that
exceeded the collateral being held, i.e. $1.5MM.  Because Patrick did
eventually close out his position while deep in the money, their is no credit
risk on any of his business.  However, combing the volatile nature of this
price environment (prompt, gas daily being so dramatic), large volumes, and
one sided nature of trading, we are now uncomfortable with the $300M/Bcf rule.

Until the market calms a bit, what was once quoted as $300M for each Bcf
open, is now $1MM for each Bcf open.  This collateral to be posted upfront.
By increasing this multiple, we should easily be able to stay within the 99th
percentile of probable VAR.

Please communicate this strategy to Patrick and let me know if you would like
to schedule a meeting to further discuss.

thanks
