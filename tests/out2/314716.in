Sorry if I'm a little late in the day.  I feel into marathon meeting mode
today.
Here are my observations of the GE contract.  I tried to confine it to
significant issues since it appears to me that the negotiations are far along.
General Terms and Conditions
I don't see where the buyer has much financial leverage for
performance/warranty issues.  Final payment is made at shipment, with the
Buyer having the benefit of a 10% retention bond; however, the retention bond
expires at Provisional Acceptance.  There is no financial leverage for Final
Acceptance or the warranty period.  Also, usually provisional or final
acceptance requires that GE provide the operating manuals.
The assignment language (8) is somewhat narrow.  I don't know the deal, so I
don't know how it fits. It can help to have language which allows for free
assignment after provisional acceptance or payment in full, whichever occurs
first.  Also, the contract can allow for a substitute guaranty as payment
security, in lieu of the buyer guaranty.  Again, I don't know the deal so
this may be fine as is.
The contract incorporates GE's proposal as a  part of the contract, but does
not give an order of precedence.  I haven't seen the proposal or any other
technical exhibits, but sometimes these can be very self-serving.  Therefore,
you can potentially lose ground with what is in the exhibit.
Warranty.  The language is a bit confusing to me, especially the interplay of
the 1st and 2nd paragraph.  Also, the "outs" they have are very broad.  It is
better if there outs are limited to installation/operation/maintenance not in
accoredance with their written instructions (alternatively, industry
practice).  Also, they have an out if repairs are performed without their
permission, but there's no time line or urgency for their response to a
warranty claim.  A statement that they must provide a service engineer within
3 days or so might help.  I also suggest being clear that 1.2 applies to
warranty obligations, but their obligation to respond quickly to warranty
problems need to be explicit.
Excusable Delay. (15) I would delete "indirectly" from the 3rd line.
Provisional Acceptance. I don't understand the phrase "only to the extent and
proportional share".  Does this mean that GE may not be liable for the full
LD's, or that the buyer has to prove  a right to collect LD's?
Litigation. The dispute resolution (mediation then  litigation) is not
consistent with the usual arbitration route we request.
I didn't take a hard look at LD's, since I assumed these are settled.
13.6 Enron typically gets more precise language than this.  For instance, I
would delete or clarify the phrase "including that due to environment or
operation", as being vague.  13.6 (i)The phrase "proper storage,
installation, operation and maintenance" should be as defined by GE's written
instructions, or at least based on industry standards. 13.6 (ii) could
conceivably allow them to drag their feet on a repair, then not allow us to
get someone else to do the work.
14.1  The last line should include the words "strict liability" after
"negligence". GE ususally gives us indemnity for any hazardous substance they
introduce.
This is a quick look.  If you need more detailed information (and you think
there's time to negotiate further), I can look at it in more detail.
