Cindy,
I have a friend that is a principal in a company called Nexstar.  The
company  is on a roll and offers an interesting product.  I have attached his
email and basic presentation but I thought it was interesting enough to bring
it up to you.  Also he is a friend and I don't want to ignore him.  Do we do
anything like this with our employees?

I would really appreciate some feedback on this.  Unless you think it is a
total waist of time, I would appreciate you and some other appropriate
members of your HR team to attend 1 intro. meeting to listen to their pitch.
I would of course attend as well if you like.  They have an impressive
customer list already.

Let me know what you think and I'll help co-ordinate the meeting.

Thanks,
Mike
