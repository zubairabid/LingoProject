One Enron(.  To support this corporate goal, Enron Net Works (both European
and Houston Information Technology) is standardizing technology across the
Enron Business Units outlined below.   Project plans for EBS, GPG, and Azurix
are still being finalized and will be communicated separately.  Our goal is
to create a computing environment with the same look and feel across all of
Enron.  Oh, and did we mention that this will make traveling to another Enron
site feel almost like you,ve never left home?   (At least when it comes to
your ability to access Enron information.) Well, we plan to accomplish this
with Project GEM!

Project GEM (Global Enron Migration) is a collaborative project team
comprised of IT employees from London and Houston that have focused on
delivering a standardized rollout of Windows 2000.  We want to thank our
customers who have already been contacted by Project GEM for their
participation and feedback.  Currently we have approximately 600 employees
using Windows 2000 and we are ready to begin an Enron-wide roll out.

We are finalizing our Business Unit rollout schedule.  Additional information
will be provided as it becomes available.  In the meantime, please contact
your Business Unit representative listed below if you have any questions.
