Gerald,
Wanted to keep you in the loop on where Hanover would like to see things
going with our contract.  They've been complaining almost from day 1 and
their format is getting a little more formal and aggressive as seen in the
attached spreadsheet and memo.  The attached memo in my opinion violates in
several points made the spirit of the intent of the agreement as executed.
The guy that put this together (Jerry Griffith) was not a Hanover employee
when the contract was negotiated.  I believe he is being put up to this by
his management who appear to want to change some very fundamental things that
were agreed to (most of which were explicitly spelled out in the document).
No action requested of you I just wanted you to be informed. Thanks
