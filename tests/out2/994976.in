ASK THE FOOL

-- Q. What's a mock portfolio?

-- A. Mock portfolios are a great tool for people new to
investing and for those trying out new investing methods. You
simply go through all the motions of investing, stopping short
of actually plunking down your hard-earned cash. Research some
companies, decide which ones you'd buy, and then set up a
pretend portfolio, either on paper or online. (Many websites
offer online portfolio tracking -- and we're one of them.) Keep
track of details such as when you "bought" the shares and at
what price. Then track your performance, aiming to beat the
market.

-- Q. I've heard you sing the praises of the Standard & Poor's
(S&P) 500 index fund on your radio show, but I'm wondering what
other indexes are out there.

-- A. A bunch of indexes exist, with each one representing a
particular group of companies. We'll highlight just a few. The
most famous one is the Dow Jones Industrial Index, which
includes 30 flagship American giants, such as Exxon, Wal-Mart,
Merck, Coca-Cola and Microsoft. The S&P 500 also focuses on
large companies, including 500 of America's biggest and best.

The Russell 3000 Index includes 3,000 of the largest U.S.
companies based on market capitalization (current share price
multiplied by number of shares outstanding). These 3,000
constitute about 98 percent of the U.S. market. For a measure of
small-cap companies, look to the Russell 2000. It's composed of
the 2,000 smallest companies in the Russell 3000. The Wilshire
5000 is just about the broadest index of American companies. It
began with 5,000 but now contains more than 7,000.

There are many more indexes. Some are for international regions
such as Latin America or the Far East. Others address sectors
such as utilities, semiconductors, the Internet and fried
chicken. (Just kidding about the chicken.)

INVESTING BASICS - RULES FOR REVOLUTIONARIES

In order to help readers find books that offer valuable business
insights coupled with sparkling writing, we launched a monthly
book award last year, called The Jester Award. The first winner
of the Jester was Guy Kawasaki's new book, "Rules for
Revolutionaries" (HarperBusiness, $15). In it, he lays out some
bold guidelines for those who want to bring about business
revolutions. Here are a few:
http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=168095

1. "Don't worry, be crappy." Yes, you read that right. It's
Kawasaki's inimitable way of reminding us that it can take
almost forever to perfect something, and that it's often best to
release a not-quite-perfect product and then work on improving
its next generation. He illustrates this with the 1984 Macintosh
computer, which was shipped in a less-than-perfect
configuration: only 128K of RAM, no hard drive, no
documentation, and so on. Waiting to perfect the product would
have meant giving the competition an edge and losing the
confidence of software developers.

2. "Eat your own dog food." This sounds crazy, but think about
it. By using your own company's products or services, you'll
understand what the customer experience is like and you'll be
able to flag problems quickly. Forrest Mars Sr., the man who
built Mars Inc., did taste his own company's dog food
(literally), a practice that continues today at the company.
Kawasaki offers the example of Gillette, which maintains a
shaving laboratory where 300 employees per day come in unshaven
and test the company's and competitors' products. Similarly,
bicycle manufacturer Cannondale encourages its employees to
commute by Cannondale bikes, so that they can offer feedback on
products.

3. "Eat like a bird, poop like an elephant." (Really, we're not
making this stuff up!) Birds actually eat a lot -- sometimes 50
percent of their weight every day. And elephants can poop 165
pounds per day. The idea here is that you should soak up as much
information as you can find and then share it.
