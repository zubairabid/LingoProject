Steve, as Dana indicated in his response to your message, Louis Dreyfus is
maintaining that their transactions with Todoroff are totally legitimate and
binding upon EOTT.  Vinson & Elkins is of the opinion that before we assert
an argument to Louis Dreyfus regarding the validity of their contract, we
need to hear the tapes of Todoroff's conversations with Louis Dreyfus.  The
"paper" that we have (including the notes from the Louis Dreyfus contract
administrator) certainly indicates that Louis Dreyfus suspected or knew that
something was not quite right about the December 1999 transaction with
Todoroff, but it is not enough to make a very good case for challenging the
validity/enforceability of that contract.  We need more.  John DeGeeter of
Vinson & Elkins has spoken with Louis Dreyfus'  general counsel.  Louis
Dreyfus' general counsel has told John that before he will consider providing
EOTT with the tapes, he wants EOTT to set forth in writing the reason EOTT is
requesting the tapes.  Louis Dreyfus' general counsel has also indicated that
he is not sure that Louis Dreyfus taped these conversations.
Although a final decision has not been made, here's where I think we are
headed with Louis Dreyfus.  We will send their general counsel a letter next
week indicating the irregularities with this contract (e.g. the prices quoted
in the contract were far below market, and the contract administrator had
questions about Todoroff's authorization and the "legality" of the deal).
This proposed letter would then suggest that Louis Dreyfus provide us with
their tape recordings of the conversations with Todoroff in order that we can
immediately resolve our questions as to whether one of Louis Dreyfus'
employees knowingly assisted Todoroff in his scheme to defraud EOTT.  My
guess is that a letter of that nature will at least cause Louis Dreyfus'
lawyers to listen to the tapes.  If the tapes do contain incriminating
conversations, we might see a softening of their negotiating position.  If
the tapes do not contain anything incriminating, it would seem to be in Louis
Dreyfus' best interest to provide us with the tapes to support their position
that there was nothing irregular about the transaction.
