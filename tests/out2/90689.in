How crazy would that be if we had three generations of Symes in one
classroom! If I were one of the other students and I figured out there were
three siblings in my class, I might actually consider that a little bizarre,
like a circus family or something. But whatever. I'm definitely into it
though - that is, if U.O. has decided to forgive my errant freshman year
behavior that got me booted from those luxurious residance halls and re-admit
me. They're probably looking over my application right now and just pissing
themselves, "Wait a minute - that good-for-nothing druggy thinks she's going
to GRADUATE SCHOOL...HAHAHAHAHAHA..." and so on.

And by the way, I didn't mean to throw you into a fit of Catholic guilt over
the kitty thing. She's totally fine, and mom actually likes her. I think my
presence actually upsets the balance. And I think this move might be good for
her - she'll be going back to her apartment roots. The real martyr in all of
this is Big Kitty, who still looks completely baffled when Kitty hurtles
herself at him from behind doorways and such. After she does that, they
generally both walk away from each other just looking completely dissatisfied
with the whole thing - Big Kitty because he's old and demented and everything
confuses him, and Kitty because she's young and demented and everything
pisses her off. Gotta love it.

So you look like Jennifer now? Hey, don't underestimate the one-time
popularity of that haircut. Everything comes back into fashion at some point.
I will tell Brett you said hi. His wife just had her baby - they are such a
freaking cute little family it makes me depressed. Even more than I already
am from having to sit around my house all the time and listen to Amber and
Molly call their respective boyfriends "schmoopy" and swap sex stories. It's
thoroughly disgusting, and I've told them so. They just throw their heads
back and laugh with self-satisfied couple-induced mania. And there you have
my happy little family.....

Have fun on your date tonight! Just go into it like you have nothing to lose,
which you don't, and like you don't care, which you shouldn't. 'Kay?

Love ya,
