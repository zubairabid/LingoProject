Hi  Vince, Krishna & I talked to this student while were at Sycamore
Networks.  He appears to be very qualified for our EBS Analytics group.
Sycamore has a professional services team that provides consulting on network
optimization modeling, etc. They do this to push their products, etc....  One
of the professional in that group highly recommended this student. We are
currently working with the same professional at Sycamore to perform our
intial network design analysis (since the deadline was today!).   I have
arranged for the MIT student's visit to Houston along with the two Standford
students this month. I have handed over the task of arranging such visits to
Elisabeth Grant. She will arrange everything and charge our RC so that we can
allocate to John Griebling later.  Stinson and I think that is the most
effective way of doing this.

Regards,

Ravi.
