Investing Wisely in Volatile Markets
When markets turn volatile, we have a tendency to turn our heads away for
fear of facing the ugly reality.

In the age of online investing, when we have so much information about the
health of our portfolio, why don't we sell when markets turn bearish?  And
how is it that we miss opportunities that seem so clear in 20/20 hindsight?

The four following investment principles can make it easier for you to see
when the time is right for you to take action:

1. Keep your interest in the market fresh
2. Have a sell rule
3. Diversify, but don't overdo it
4. Have an accumulation plan

Kris Skrinak, co-founder of ClearStationc, explains how these four principles
are built into ClearStation's portfolio manager.1

Pre-Open Trading2-NEW!
Now you can get a head start on the trading day, just like the big
institutional investors. Here's how the E*TRADEc Pre-open Trading service
works:


Pre-open orders will be accepted from 8:00 a.m. to 9:30 a.m.  Only round-lot
limit orders on NASDAQ NMS and Small Cap stocks are allowed.

Orders are routed to the Archipelago ECN. If a match is not found during the
pre-open session, Archipelago will scan other market centers in an attempt to
fill the order.

Orders not executed during the pre-open session will remain open for the day
on Archipelago's order book from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. ET.  They will not
carry over to our after-hours trading session.

Wireless Access to Your E*TRADE Brokerage Account
Do you walk on the wireless side?  Are you ready to access your E*TRADEc
account on your Internet-enabled phone or handheld computer/PDA?

Remember, not all wireless devices are Internet-enabled.  If you own a mobile
phone, it must be equipped with a browser and activated through a
subscription to your carrier's wireless data service plan. Internet-enabled
phones often have screens that are larger than normal to display Web site
information. To make sure your phone is Internet-enabled, check with your
service provider.  Among handheld devices, E*TRADEc is accessible from the
Palm V with OmniSky and the Palm VII.

Visit the E*TRADE Wireless Center to explore demos of a browser-enabled cell
phone and an Internet-ready handheld computer/PDA; learn how to navigate the
E*TRADEc site using a wireless device; and find answers to your wireless
access FAQs.
