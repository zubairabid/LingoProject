Jonathan,

Please resend the draft confidentiality agreement for the Public Staff,
preferably by email.  I cannot locate the document here.

The LOI with Rocky Mount is still under discussion.  In a recent discussion
with one of Enron's folks the City (or their lawyer) raised the issue that
Kilpatrick Stockton had represented them in the past, and that there might be
a potential conflict.  I don't anticipate a problem, but we should discuss it
soon.

Thank you for your assistance,

Kay
