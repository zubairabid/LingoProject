The IT Contract group has been involved in reviewing documents for Trading
Edge's Bond Link online bond trading site.  George Weber, who has since moved
into another area, discussed various issues with Trading Edge early this
year.  Laine Borgman, a contract administrator in the IT Contracts group, has
become involved in the Trading Edge review during the past week.  Attached
below are Trading Edge agreements and their responses to issues raised by IT
Contracts.
The primary issues Laine and I discussed yesterday are as follows:
Jurisdiction:
Our preference is Texas, but we would accept New York.  Trading Edge's
response is unclear, although I believe they will readily agree to New York.
Indemnification (similar to issues with Buy Side Direct):
Agreement assigns no liability to 3rd parties which the agreement describes
as "providers of software".  As Trading Edge is the nominal counterparty for
all trades, this may be acceptable if the agreement held Trading Edge liable
for settling trades.  However, I do not see where section 11 addresses
Trading Edge's liability for trades.
We would also like assurances / liability regarding the accuracy of order and
trade information.
Limits of Liability:
Review language in both the Access and TIPs agreements (per Trading Edge,
they will not agree to modify the TIPs Agreement, which is dictated by a 3rd
party).
Assignment:
Trading Edge's agreement does not allow Enron to assign the agreement to
other parties.  Initially, only EnronCredit.com personnel in Houston and
possibly London would use Trading Edge's site, so this would not be an issue
initially.  Although we would prefer that the ability to assign be included,
this issue could be addressed later as needed.
Electronic Mail (#18):
We do not want to accept email communication in the event of a lawsuit.  From
the tone of their previous response, I believe they will agree to include
lawsuits in the definition of extraordinary matters, for which email will not
be employed.
Sara, how would you suggest we proceed with the Trading Edge review ?  I will
speak with Sheila Glover regarding the involvement of Credit and Risk Control
in our request to utilize Trading Edge's trading platform.
Thanks.
