Internet Tip of the Day

Don't Forget to WAV!

One of the coolest things about e-mail is the way you can attach stuff. I'm
talking pictures, Web addresses, and sound files that help you make your
point -- typically humorous. Sounds can be sent as MP3s, MIDIs and other
files, but most are sent as WAVs ("waves"), the .wav file eextension. They're
bigger and bulkier than MP3s, but they're fine for most brief sound clips,
and they're the Windows default sound file so you know your recipient will
hear it -- assuming they have sound on their PC. Most folks do these days, so
sending a digital raspberry or hallo or belch or whatever can really perk up
your communiqu,. I'm a big Simpsons fan, and there has never been a source of
brief, pithy and hilarious clips like Homer. This site has all the "Do'hs!,"
"Woo-hoos!" and "Mmmmmmmm ... s" you could desire, along with other Homerisms
and quotes and clips from other Simpsons characters. The site has other sound
clips, too -- just check out the navigation bar to the left!

issue is "carbon sinks," like forests and farmlands. The Guinness World
Reecord people launched their Web site with the world's smallest ad, mounted
on a bee's knee. Also -- Robocarp! -- Rich guy's Russian rocket ride --
Remember the Maine! -- Feathers or scales? -- NASA probe weathers solar storm
-- and "The Birth of a Virus." Click  here to read more!
