Attached are files incorporating suggested revisions for the change order to
Contract 24-LM6K-2-99 for the purchase of a generator step-up transformer for
the Pleasanton Project.
In lieu of the Exhibit A of the draft you sent out, I have substituted
Exhibit A, the GE proposal dated October 9, 2000.
I have substituted Exhibit B, GE's standard specifications for generator
step-up transformers, for the EE&CC specifications in the earlier draft. GE's
proposal is quoted on the basis of their standard GSU transformer
specification. I have this only in hard copy and have a call into GE to
verify this is the applicable standard and whether it is available in
electronic form. I will give you a copy, Dale.
The two additional documents were transmitted along with GE's proposal and I
have referenced them in Part I, Paragraph 2.
