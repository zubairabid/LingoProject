Verizon Wireless' Reauction Bids Create Buzz As Analysts Praise Carriers'
Activities in Sale

The buzz on Wall Street last week in the wake of the FCC's reauction of 422 "
C" and "F" block PCS (personal commu-nications service) licenses focused on
the aggressiveness of Verizon Wireless, the nation's largest wireless carrier.

Industry observers also talked up the prices paid for three 10- megahertz
licenses in New York City.

Verizon Wireless agreed to shell out more than $4 billion-or nearly a quarter
of the entire $16.8 billion the auction netted-for just two New York City
licenses (TR, Jan. 29).  The additional 20 MHz of spectrum will give it 45
MHz in the nation's largest market.

Alaska Native Wireless LLC, which is 39.9%-owned by AT&T Wireless Services,
Inc., won the third New York City license with a $1.4 billion bid.

Verizon Wireless topped all bidding at the sale, which ended Jan. 26,
offering more than $8.7 billion for 113 licenses covering 150 million "pops"
(potential customers).

"It is very interesting that the company with one of the strongest spectrum
positions before the auction. . .has felt the need to be so aggressive,"
Lehman Brothers, Inc., analyst John M. Bensche said in a note to investors
last week.  "We commend Verizon for its boldness in the auction, where it
garnered spectrum over almost twice as many `pops' as the next-closest
bidder."

Mr. Bensche noted that Verizon Wireless and its founding companies "had been
quite conservative in their acquisition philosophy. . .This prior
conservatism makes the aggressive bidding all the more remarkable, and we
wonder how much of the `new' philosophy was transplanted into the venture by
Vodafone, the world leader in spectrum bullishness."

Verizon Wireless is a joint venture of Verizon Communications, Inc., and
Vodafone AirTouch plc.

"Verizon, with its voracious appetite, was the clear upset victor," said
Michael I. Rollins, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, Inc.  He had
predicted before the auction that the carrier would bid $3 billion to $5
billion on licenses.

"Although we understand that spectrum is an attractive resource, we were a
bit surprised at how aggressive the company was relative to others in the
auctions," Cynthia M. Motz, an analyst for Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.,
agreed in a note to investors.  She had expected Verizon Wireless to bid less
than $1.3 billion in the reauction.

"Based on their auction wins, we believe Verizon is unlikely to be an avid
participant in subsequent auctions," including the 700 megahertz band sale,
Ms. Motz added.

The FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau last week postponed the 700 MHz
band auction from March 6 to Sept. 12 (see separate story).

Verizon Wireless officials have declined to comment on the reauction results,
citing the FCC's anti-collusion rules.  But Dennis F. Strigl, the carrier's
president and chief executive officer, acknowledged at the Comnet Conference
& Expo in Washington last week (see separate story) that the overall prices
paid at the sale were "extremely high."

Analysts speculated why Verizon Wireless had agreed to pay so much for the
New York City spectrum.  It could be that the carrier wanted to ensure
dominance in the wireless data market, or to guarantee that competitors-such
as Cingular Wireless LLC-didn't land the valuable frequencies, they theorized.

Or perhaps Verizon Wireless is closer than analysts believe to being tapped
out regarding its available spectrum in New York, they speculated.

"The company has been quite mum about exactly why it felt the need to bulk up
so much," Mr. Bensche said.  "Of course, it will be incumbent upon management
to be much more forthcoming about their view of the revenue and EBITDA
(earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) potential
around wireless data than they have been in the past as they seek to explain
the $8.8 billion increase in the debt load."

Indeed, Credit Suisse First Boston last week downgraded Verizon
Communications' stock from a strong buy to a buy, in part because of its need
to raise cash to pay for the spectrum and the costs of building its wireless
network.  The parent company has said it will lend the wireless unit the
money to pay for the licenses.  Standard & Poor's revised its outlook on
Verizon Communications to stable from positive, citing the auction debt as
one reason.

Whatever Verizon Wireless' reasons for snatching up the New York City
spectrum, analysts concede that licenses there are valuable for any carrier.
"In order to provide nationwide coverage in the United States, New York is
mandatory," noted Knox Bricken, an analyst at the Yankee Group.

Overall, Mr. Bensche said, the C and F block reauction proceeds equate to
$4.18 per "megahertz pop," just behind third-generation (3G) auctions in the
United Kingdom ($4.29 per MHz pop) and Germany ($4.68 per MHz pop) last year,
which raised more than $80 billion (TR, May 1, and Aug. 21 and 28, 2000).
Verizon Wireless' bidding worked out to $5.79 per MHz pop, Mr. Bensche said.

"We believe that biding was rational, and that an average of $4.18/pop/MHz
was a reasonable amount for carriers to pay for the spectrum available," Mr.
Rollins said.

Analysts Scrutinize Other Strategies

Here's a look at analysts' take on how the other largest carriers did at the
auction:

AT&T WIRELESS:  It didn't win any licenses separately but will benefit from
those won by its "designated entity" (DE), or small-business, partner Alaska
Native Wireless, which bid $2.8 billion for 44 licenses.

Through that alliance, analysts note, AT&T Wireless gained spectrum in Los
Angeles and New York, bringing its holdings to 45 MHz in those markets.  It
also added licenses in other major markets.

AT&T Wireless told analysts last week that the additional spectrum would
allow it to roll out a 3G system in 16 additional markets.  In all, the
carrier says, it will be able to deploy the 3G universal mobile
telecommunications system (UMTS) technology in 88 of the top 100 markets.

In addition, Mr. Bensche noted that DE affiliates or subsidiaries of two
other carriers with close ties to AT&T Wireless-Triton PCS Holdings, Inc.,
and Dobson Communications Corp.-also won a total of 28 licenses at the
auction.

CINGULAR WIRELESS:  The carrier has 85% equity in DE Salmon PCS LLC, the
number-three bidder at the reauction with $2.3 billion in bids on 79
licenses.  Analysts say Salmon won licenses in a number of markets where
Cingular needs to fill in holes in its footprint, including Minneapolis;
Denver; Portland, Ore.; Norfolk, Va.; Pittsburgh; and Richmond, Va.

It also won licenses that could shore up Cingular's spectrum position in
other key markets, including Los Angeles, Dallas, and Boston.

But it failed to win any spectrum in New York City-a key market.  Cingular
already has a 10 MHz block of spectrum in the Big Apple, thanks to a swap of
licenses with VoiceStream Wireless Corp. announced before the auction (TR,
Nov. 6, 2000).

Mr. Bensche said Cingular "should be comfortable" with that block until it
can acquire more spectrum in New York City in the 700 MHz band auction.  He
called Cingular-backed Salmon's decision not to remain in bidding for New
York City spectrum "an act of bravery on behalf of [Cingular] shareholders."

Ms. Motz also commended Cingular for its "disciplined" bidding via Salmon.  "
While the pressure was on for Cingular to win a New York license, it was not
enough for the company to be pressured into paying more than it was willing,"
she said.

Salmon officials have said they intend to use the licenses for their own
network, although they would have the right to use Cingular's name and might
establish roaming and operations agreements with the large carrier.

VoiceStream:  A VoiceStream subsidiary, Voice-Stream PCS BTA, bid $482
million for 19 licenses.  Its DE affiliate, Cook Inlet/VS GSM V P, offered
$506 million for 22 licenses.

The companies filled important VoiceStream footprint holes in the Carolinas,
including Charlotte and Greensboro in North Carolina and Charleston and
Columbia in South Carolina, analysts said.

VoiceStream also picked up licenses in Texas, the Pacific Northwest, and the
Midwest.  Its auction success, combined with its planned merger with
Powertel, Inc., and recent spectrum swap with Cingular, has helped it build a
nationwide footprint, Mr. Bensche said.

Ms. Motz said Cingular's and VoiceStream's auction results "could suggest
that the two intend to work closely together on favorable roaming
arrangements in the near future (since each has what the other needs already
built out)."

SPRINT PCS:  SprintCom, Inc., a Sprint PCS subsidiary,  dropped out of the
reauction.  But SVC BidCo L.P., a DE that is 80%-owned by Sprint PCS, won
five licenses for $281 million.  The licenses are in areas where analysts say
Sprint PCS had only 10 MHz of spectrum-Tampa and Orlando in Florida,
Cincinnati and Dayton in Ohio, and Norfolk, Va.

Analysts note that Sprint PCS also secured additional spectrum in a swap with
AT&T Wireless announced before the auction.  They say that because it has
such a strong spectrum position (30 MHz of spectrum in the majority of its
markets), they aren't surprised it wasn't more aggressive in the sale.

NEXTEL COMMUNICATIONS, INC.:  Nextel Spectrum Acquisition Corp., a Nextel
subsidiary, dropped out of the reauction when bidding got too high, as did
Connectbid LLC, a Nextel DE bidding partner controlled by cellular industry
pioneer Craig McCaw.  Analysts were not surprised.  They said the auction did
not afford Nextel a chance to secure a full national footprint.

"The prospect of holding only 10 MHz of PCS spectrum in a handful of markets
at high prices is not an ideal remedy to Nextel's current spectrum need," Mr.
Bensche said.

"With an average of 16 MHz of spectrum in the 800 MHz band to operate its
iDEN system, it would suit Nextel more to acquire a contiguous 10 MHz on a
nationwide basis rather than a piecemeal collection of properties,"  he said.

Analysts expect Nextel to continue acquiring 800 MHz and 900 MHz band
spectrum and say it also could pursue licenses at the 700 MHz band auction.  "
Whatever the strategy, the completion of the auction puts Nextel's
competition in a much stronger position to better compete in both the voice
and data markets, leaving Nextel at a disadvantage for future services," Mr.
Bensche said.

Meanwhile last week, Dana Frix, an attorney for San Antonio-based Allegheny
Communications, Inc., told TRthat company officials still were considering
their options for contesting the auction results.

Allegheny, which dropped out of the reauction before it was over when the
prices got too high, says the DE rules permitted large carriers to
participate through "shell entities" for licenses reserved for
entrepreneurs.  Allegheny failed to persuade the U.S. Court of Appeals in
Washington to block the reauction the day before it began in December 2000
(TR, Dec. 18, 2000).

The 35 winning bidders in the reauction have until Feb. 12 to submit down
payments, the FCC said in a public notice released last week.  The bidders
also must submit their "long-form" 601 applications, as well as form 602,
which includes ownership information, by that date.  The FCC has said it
would review ownership arrangements of winning auction bidders closely before
granting licenses.

Of the 422 licenses on the block in the reauction, 170 were reserved for
qualified DEs and 252 were open to all bidders.  Mr. Bensche noted that the
liberal capitalization rules for DEs allowed large companies to jump back and
forth between bidding on "open" and "closed" licenses, using bidding credits
for the open licenses through the DEs.

"In reality, this drove up the prices in the closed blocks to the same levels
as the open licenses being chased by the designated entities," Mr. Bensche
concluded.  "In fact, analyzing all of the markets in which at the close of
the auction one of the open licenses was won by a bidder with bidding
credits, we come to the conclusion that the closed blocks went for 9% more
than the open blocks!"

Meanwhile, last week bankrupt NextWave Telecom, Inc., whose reclaimed
licenses were snatched up at the reauction, filed its reply brief with the
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington in its case against the FCC.

In its brief, NextWave repeated its argument that the cancellation of its
licenses was prohibited by the U.S. Bankruptcy Code.  Oral arguments are
scheduled for March 15 in NextWave Personal Communications, Inc., v. FCC
(case nos. 00-1402 and 1403).

U.S. Carriers See Progress in Opening Markets But Ask USTR To Keep Pressure
on Laggards

Countries around the world are making progress in complying with open-trade
agreements affecting telecom services, but much more work needs to be done,
U.S. carriers have told the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

The carriers' statements about global telecom markets had familiar themes.
They raised issues similar to those that have dominated debates on opening
U.S. service markets to competition-disputes over pricing unbundled network
elements and policies on collocating competitors' equipment in incumbents'
facilities.

USTR recently asked for comments on the effectiveness of the World Trade
Organization's basic telecom trade agreement, the telecom trade provisions of
the North American Free Trade Agreement, and other telecom trade pacts.  It
plans to complete its annual review of the agreements by March 31.

Germany

Germany was a primary target of competitors' complaints about the progress of
market-opening efforts.  The Competitive Telecommunications Association said
the market conditions for competitors had "worsened" in Germany over the last
year.

"The intermingling of interests between the German federal government and
Deutsche Telekom [AG], which the German federal government controls in
numerous overt and subtle ways, remains a serious problem," CompTel said.

CompTel objected to "exorbitant" licensing fees that require an "up-front
payment of administrative costs projected over a 30-year period."  It charged
that Deutsche Telekom had delayed delivering services to competitors'
customers and imposed onerous conditions on collocating equipment in its
central offices.

Covad Communications Group, Inc., also complained of market conditions in
Germany, specifically the rates for unbundled local loops.  It said Deutsche
Telekom had proposed charging 34 deutsche marks ($16.25) per month for a
local loop, an increase of 33%.  Deutsche Telekom's online service unit
offers ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line) service for 49 deutsche
marks ($23.42) per month.

"In order to provide a comparable ADSL retail product in a sustainable
competitive market, a new entrant would have to charge an end user 49
deutsche marks, while paying Deutsche Telekom 34 deutsche marks per month for
a loop (in addition to apportioned payments for collocation, transport, and
OSS, as well as amortizing the increased nonrecurring loop charge of 357
deutsche marks [$170.69])," Covad said.

In addition, the competitor would have to amortize its own investments in
equipment and network infrastructure, as well as salaries and marketing
costs, it said.

Mexico

As USTR decided last week to wait on pursuing a complaint against Mexico at
the World Trade Organization (see separate story), U.S. carriers continued to
raise concerns about market conditions in Mexico.

WorldCom, Inc., said Mexico "unquestionably presents the most serious and
pressing concerns."  USTR's "persistent efforts to improve competitive
conditions in Mexico have resulted in some progress," it said, but it cited
some remaining problems:

(1)  The rule that gives the incumbent, Telefonos de Mexico SA de CV
(Telmex), sole authority to negotiate accounting rates with foreign
carriers.  Competitive carriers can't offer "market-based rates" for
international calls because Telmex has resisted reducing the "huge subsidies"
it receives from U.S. carriers and customers, WorldCom said.

(2)  The Mexican regulatory agency, the Comision Federal de
Telecomunicaciones (Cofetel), has refused to implement "flexible and
cost-oriented international termination rates" as an alternative to the
current system.

(3)  Cofetel has failed to regulate Telmex as a "dominant" carrier.

(4)  Cofetel's decision-making process lacks "transparency," and Telmex's
competitors don't have adequate input into the regulatory process.

CompTel said that "despite promises of real change, no real advances have
been made" in Mexico.  Telmex, it added, is failing to meet its obligation to
provide timely, nondiscriminatory, and cost-based interconnection.

CompTel viewed the decision to cut the rate for "on-net interconnection" to
1.25 cents per minute as a "positive step."  Telmex has challenged the rate
in court.  Telmex charges carriers a "resale" tariff rate of more than 9
cents per minute to terminate traffic in cities where the competitive carrier
doesn't have a network, CompTel said.

Spain

Spain's Ministry of Science and Technology has completed an initial review of
Telefonica S.A.'s "reference interconnection offer," Covad reported.  It said
it had several concerns with the terms of the offer.

Telefonica "offers only discriminatory collocation," it said, explaining that
Telefonica requires competitors to install equipment in separate caged
collocation spaces and restricts the types of equipment that can be
installed.  Covad also complained about Telefonica's slow provisioning
intervals for unbundled loops and lack of information on the condition or
availability of loops.

United Kingdom

Although the U.K.'s Office of Telecommunications has completed a series of
proceedings to open markets, the telecom environment there is "neither
stable, predictable, nor nondiscriminatory," Covad said.

British Telecommunications plc has refused to offer cageless collocation and
has limited the central offices that new entrants can access, it said.  Covad
said other new entrants had accused British Telecom of allocating
insufficient resources to provisioning unbundled loops.

France

Covad criticized France Telecom S.A.'s "highly problematic" practice of
refusing to sign any interconnection/operations agreement with a new market
entrant that doesn't hold an "L 33.1" telecom infrastructure license
already.  But the new entrant, Covad said, needs information in the draft
local loop access agreement to formulate the business plan required by the
license application.

Covad also faulted France Telecom's "discriminatory" collocation policies,
which forbid new entrants from collocating ATM (asynchronous transfer mode)
equipment and IP (Internet protocol) routers.  France Telecom also refuses to
provision for new entrants "spare" copper pairs (those that currently aren't
in use), Covad said.

France Telecom's pricing structure for unbundled loops, collocation,
transport, and electronic bonding to operation support system (OSS) functions
"clearly puts new entrants in a price-squeeze situation when compared to the
retail prices for DSL service offered by France Telecom's ISP affiliates,"
Covad concluded.

Peru

BellSouth Corp. focused on Peru, commending USTR's role in opening the
country's telecom markets to competition.  But it expressed concern about new
regulations under consideration in Peru.

Peruvian regulators plan to reduce the interconnection rate for wireless
carriers connecting with Telefonica del Peru's wireline network, BellSouth
said.  It voiced concern that new rates would be challenged and not put into
effect.  It also complained about the regulators' decision that the new
interconnection rates wouldn't apply to fixed-to-mobile calls.

Because the amount of fixed-to-mobile traffic exceeds the amount of
mobile-to-fixed traffic, mobile carriers would be "significantly harmed" if
the changes went into effect, BellSouth said.  It said the new arrangement
was "inconsistent with Peru's WTO commitments to prevent anticompetitive
practices" because it would benefit Telefonica del Peru.

AT&T Corp. raised similar concerns about Peru.  "Continued USTR involvement
remains necessary to ensure that Telefonica, as Peru's major supplier, is
required to provide `rates for all services at all levels that are
comparable, cost-oriented, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory,'" it said.

South Africa

AT&T objected to constraints on providers of value-added network services
(VANS) in South Africa.  Telkom South Africa Ltd., the incumbent telecom
operator, "continues to deny new telecommunications facilities to AT&T and
many other VANS suppliers," AT&T said.

It said the South African regulatory agency, the Independent Communication
Authority of South Africa, had proposed to require that at least 15% of
ownership and control of a VANS license be held by "historically
disadvantaged persons."  Such a requirement would "clearly violate South
Africa's WTO commitments to provide market access and national treatment to
foreign VANS suppliers," AT&T said.

Japan

To comply with the WTO's basic telecommunications service agreement, Japan
still needs to create an independent regulatory authority, CompTel said.  It
noted that the government still owns a "significant stake" in Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corp. (NTT).

CompTel complained that NTT employees often leave to work at the Ministry of
Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) for a few years and then return to NTT.
Those employees don't recuse themselves from par-ticipating in regulatory
actions regarding NTT, it said.

CompTel said MPT "must establish a clear and detailed regulatory
environment."  MPT needs to set guidelines on cross-subsidies and tests for
predatory pricing, transparency of accounts, and misuse of customer
information, CompTel said.

MPT oversaw splitting NTT into five companies in 1999, CompTel noted.  But
MPT doesn't regulate those carriers as "dominant," despite their significant
market shares, it added.  For example, local telecom service providers NTT
East and NTT West jointly control more than 90% of the nation's lines,
CompTel said.

CompTel also raised concerns about compliance with other points in the
reference paper and a May 1998 U.S.-Japan deregulation joint statement.  The
criticisms include the following:

(1) NTT levies "excessively high interconnect charges";

(2) NTT fails to provide access to ducts, conduits, and rights-of-way; and

(3)  Japan imposes "unnecessary and burdensome licensing conditions."

Taiwan

CompTel said Taiwan hadn't met its commitments outlined in the U.S.-Taiwan
1998 Accession Protocol.It faulted Taiwan for restrictive licensing
conditions and a lack of "transparency" in the regulatory process.

"With just six months to go before the telecommunications services market is
to be opened to all new entrants, [Taiwan's wireline regulations] requiring
an extraordinary investment of $1.2 billion in the Taiwan market and a
build-out of 1 million exchange lines-150,000 of which must be installed
prior to any service offering-remain in effect," CompTel said.

USTR Delays Plea for WTO Probe Of Mexico, Keeps Options Open

The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative still may ask the World Trade
Organization to investigate Mexico's compliance with a WTO agreement to give
foreign carriers' access to its telecom market.  But first USTR wants to give
Mexico more time to address U.S. concerns before pressing its case.

USTR declined last week to ask the WTO to convene a "dispute-settlement
panel" to address claims that Mexico has failed to implement its
market-opening commitments under the WTO's basic telecom service agreement.

USTR asked the WTO in December 2000 to convene such a panel.  But Mexico
blocked the initial request, as a WTO member country has the right to do.  A
second such request cannot be blocked.

USTR didn't make a second request for a dispute-settlement panel when WTO
officials convened Feb. 1, but that does not mean USTR has "dropped" the
case, a USTR spokeswoman said.  "That is not at all the case," she said.  "We
reserve the right to move forward."

She said a second set of WTO consultations with Mexico ended Jan. 16, and
USTR is "evaluating where we stand."  Although the parties have made some
progress in addressing U.S. concerns, several areas of disagreement remain,
the spokeswoman said.  The key concern, she said, is the level of
international settlement rates on routes to Mexico.

Industry sources also warned against reading too much into USTR's decision
not to move forward immediately.  "They're just giving [Mexico] some more
time to address the situation," one source said.  "It doesn't mean they can't
[seek an investigation] a month from now" at the next meeting of the WTO's
dispute-settlement panel in Geneva.

In addition, President Bush and Mexican President Vicente Fox plan to meet
Feb. 16, and sources said telecom topics could be on the agenda.  The meeting
would be "an excellent time [for Bush] to bring these important issues up,"
another source said.  And President Fox, who took office last fall, has said
he "understands the importance of a competitive telecom marketplace," the
source said.

In addition to Mexico's high international settlement rates, U.S. industry
also is concerned about other interconnection rates in Mexico that are "well
above cost" and the fact that there is "still no meaningful regulation of
Mexico's dominant carrier," the source said.

Burns To Unveil `Tech Seven' Legislative Package; House, Senate Telecom
Panels To Add Members

With the makeup of the House and Senate telecom subcommittees beginning to
take shape, lawmakers from both panels are preparing to launch the first
major telecom and Internet-related initiatives of the 107th Congress.

Leading the way in the Senate is communications subcommittee Chairman Conrad
Burns (R., Mont.), who plans to unveil his "tech seven" package of telecom
and Internet bills this week.  Sen. Burns, who dubbed his high-tech agenda
for the last Congress the "digital dozen," will reintroduce a few holdover
bills that weren't passed, as well as some "new surprises," his spokesman
told TRlast week.

Sen. Burns' digital dozen enjoyed considerable success last in the last
Congress, as nearly half of the bills became part of new telecom laws.  Those
successes include measures to privatize the international satellite
consortium Intelsat, designate "911" as the universal emergency telephone
number, permit direct broadcast satellite TV companies to retransmit local
broadcast station signals, legalize digital signatures, and set up a rural TV
loan guarantee plan.

Almost certain to be included in this year's package are bills to expand
deployment of broadband services using low-power TV spectrum, to ease
reporting requirements for small incumbent local exchange carriers, and to
lift the caps on universal service "high-cost" support, the Burns spokesman
said.

The other "top priorities" on Sen. Burns' agenda are bills to bolster online
privacy and to curb "spamming" (sending unsolicited commercial e-mail), the
spokesman said.  Sen. Burns also may address the process by which the
Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) selects Internet
domain name suffixes.  He might do so either through legislation or through
the subcommittee's oversight capacity.

Meanwhile, Sen. Burns' subcommittee has grown by three seats since the
previous Congress.  In handing out subcommittee assignments last week,
Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee Chairman John McCain (R.,
Ariz.) gave the Democrats two extra seats on the panel and the Republicans
one more.  Both parties now have 10 members on the panel.

The new Democratic members are Barbara Boxer (Calif.) and John D. Edwards
(N.C.).  Sen. Edwards has said he would reintroduce a bill to give consumers
more control over how their telecom service providers could use their calling
records for marketing (TR,Nov. 8, 1999).

In a statement on the Senate floor last week, Sen. Edwards said, "During the
last Congress, I introduced the Telephone Call Privacy Act [S 1850] in order
to prevent phone companies from disclosing consumers' private phone records
without their permission.  I will be reintroducing this bill soon," he said.

Senate Republicans had five seats to fill on the communications
subcommittee.  The GOP picked up one seat from Sen. McCain's decision to
expand the panel and was forced to fill four more because of three election
casualties and the departure of William H. Frist (Tenn.) from the full
Commerce Committee (TR,Jan. 15).

The new Republican members on the communications subcommittee are Olympia J.
Snowe (Maine), Gordon Smith (Ore.), Peter G. Fitzgerald (Ill.), and freshmen
John Ensign (Nev.) and George Allen (Va.).

Tauzin Expands Telecom Panel

Meanwhile, efforts to organize the House telecommunications subcommittee were
held up by a dispute over whether to add seats to the full House Energy and
Commerce Committee.

Democratic leadership was pushing to add one more Democrat to the Commerce
Committee, which would narrow the balance of power on the committee to 30-26
in the Republicans' favor.  House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R., Ill.),
however, has proposed adding one more GOP and one more Democratic seat.

Final determinations on committee matters, including the jurisdiction and
membership of its subcommittees, will be made at an organizational meeting
set for Feb. 7.  "We'll be operating under the assumption that they are
adding a Democrat and a Republican" to the committee, Commerce spokesman Ken
Johnson said Friday, Feb. 2.

Despite the delay, Commerce Chairman W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.) said his
subcommittee assignments and selections for subcommittee chairmen had been
ratified by the Commerce Committee's Republican members.

Rep. Tauzin has proposed adding two more GOP seats to the telecommunications
subcommittee, which had 15 Republicans last session when it was called the
telecommunications, trade, and consumer protection subcommittee.  Assuming
committee approval for that expansion, new telecom subcommittee Republicans
will be its Chairman Fred Upton (Mich.), Michael Bilirakis (Fla.), Joe Barton
(Texas), Thomas M. Davis III (Va.), and John B. Shadegg (Ariz.).  Rep. Cliff
Stearns (R., Fla.), who was on the panel during the last Congress, will be
its vice chairman.

Commerce Committee Ranking Democrat John D. Dingell (Mich.) will wait for the
House leadership to agree on the size of the Commerce Committee before moving
to select new committee members and announcing his subcommittee assignments,
a Dingell spokeswoman said.  That could happen "early [this] week," she said.

The telecom subcommittee's first hearing of the 107th Congress is scheduled
for Feb. 8.  The hearing will focus on ICANN's recent selection of registry
operators for new top-level domains.

Powell To Lead with Review Of FCC Operational Changes

With a Republican administration in place for the first time since the
passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, GOP insiders appearing at last
week's Comnet convention in Washington said the political landscape was ripe
for overhauling the FCC.

Key congressional and FCC staffers predicted that federal policy-makers would
launch major efforts this year to (1) curb the Commission's authority to
impose "voluntary" conditions on merger applications, (2) update the agency's
traditional common carrier rules, and (3) pressure the FCC to accelerate its
decision making.

The Republican-heavy panel also saw spectrum- management issues-including the
identification of new spectrum for third-generation wireless services-topping
the Bush administration's telecom agenda.

Lauren J. (Pete) Belvin, an attorney at Wilkinson Barker & Knauer LLP, said
history proved that telecom policies inevitably would come to the forefront
of the Bush administration "whether the administration is deeply involved
with telecom or not."  Ms. Belvin is a former FCC and Senate staffer.

"Telecom [policy-making] happens," Ms. Belvin said, because "the market pipes
its tune, there's a reaction to it, and the FCC is at front and center."

Recently designated FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell's first order of business
will be to determine which of the Commission's operations are "messed up,"
said Peter Tenhula, Mr. Powell's senior legal adviser.  "We'll probably start
with initiatives that may not be regulatory or deregulatory but more
operational," Mr. Tenhula said.

During his first week as chairman, Mr. Powell received numerous complaints
about the slow pace of the FCC's decision-making process, Mr. Tenhula said.  "
Right now, 80% of the FCC's agenda is reactive instead of proactive, where it'
s responding to a petition for rulemaking or a [section] 271 application,"
Mr. Tenhula said.  "At the top of the chairman's agenda will be reforming the
operation of the Commission" and "expediting its decision making," he said.

Mr. Tenhula suggested that Chairman Powell also would reexamine whether
obtaining the authority to provide in-region interLATA (local access and
transport area) services still is an incentive to encourage the Bell
operating companies to open their local exchange markets to competition.
Under section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Bells must
satisfy a 14-point "competitive checklist" of market-opening requirements
before receiving the FCC's blessing to offer interLATA services.

"I'm sure that more [section 271 applications] are going to be filed in the
future, but whether or not [in-region interLATA service authorization] is a
yummy enough carrot anymore, I'm not sure," Mr. Tenhula said.  "At the time
of the Act, though, it sure looked yummy," he said.

A reexamination of the section 271 process couldn't come soon enough, said
Howard Waltzman, the recently named telecom counsel to the House Energy and
Commerce Committee.  Technology has "overtaken legislation," he said, "and
what has been happening in the marketplace has eviscerated many parts of the"
Act.

Policy-makers need to "reevaluate some of the core parts of the Act and
determine. . .whether or not they're hindering investment and innovation," he
said.

He predicted a groundswell of bipartisan support in the newly elected
Congress for limiting the FCC's role in reviewing merger-related license
transfers, as well as limiting its ability to impose conditions on section
271 and merger applications.

Congress will be looking at "what we can do to change the agency to make it
more efficient," Mr. Waltzman said.  "The biggest frustration with the way
the FCC implemented the telecom act under the Clinton administration was that
the processes were too slow," he said.

Asked to comment on the financial struggles of competitive local exchange
carriers (CLECs),  Mr. Waltzman said the CLECs' financial woes don't portend
an end to local exchange competition.  Cable TV providers and wireless
carriers also are deploying alternative local phone service, he noted.

Verizon's Strigl Has Spectrum Plan

In a keynote address at the Comnet conference, the head of Verizon Wireless
said that with the growth of the wireless data sector creating demand for
spectrum, federal regulators must adopt a consistent, market-based approach
to allocating frequencies.

"We need to ensure that the precious spectrum we have reaches its fullest
potential through a competitive and forward-looking policy," Verizon Wireless
Chief Executive Officer and President Dennis F. Strigl said.  "Marketplace
forces of fair and open competition should be the sole basis for awarding
spectrum, not artificial controls like caps on spectrum. . .or limitations
based on allowances or set-asides for various groups."

Regarding the wireless Internet, Mr. Strigl said that to be successful, U.S.
carriers must create "a unique Internet experience."  He added that his
company is not "replicating what is done on the desktop."

"Deep customization of both content and delivery" will drive the success of
the wireless Web, Mr. Strigl said.  Examples of this include alerts sent to
wireless devices that can notify their users when preselected stocks hit a
certain price or when schools are closed during inclement weather, he said.
Or users can access data such as weather or flight information.  Two-way text
messaging is another feature Mr. Strigl said he expected to help drive the
growth of the wireless data sector.

As for the devices themselves, he said, "we need compelling wireless
appliances."  He expects "nontraditional handsets" such as personal digital
assistants (PDAs) with voice capability to become more popular.  He stressed
the need for technical standards to promote the use of various devices.

Mr. Strigl said all major U.S. wireless carriers this year would be
aggressively forming alliances with applications providers and Internet
vendors in hopes of promoting the growth of mobile e-commerce.

He touted the potential of location-based services and vehicle-based
telematics.  However, he acknowledged the industry needs to protect
consumers' privacy when offering location-based services, and he said it must
encourage responsible driving when using telematic applications.

Tauzin Demands Report on Critical Infrastructure

House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.) is
demanding that the National Security Council provide his panel with a copy of
a 200-page critical infrastructure report that he says was required by law to
be transmitted to Congress by Jan. 15 but never arrived.

The lawmaker also is seeking further information about published reports that
former President Clinton waited until the end of his term before naming
members to the National Infrastructure Assurance Council, even though the
NIAC had been established by executive order in the summer of 1999.

"I am concerned that President Clinton waited until his last full day in
office to finally appoint the first group of members to this critical
council," Rep. Tauzin said in Jan. 25 letter to Richard Clarke, NSC national
coordinator-infrastructure protection and counterterrorism.

The executive order had called for the 30-member panel to propose and develop
new ways for the public and private sectors to cooperate on telecom and
information infrastructure issues (TR,July 19, 1999).

Rep. Tauzin has asked Mr. Clarke to turn over to the committee the names of
the last-minute NIAC appointees and to "indicate whether your office
recommended each of these individuals for a position on the NIAC and, if not,
specify the individual or entity that recommended such person."

In requesting a copy of the overdue infrastructure report, Rep. Tauzin also
questioned why the study "was, in fact, prepared but never signed by" former
President Clinton.  "Under the Defense Authorization Act of 2001, this report
was required to be transmitted to the Congress by Jan.15, 2001," he noted.

Rep. Tauzin originally had asked Mr. Clarke to provide the committee with the
information by Wednesday, Jan. 31.  But a committee spokesman said the panel
had decided to give the NSC "more leeway" in meeting that deadline "because
of transition issues" related to the change in presidential administrations.

AT&T Execs See Hope of Truce In Long Distance Price Wars

AT&T Corp. executives believe they're seeing at least a temporary cease-fire
in the long distance rate wars that have ravaged the revenue streams of
incumbent interexchange carriers (IXCs).  "Pricing still is aggressive, but
it is not setting new lows," AT&T Chairman and Chief Executive Officer C.
Michael Armstrong said Jan. 29 during a conference call with financial
analysts to discuss the company's year 2000 financial results.

Analysts warn, however, that any equilibrium in the IXC sector may be
temporary.  "Some have noted that long distance pricing has stabilized, which
recent data support," said Frank J. Governali, an analyst for Goldman, Sachs
& Co., in a report.  "But expecting long term `price stability' in long
distance in our view is not realistic."

Lower rates will spur greater demand, but demand growth won't be enough to
offset the lower rates, said Daniel P. Reingold, managing director-equity
research at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp.  The market will become more
competitive as Bell companies win approval to offer in-region interLATA
(local access and transport area) service, and new entrants like Global
Crossing Ltd. and Qwest Communications International, Inc., will continue
their incursions, Mr. Reingold said in a report.

Mr. Reingold has no rating on AT&T, but he gives WorldCom, Inc., a "hold"
rating because of its reliance on long distance revenue.  "Our concern runs
far deeper than price competition and [Bell company entry] in the voice long
distance business," he said.  "Rather, it runs to pricing in the long-haul
data-transport segment as well."

WorldCom's 2000 financial results, scheduled to be unveiled Feb. 8, are
likely to show the same weakness as those of Sprint Corp. and AT&T.  Last
week, Sprint reported a 17% decline in long distance operating income for the
fourth quarter of 2000 compared with figures for the year-ago quarter,
despite an 18% increase in long distance calling volumes.

AT&T's consumer services unit, which relies heavily on long distance revenue,
posted a 9.5% decline in year 2000 sales.  The long distance turmoil hit AT&T'
s business services unit, too.  Because of its reliance on revenue from voice
long distance services, the business unit's annual revenue increased only
3.3%, AT&T executives said.

But the price war didn't seem to hurt Verizon Communications, Inc., a
relatively new entrant in the interLATA service market.  Verizon's interLATA
service revenue increased $55 million in the fourth quarter, the company said
last week.

AT&T executives suggested that new competitors like Verizon would have more
effect on market share than on rates.  Low rates will continue to cause pain
because customers still are migrating to cheaper calling plans, but AT&T's
larger woe is the continuing loss of long distance subscribers to Bell
companies, wireless service providers, and other new rivals, executives said.

AT&T has tried to boost its sagging fortunes by offering local service.
Bundles of local and long distance service are thought to be popular with
consumers and profitable for carriers.  Verizon's success in the interLATA
service markets of New York stems largely from its dominance in that state's
local service markets.

But AT&T's efforts to compete as a local service provider are hamstrung by
the prices it must pay incumbent local exchange carriers for unbundled
network elements (UNEs), Mr. Armstrong said.  "If there is an open market, we
can compete," he said, noting that AT&T corralled 750,000 customers for its "
any distance" service in New York.  That state has one of the most open and
competitive local telephone markets in the nation, he said.

But in other states, AT&T's local-service efforts have fallen flat because of
UNE rates, Mr. Armstrong suggested.  "The way that the markets have been
opened is not operationally or economically viable," he said.  That leaves
AT&T dependent on its shrinking long distance business for revenue, and on
its cable telephony business as a way to break into local-service markets.

Verizon Wireless is rolling out its two-way text messaging service,...

Verizon Wireless is rolling out its two-way text messaging service, Mobile
Messenger, in more than 200 markets.  Subscribers with two-way text messaging-
capable phones can send and receive messages of up to 120 characters.  They
can either sign up for one of two rate plans or pay two cents for each
message received and a dime for each message sent.  One rate plan is $2.99 a
month and includes 100 free messages, while another is $7.99 a month and
includes 600 messages.  All messaging fees will be waived until April 1.

Versatel Absorbs VersaPoint, Cuts Workers, Writes Off Assets

Versatel Telecom International NV has absorbed what remains of VersaPoint-its
former joint venture with NorthPoint Communications Group, Inc.-after cutting
most of the workforce and halting many of the operations of the money-losing
business.  It said it would be writing off redundant assets.

Before NorthPoint's recent filing for bankruptcy protection (TR, Jan. 22), it
arranged sell its 50% stake in VersaPoint to Versatel for $6.5 million.  The
companies created the venture less than a year ago.

According to Versatel Chief Executive Officer Raj Raithatha, the company
remains committed to Versa-Point's strategy of deploying digital subscriber
line (DSL) service to compete against European incumbent network operators.
But VersaPoint focused on wholesale DSL markets and staked out a large
European territory that included France and the United Kingdom.

Versatel's focus is more narrow, offering retail service to business
customers in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, and northwestern Germany,
Mr. Raithatha said.

Versatel is happy to take control of VersaPoint's assets, especially its
central office (CO) collocations in the Netherlands, where "space is at a
premium," Mr. Raithatha said.  "It was particularly important that we secure
the Dutch COs."

Still, many of VersaPoint's assets are redundant or are not crucial to
Versatel's plans, he said.  Of 286 VersaPoint workers, 200 will be laid off.
About 1,000 CO collocations that were planned or operational are being
abandoned because they lie outside Versatel's territory, Mr. Raithatha said.

The VersaPoint acquisition is a mixed financial bag for Versatel, which will
have to absorb VersaPoint's projected EBITDA (earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization) loss of $9.3 million.  Versatel will
take a charge of $4.6 million to account for the layoffs and the write-off of
redundant assets.

But Versatel will be able to redeploy the $70 million it had planned to
invest this year in VersaPoint.  With that additional money, Versatel won't
have to seek additional funding for at least two years, and by then it
expects to be profitable, Mr. Raithatha said.

E.spire Mulls Reverse Split To Meet Nasdaq's Conditions

The Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel has agreed to continue listing
e.spire Communications, Inc.'s securities on the Nasdaq National Market, but
the financially struggling carrier will have to boost its stock price if it
wants to stay there past April 2.

Under conditions set by the Nasdaq panel, e.spire must demonstrate a closing
bid price of $5 per share by April 2 and maintain its closing bid price at
that level for 10 consecutive trading days.  To accomplish that, e.spire is
considering a "reverse stock split," the company said.

The company also must complete a restructuring of its bond indebtedness by
April 2, the Nasdaq panel said.  If it accomplishes both those goals, the
panel would consider listing e.spire's stock under Nasdaq's "alternative
listing standards," requiring net tangible assets of at least $4 million.

E.spire will need additional funding to survive until April.  It is due to
run out of cash this month.  A spokeswoman said e.spire was "working 24/7" to
try to secure additional capital.

Meanwhile, e.spire said the U.S. District Court in Baltimore had dismissed
with prejudice a class action lawsuit against the company and some of its
former officers and directors.  The lawsuit alleged that e.spire had used
improper accounting methods to overstate its earnings for 1999.

"Having fought and won this case, we can turn our focus fully on building
shareholder value," said George F. Schmitt, e.spire chairman and acting chief
executive officer.

Convergent To Cut Workforce, Close Offices

Convergent Communications, Inc., plans to reduce its workforce by 22% and
close five offices in an effort to reduce its monthly losses by $3 million,
the telecom systems integrator has said.  Convergent, of Englewood, Colo.,
already has eliminated 11 offices by selling its PBX and key telephone system
businesses to Inter-Tel, Inc. (TR, Jan. 8, notes).

Convergent will boost its data service sales force from 85 people to 155
people as part of its new focus on the data business, said Joseph Zell,
president and chief executive officer.

Early Talks with WRC-03 Nations Seen As Key for U.S. Success

It's important for U.S. officials to consult with other nations as they
prepare for the International Telecommunication Union's 2003 World
Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-03), FCC officials and industry
representatives agree.

"One of the best ways of achieving a tremendous amount at WRC is. . .[by]
listening to our compatriots in other countries, listening to their thoughts
as to what should be done," Commissioner Susan Ness said last week at the
opening meeting of an industry advisory committee helping the agency draft
proposals for the WRC-03.

"And to the extent that we can work with these other countries to achieve
their goals at the same time we're trying to formulate our goals, we're going
to have a much more successful and less confrontational radio conference,"
Ms. Ness added.  She noted that WRC-03 would be the fourth such conference
since she became a member of the Commission.

Donald Abelson, chief of the FCC's International Bureau, agreed that the
lesson the FCC had learned from past conferences "is the sooner we get to
talk to our foreign colleagues and coordinate with them, the better our
proposals are."

Mr. Abelson said the advisory committee would be important because it would
help the FCC develop WRC-03 proposals it can present to other federal
agencies, such as the Commerce and State departments.

Those proposals eventually would be the subject of consultations with
regulators from other countries leading up to WRC-03.

Peter A. Tenhula, senior legal adviser to Chairman Michael K. Powell, agreed
that early planning was essential for a successful WRC-03.

Full Slate of Issues

Among the issues the advisory committee wants addressed at WRC-03 are (1)
spectrum for third-generation (3G) services, also known as International
Mobile Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000); (2) terrestrial wireless
interactive multimedia services; (3) spectrum sharing in the 40 gigahertz
band; (4) aeronautical mobile-satellite services; (5) public protection and
disaster relief; (6) interregional sharing issues for broadcasting satellite
services; (7) high-frequency broadcasting service; and (8) regulatory
procedures governing satellite networks.

Much of the advisory panel's work will be done by seven informal working
groups focusing on specific issues, said Brian Fontes, chairman of the
advisory committee and vice president-federal regulation at Cingular Wireless
LLC.  Mr. Fontes is a former FCC chief of staff who led the U.S. delegation
at the 1995 WRC.  Jennifer Warren, senior director-telecom trade and
regulatory affairs at Lockheed Martin Corp., is the panel's co-chair.

Many of the issues the panel will explore are contentious, Mr. Fontes said.  "
I know full well as a member of a competitive industry that there's a lot of
competition among the U.S. industry interests and that competition will rear
its head in various debates and discussions," he added.  "There are also
differences between government and industry about how spectrum should be
used."

But after all the issues have been debated, Mr. Fontes said, it's important
to reach a consensus-and to do so in time to allow consultations with other
countries.

"We're going to have to recognize where we each come from and how we best can
work cooperatively and constructively together," he said.  "No more do we
have the luxury of waiting to the last moment to achieve the U.S.
objectives.  We must be prepared well in advance."

Julie Garcia, director of the FCC's WRC-03 preparation team, said the agency
was listening to industry feedback about how to improve its conference
planning.  "This is an ongoing process," she said.  "We will continue to look
for ways that we can take the industry's view into account."

U.S. officials who participated in WRC-2000 last year felt that they were
successful on issues such as broadcasting satellite service and IMT-2000
planning (TR, June 5, 2000).

Bureau OKs Satellite Operators For Intersatellite Communications

The FCC's International Bureau has modified the licenses of 10 operators of
geostationary orbit (GSO) satellite systems, enabling them to provide fixed
satellite services in parts of the Ka-band.  The license modifications allow
them to operate intersatellite service links (ISLs) using that spectrum.

The bureau said that it could permit the operators to provide ISL services as
a result of decisions made at the 1997 World Radiocommunication Conference
(WRC-97) and in light of the operators' studies on sharing the ISL spectrum.
WRC-97 resolved technical issues regarding GSO satellite transmissions and
assigned the 65-71 gigahertz band for ISL use by fixed satellite service
(FSS) providers.  The FCC subsequently reserved that spectrum for
nongovernment use.

The bureau granted the ISL license modifications to PanAmSat Corp., Teledesic
LLC, Loral Corp., Hughes Communications Galaxy, Inc., Astrolink International
LLC, CyberStar Licensee LLC, EchoStar Satellite Corp., and WB Holdings 1 LLC,
GE American Communications, Inc., and Motorola, Inc.  In a series of "orders
and authorizations" released Jan. 31, the bureau assigned each operator a
frequency.  In some cases it also set system build-out "milestones" that
operators must meet to retain the modified licenses.

Section 25.145(f) of the FCC's rules states that a Ka-band GSO FSS licensee
must (1) begin construction of its first satellite within one year of grant,
(2) begin construction of the remainder within two years, (3) launch at least
one satellite into each of its assigned orbit locations within five years,
and (4) launch the remainder of its satellites by the date required by the
International Telecommunication Union.

The bureau also issued a Jan. 30 order modifying VisionStar, Inc.'s license
to launch and operate a satellite system in GSO to provide FSSs.  The bureau
gave VisionStar 500 MHz of additional downlink operating frequencies for
satellite-to-user transmissions, bringing its total to 1,000 MHz.

DoJ, FBI Want Foreign Control Of DT Limited by FCC Conditions

The U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation say
they have reached an agreement with VoiceStream Wireless Corp. and Deutsche
Telekom AG that reduces the law enforcement, national security, and public
safety risks of DT's planned acquisition of VoiceStream.

In December 2000, the law enforcement authorities and the companies asked the
FCC to defer a decision on the transaction until the outstanding concerns
could be resolved (TR, Dec. 25, 2000).  DoJ and the FBI now say they won't
oppose the FCC's approving license transfers associated with the transaction
as long as the terms of their agreement with the carriers are conditions of
the approval.

In a petition filed with the FCC in International docket 00-187, DoJ and the
FBI said the agreement pays particular attention to the German government's
control or influence over DT.  DT says the government is not involved in its
operations.  The German government currently owns 60% of DT; its interest in
the combined entity would decline to about 45% after DT's acquisitions of
VoiceStream and Powertel, Inc.

Among other things, the agreement stipulates that DT shall not disclose
classified or sensitive information, subscriber information, or transactional
or call data to any foreign government.  It also requires DT officials to
notify the FBI and DoJ if a foreign government attempts to participate in
day-to-day management of DT or exercise control of it in a way that
interferes with the carrier's obligations to abide by the agreement.  The
agreement was reached Jan. 12.

"Although the agreement does not eliminate every law enforcement, national
security, or public safety risk posed by the proposed transactions, it does
reduce those risks while affording the companies treatment consistent with
other carriers in like circumstances," the FBI and DoJ said in their petition.

Intelsat Told To Disclose Privatization Info

The FCC's International Bureau has required Intelsat LLC to disclose certain
information-including its draft shareholder's agreement and bylaws-to parties
who agree to be bound by a protective order.

Intelsat LLC is the privatized entity slated to succeed the intergovernmental
organization Intelsat this spring.  On Dec. 18, 2000, it asked for
confidential treatment of "supplemental" information it was filing in the FCC'
s proceeding to determine whether the privatization complies with a U.S. law
passed last year (the Open-Market Reorganization for the Betterment of
International Telecommunications Act).

In its order released Jan. 29, the FCC required Intelsat LLC to file copies
of the most up-to-date versions of its novation agreement, distribution
agreement, and related documents within seven days after the March Intelsat
board of governors meeting.  The FCC also extended the deadlines for
commenting on the supplemental filing.  Comments now are due Feb. 22;
replies, March 5; and responses to replies, March 12.

Don't Exempt Foreign Agencies From Ex Parte Rules, Carriers Say

Only two carriers weighed in on the FCC's proposal to exempt foreign
regulators from rules requiring them to report on their communications with
FCC officials, but both vehemently opposed the plan.  They said the rules
protect regulated entities by making the FCC's deliberations "transparent."

Communications from the U.S. Department of Justice or the Federal Trade
Commission regarding "a telecommunications competition matter in a proceeding
which has not been designated for hearing and in which the relevant agency is
not a party or commenter" are exempt from the FCC's rules requiring parties
to report such ex parte communications.  In December 2000, the FCC proposed
widening that exemption to include "international and foreign governmental
bodies that exercise similar jurisdiction over relevant matters" (TR,Dec. 18,
2000).

In a rulemaking notice released in General Counsel docket 00-219, the FCC
cited increased globalization and international mergers as reasons for the
proposed rule change.  The FCC said the rule change would encourage "
effective, expedited, and consistent" communications among antitrust and
competition policy-makers.

The Competitive Telecommunications Association said extending the exemption "
would impair significantly both the due-process rights of parties
participating in affected proceedings as well as the FCC's ability to render
a decision based on a complete record."

Communications between the FCC and foreign regulators raise different
questions from those between the FCC and DoJ or the FTC, CompTel said.  It
argued that foreign regulatory bodies "operate under laws and regulations
that may embody substantially different competition goals" than the FCC
pursues, unlike DoJ or the FTC, which operate under a "complementary
statutory scheme."

Many foreign governments maintain interests or have close ties to "commercial
enterprises that may be affected by the FCC's decisions in merger cases," it
continued.

And Vodafone Group plc, through its business unit Vodafone Americas Asia
Region, Inc., said the rationale behind the rule change the FCC cited was
insufficient.  If the FCC wanted to communicate with foreign regulators "on
general methods of analysis, for example, or general approaches to evaluating
licenses transfers," those communications would not fall under ex parte
rules.  The rulemaking notice "does not explain why, in the context of a
specific proceeding, the ex parte rules hinder exchange of information," it
said.

Vodafone questioned whether the FCC has authority under the federal
Administrative Procedure Act to "afford foreign government agencies the same
treatment as [domestic] regulatory agencies."  The APA's "whole record" and
due-process safeguards that ensure that parties may comment on the entire
record of a proceeding are underlying principles of federal agencies' ex
parte rules, Vodafone said.  The APA makes an "express distinction" between
U.S. and non-U.S. government agencies, it added.

Vodafone acknowledged that there might be situations in which disclosure of
an interagency ex parte communication "is not advisable."  But it said the
FCC should address those situations case by case.

Unlicensed International Carriers Given 90 Days To Come Forward

The FCC's International and Enforcement bureaus have given carriers and
operators 90 days to turn themselves in if they've been offering
international services or facilities without proper authorization.  The
International Bureau doesn't "expect" to undertake enforcement actions
against violators that come forward and seek the required authorization, but
cases of noncompliance discovered after the three-month period will be
referred to the Enforcement Bureau, the two bureaus said.

Their actions were prompted by requests from "a number" of carriers for
authorization to provide international services, after they were already
doing so, the bureaus said in a Jan. 30 public notice.  They also cited
instances of companies' belatedly seeking permission to assign or transfer
control of their authorizations to provide international facilities or to
land submarine cables.

The 90-day period will begin on the date the public notice appears in the
Federal Register.  Once the notice is published, the International Bureau's
Telecommunications Division "will be extremely reluctant to grant requests
for nunc pro tunc approval [as though timely filed] of belatedly filed
applications," the notice says.

Section 214 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, requires carriers
to obtain FCC authorization before they begin providing international telecom
services.

FCC Delays 700 MHz Auction Again at Request of Industry

Major wireless carriers are praising the FCC's decision to postpone, for the
fourth time, an auction of spectrum licenses in the 700 megahertz band.  But
a group representing rural carriers and a major TV broadcaster say the action
wasn't necessary.

The decision to postpone the auction from March 6 until Sept. 12 was needed "
to provide additional time for bidder preparation and planning" and for other
auction administrative reasons, the FCC's Wireless Telecommunications Bureau
said in a public notice released Jan. 31.

The action came after Verizon Wireless and other large carriers cited a host
of concerns they said could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the
frequencies.  In a Jan. 18 letter to the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau,
Verizon Wireless said carriers needed time to assess their spectrum needs and
form alliances between the reaucti
