I have just returned to the office, and am making it through my E-mails
gradually.  It seems that Clickpaper.com is the concern of this memo.  I am
not up to speed on this European effort.  I suggest this:  I would suggest a
conference call to discuss.  I would also like for Clickpapaer to be there,
so if you provide me a name of your Clickpapaer contact, I'll make sure they
are included.  Also please provide an assistant's name, and I'll have Yvette
schedule the call.
In the meantime, I'll talk with the Clickpaper people here to get up to speed
on their plans.
Thanks for the E-mail.
