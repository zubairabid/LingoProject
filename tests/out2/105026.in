Kevin,

We are in final draft of an agreement with Natsource to allow them to execute on EnronOnline numbers for their clients.  The system should be functional within 3 weeks.  We had agreed to give Natsource access to North American Gas and Power and they are now requesting coal and emissions also.  We have no obligation however I think that it would give you potential deal flow with no brokerage fee on transactions done online.  I need to get back with Jack Cogan pretty quickly.  Is it ok with you?
