Mark's synopsis pretty well says it all.  Once again, the CPUC is in a panic
and is attempting to change the rules in the middle of the game.  I'm not
sure I can make as clear a connection as Mark has between the actions of
interstate pipelines, particularly Transwestern, who, basically, are allowed
to charge just a tariff rate for upstream transport, and the huge dislocation
of basis spread between producing area and California border.  Therefore, I
don't necessarily see us being sullied by the El Paso issue.  I think our
biggest PR problem is probably our affiliation with Enron Online.
We'll continue to monitor this situation.  One thing is clear... fireworks
will certainly be forthcoming when the QF's are being paid on a formula
weighted predominantly with basin pricing, rather than border prices.  Not to
be be too esoteric here, but remember, there are a number of factors at
play.  QF's by contract are obligated to produce electricity when called on.
They are paid capacity payments by the utilities for that purpose.  It will
be interesting to see how many of the QF's tell Edison, PG&E, SDG&E, et al.
to go "fly a kite" when they know that if they produce a MW of electricity,
their commodity payments will put them under water.
