PRIVILEGED ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION

Steve, Karl and Tom

I met with Karl this morning.  My suggestion is that, from this point
forward, all communications with the trailer park should be coordinated with
the legal department and all of our communications internally should be
prefaced with "Attorney-Client Privileged Communication".   Any
correspondence or information that I request from you or that you send me
should be prefaced as "Attorney-Client Privileged".  Karl is to duplicate his
file for me and to document dates on which conversations or meetings have
taken place thus far.  I will draft a letter for Steve's signature to be sent
to the owners of the trailer park and their attorney demanding that they
immediately remove the two trailers that are sitting within 6' and 1' of the
pipe centerline AND the two trailers that are within 16' of the pipe
centerline.  In my opinion, you should strictly construe the terms of the
right of way agreement which is of public record that states that the grantor
shall not permit ANY housing or other structure to be within the right of
way.  I also will advise them that the trees in the right of way are going to
be removed.  I will endeavor to visit with Bud Wolcott and the Lumberton team
regarding this matter.

I am sending this to you as a "heads up" of possible litigation arising out
of our demand for these trailer homes to be moved off of HPL's easement.
We have a 50' recorded easement prohibiting structures from being  on or
within the right of way.  The engineer that designed the trailer park wrongly
assumed it was only 30' wide.  Four trailers are within the easement.  Large
pine trees are in the easement area and literally on top of the pipeline.
Obviously, it will be HPL's nickel to cut down the trees but I anticipate
there may be a dispute as to who pays for the trailers to be moved out of the
easement area.  They have retained an attorney; however, he has, thus far,
not disputed HPL's right to prohibit structures within 25' of the pipe
centerline.  Let me know if you need more details.  I'll keep you advised.
