Vince,
I reviewed all information available on the web site. There is a template
that shows what kind of data SwapsMonitor provides on commodities, but
unfortunately this template is a blank one and no example of the table given.
To receive any actual data we have to subscribe to their service ($200 -
single delivery, $300 - annual subscription).
Below is the template that given for commodity derivatives:
The data in this database is derived from audited financial statements,
regulatory filings, reports to shareholders.
I will be glad to write a summary report.
