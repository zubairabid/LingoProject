DAN - I've made a few modifications to the above referenced agreement to
reflect volume changes and pricing changes associated with the GRE deal.  The
deal structure has been modified to reflect an increase in the DCQ, a  $0.05
demand charge per DCQ and the ability for GRE to decrease its DCQ monthly.
Could you please review the changes I made, as well as clarify that the
respective pricing reflects gas purchased "day-ahead", not intraday.
Intraday gas sells will be negotiated/ quoted on an "as needed" basis.

What does not appear to be addressed in any of the contracts to be executed
by ENA and GRE is the agency relationship that will exist whereby ENA will
handle nominations, scheduling, invoicing , etc... The intent of our overall
arrangement with GRE is to provide an agency relationship pursuant to the
June 1, 2000 TRANSACTION TERM SHEET.  Is this agency arrangement going to be
documented separately?  If so, please prepare a draft.  Otherwise, please
incorporate into the below agreement language consistent with the June 1st
Transaction Term Sheet under the section entitled "OPERATIONS".



OSCAR - I've modified the agreement to reflect IF-FOM at Ventura for the DCQ
and GDA-Common High for all volumes in excess of the DCQ.  Also, as you note
above, I'm instructing Dan to clarify that this is day ahead gas.  Carl, in
his June 23rd term sheet broke out the pricing mechanism to include a "day
of" price.  I don't think we should show a price for intraday gas in the
Winter.  It will be overly expensive and probably will never be utilized.
Also, Carl raises the issue of utilizing third parties when ENA cannot
service their account (blancing services, etc...)  Conceptually, I am
indifferent, but if they don't use us than we don't nominate or schedule.
