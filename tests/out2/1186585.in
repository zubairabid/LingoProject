In light of the rising frequency of human-grizzly bear conflicts, the
Montana Department of Fish and Game is advising hikers, hunters, and
fishermen to take extra precautions and keep alert of bears while in the
field.
We advise that outdoorsmen wear noisy little bells on their clothing, so as
not to startle bears that aren't expecting them.  We also advise outdoorsmen
to carry pepper spray with them in case of an encounter with a bear.  It is
also a good idea to watch out for fresh signs of bear activity.  Outdoorsmen
should recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear dung.
Black bear dung is smaller and contains lots of berries and squirrel fur.
Grizzly bear dung has little bells in it and smells like pepper.


You guys around this weekend?
