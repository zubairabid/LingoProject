I can certainly send you this file each day - I hope it can be of some help.
All the deals it lists are with EPMI Short Term California, which is myself
or Jeff Richter; so I'm not sure how helpful it will be in determining which
desk or counterparty you have discrepancies with. While we're on the subject
of sharing files, though, I had spoken with the confirmation group in Houston
about the deal file you send them each day. They suggested I ask to be added
to the list so I can better assist their group in finding discrepancies in
EPMI-EES deals. If that's okay with you, I would appreciate receiving it.
In the meantime, I'll copy you on the EES sale prices starting tomorrow.
