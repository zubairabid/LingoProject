The incremental financing cost, by my calculation is less than 100,000 and it
was determined to be prudent in light of ENA's interest in keeping these
off-balance sheet, regardless of their use in Canada or the US.  My estimate
is based on 26MM balance, four month average duration (staggered payments),
6% interest rate and 15% withholding tax.  Matt Berry of ENA Finance and
Morris Clark were part of our discussion on this matter.  The reason that we
do not look at it over an extended term is becasue this West LB structure was
put in place as a bridge until Enron determined if the machines were to be
used in Canada or the US.  At that time Enron would put in place either a
Canadian or US permanent structure that would be more tax-efficient.
I am available to talk about this further.  Let me know.
