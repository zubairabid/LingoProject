Howdy all! SUE NELSON at AURORA GAS COMPANY (based in Michigan) is asking for
information pertaining to what actions are necessary to establish a MASTER
PURCHASE CONTRACT with ENA.

What she is looking for: They are a small Utility that is looking for a FIRM
PURCHASE contract taking gas to "Mich Gas Station" (?). They are looking at
approximately 300,000 MMBTu a year and are looking for a 2 - 3 year contract.

Sue Nelson can be reached at 517-733-6625.

We have not yet done business with this counterparty, so they are not in any
of our Global systems.
(Their address is (per smartpages.com) 7038 S Black River Rd, Onaway, MI
49765. (She left her fax number instead of a phone, by the way - - - - -
their fax is 571.733.6626)

Please let me know if I can do anything else to help.

Thanks!!
