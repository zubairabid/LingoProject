Dear Mr. Lay:

On behalf of The Economist Group, I have the pleasure of inviting you to join
a select group of your peers at the second in our series of US E-Business
Summits, "Strategic business transformation for chief executives in the
digital economy". The E-Business Summit will take place at the JW Marriott in
Atlanta on October 2nd-3rd and subsequently at the Ritz-Carlton Lenox in
Chicago on October 18th-19th. To learn more about this event visit us at

Your name has been included on a short list of the nation,s most powerful
corporate decision-makers invited to attend the Summit as our guest. If you
wish to accept this invitation, please RSVP directly to Melissa Thoms on

The Economist Group founded the US e-business series in March 2000 with
summits in New York and California. Speakers and delegates at those events
included the chief executives of Cisco Systems, Nike, Palm Inc, DoubleClick,
Nordstrom.com, Fair Isaac, International Creative Management, Schlumberger,
Block Drug Company and DLJdirect.

The purpose of the e-business series is to address the concerns of CEOs at
corporations founded on old-economy principles as they struggle to respond to
the imperatives created by web-enabled technology. Corporate leaders are
invited to learn from their peers at blue-chip companies who are now setting
the pace of change as they rethink vital business functions from supply chain
to customer service.

Bill Emmott, Editor of The Economist, will serve as chairman of the Atlanta
Summit, and John Peet, Business Affairs Editor of The Economist, will chair
the Chicago Summit.
