As I believe I've mentioned to both of you, ENA has entered into an
Electronic Trading Agreement that clearly provides that physical gas and
financial transactions will be governed by specified Master Agreements in
lieu of the online GTCs.  I wanted to let you know what those underlying
contracts are so that you can confirm that you are comfortable trading on
DynegyDirect pursuant to their terms.

Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement, dated July 1, 1993 governs natural gas
transactions

Master Agreement, dated January 27, 1992 governs financial transactions.
