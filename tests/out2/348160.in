I need you to run these items by Rick.  I take full responsibility for
approving the hiring of the Hills firm (and I look forward to meeting with
you and Carla as we discussed), but remain hopeful we can use their services
for something other than WTO.  In the wake of Seattle, and as I have come to
understand better what the WTO can and cannot do for us on the energy
services front, I have come to the view that our talent and money would be
better spent on other activities.  My inclination is to do the bare minimum
necessary to keep the machine going.  If we have specifically committed to
certain things, then let's follow through.  If there are things we can avoid,
let's avoid them.  Specifically with respect to Fischer going to Geneva, Why
not have him available by phone at all hours to provide assistance and mage
that known to USG instead of underwriting additional travel.  With respect to
the Hills firm, can we use the retained time to help with the specific
strategies we are now working out for the regions?  These are the kinds of
things we need to consider.
