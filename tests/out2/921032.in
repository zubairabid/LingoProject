How do we get the right focus on support for Calgary?  Mark Taylor wanted to
hold up transferring confirm responsibility to Calgary, so we still need to
provide excellent service to them.  While I can appreciate that Diane is out,
that should actually be a red flag to us to pay even closer attention to the
Calgary stuff.  Every screw up looks big to them, and they can't understand
how mistakes continue to happen.  While I know that they can't appreciate the
vast number of transactions that the group is currently handling, we still
need to be able to deliver top notch service.  Unfortunately, we stub our toe
enough with Calgary that they view of our operation is one that delivers
pretty poor to average service.  That is a terrible internal PR issue.  Let's
put our heads together on not just the confirm issue but all of our dealings
with Calgary so that we quickly turn around our error rate (and/or their
perceptions) and  can sustain excellent service. I am copying Susan because
she has dealt recently with an issue brought to our attention by  Rob
Milnthorp (president of Enron Canada).  She responded to Rob quickly and
handled things professionally, so she may not have shared the details with
you at the time.  But now we need to look at all of our outstanding,
potential or past issues with Calgary and get a solution in place.  She can
fill you in on the details in that situation.
Susan:  Do you have any ideas on how we can reshape our image with Calgary?
