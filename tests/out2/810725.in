For January 2000 for a couple of weekends SJersey tried to do intradays.  Due
to the interconnect and other supply we were not able to change their
nominations.  South Jersey have always been told that changing nomination on
the weekend would be on best available.  Julie Punches from Sjersey due to
her changes on the weekend is over at some of her CDC markets is asking to
allocate the excess gas to CES agg pools.
Would this be something Enron would do???
