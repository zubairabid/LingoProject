The Title V air permit for C/S No. 4 has been issued. There are some
requirements and conditions under this permit that the team should be aware
of and will be required to comply with.   I would like to visit with the team
at their safety meeting in June or july to go over the conditions of the
permit.  Please give the the dates in June and July when your next safety
meeting is.  This Title V presentation should last about 3 hours.

Thanx
