I will be out of the office Wednesday through Friday, March 15-17 to be with
my children during part of their spring break.  We will be in town, so I can
be reached either at home (281-370=8568) or on my cell phone (713-417-1591).
I will check voice mail messages during this time period, but probably once
or twice a day.

I will be in the London office next week.  I will be in that office from
about noon on Monday through the end of the day on Thursday.  Patti will have
a schedule of my appointments while I am there, and she will have an
international cell phone number that I will have with me throughout the
trip.  Contact her if you need to speak directly with me.  I will be
responding to voice mail frequently throughout the week.  I will be
travelling back to Houston on Friday, March 24 (leaving my hotel in London
around 1 AM Houston time).

I will see you back in the office on Monday, March 27.
