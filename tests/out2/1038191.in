As we move into the Spring/Summer of 2000, it is time to turn our attention
to the performance review process.  Mid-year is always busy and we have a
number of important tasks and projects in process.  While recognizing this,
it remains extremely important to take time over the next few weeks to gather
necessary information to provide quality and meaningful feedback for our
employees, as well as utilize this information during the year end review
process.

In the spirit of One Enron, the Performance Review Process (PRC) will be
global for Mid-year 2000.  Vice Presidents and above across all operating
companies will be reviewed and discussed in a consistent manner with
identical criteria.   ENA will review all professional level and above
employees.  The timeline and training for the midyear process are outlined at
the end of this memo.  Your HR Business Consultant is also available to
answer questions.

With regards to the Global Functions, review sessions will be led by the
Global and/or Corporate Functional heads, and will be designed to calibrate
personnel within these areas of expertise.  The Global Functional Review
Areas include:

_ NetWorks/Technology
_ Accounting
_ RAC
_ Finance
_ Human Resources
_ Public Relations & Reg Affairs	G. Whalley
R. Causey
R.  Buy
A. Fastow
C. Olson
S. Kean

ENA Mid-Year Process:

ENA has received favorable feedback on the review process used for Mid-year
and Year-end 1999, and as such, will follow the same general guidelines and
process for Mid-year 2000.  The following are key features of the Mid-year
2000 process:

o The focus of the feedback will continue to be on the qualitative aspects,
as opposed to quantitative.  Toward this end, communication of the employee,s
explicit ranking will be left to the discretion of the business unit manager.
o Initial discussions with employees regarding their accomplishments, are
highly encouraged, prior to the Business Review Meetings.
o Mid-year performance results will be used as baseline performance
information for Year-end 2000.
o Creation of 3 standard feedback forms for all peer groups.
o Standardization of criteria for all peer groups.
o   Utilization of a consistent 6 gradation rating scale.
o All exempt employees will be discussed at Business Review Meetings and
placed into one of six categories by peer group.  ENA VP's will be pre-ranked
by the ENA Office of the Chairman and Managing Directors prior to the Enron
PRC.  Non-exempt (overtime eligible) employees will be evaluated by their
supervisors and placed into one of the 6 categories.  The results of the
Business Review Meetings will be the final rankings for exempt employees
below VP, subject to ENA Office of the Chairman.
o A minimum of two representatives from other functional areas will be
required at the Business Review Meetings.  The meetings should otherwise be
rescheduled to allow this very important representation to take place.  The
nominated individuals are illustrated below.
o The top 5 HR priorities/challenges for 2000 should also be agreed to at the
Business Review Meetings.
o Analysts and Associates will be pre-reviewed in a Business Review Meetings
based on their current rotation, then cross-calibrated at the Enron Global
Analyst and Associate Business Review Meeting.
