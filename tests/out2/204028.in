La Nina Dissipates But Effects Linger

El Nino and La Nina, the terrible twins blamed for destructive weather
patterns worldwide for the last three or four years, have finally
dissipated.  However, their impact on the weather will likely continue for
some time to  come, according to NASA scientists, based on the latest
satellite data  gathered this month over the Pacific. While Pacific water
temperatures have  gradually warmed over the past three to four months to
near normal in the  tropics, the after effects of La Nina are seen in
persistent below-normal  temperatures in the Bering Sea and Gulf of Alaska.
