Thanks for the movie advice.  I am glad that you went out with Kathy and
Charlene.  I think it is good for you guys to keep in touch.  I know people
move on with their lives and grow out of touch but it seems like you guys
have been friends for so long that it would be a shame for you to not keep in
touch with each other.  Sorry we got in a fight yesterday. :(
