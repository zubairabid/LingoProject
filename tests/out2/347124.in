Msg. from Rick Shapiro

I know how eagerly everyone is awaiting the formation of the Resource
Allocation Working group*.  Below is a brief description of the group's
purpose and initial steps we will be taking.  I want to thank everyone in
advance for what I know will be a successful effort.

What this group is about:       Identifying best practices within Public
Affairs for prioritization of efforts and allocation of resources and
documenting the best practices for implementation as soon as possible
throughout Public Affairs.

How we're going to do it:  Quickly and efficiently.

Why we're doing this:  Because we have finite human and financial
resources.... because we have an obligation to direct those finite resources
to their highest and best use.

When we're going to start this process:  Initial meeting in Houston, January
7, 2000 from 8:00am - 11:00am (call in participation is perfectly acceptable).

What's required for initial meeting:  A one page or less description of how
your group prioritizes its efforts; how both human and financial resources
are allocated, and how all of this fits within your budgeting process (should
be distributed to all group members two (2) days prior to meeting).

Finally:  I am attaching material that my group has used over the last year
to implement a resource allocation/issue priortization process.  I will
provide a more detailed explanation at the initial meeting.  Please feel free
to call me if you have any questions before then.

*  You've either been nominated or selected, or volunteered for this working
group.  Congratulations.
