it's possible that we could get pulled into the chevron matter but with our
limited usage - i doubt it.  i would not look any further.

Duke probably is required to facilitate the TW remediation but likely is not
required to maintain the lease...roger - is it possible to contact Duke and
find out what their plans are and if they intend to abandon - possibly get
them to assign or sublease a portion of the site to us???
