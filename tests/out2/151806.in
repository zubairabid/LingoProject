Steal industry

From The Economist print edition

ON THE face of it, the bankruptcy of a steelmaker, LTV, is another sad story
about a once-dominant company in a once-mighty industry. Though its $2
billion of debts are not trivial, the case would have got little attention
but for a nuance in LTV,s bankruptcy filing in an Ohio court that has alarmed
some of the world,s biggest lenders.
The crux of the issue is whether a desperate plea for money that the court is
hearing this week will undermine one of the great acts of financial alchemy
in recent years: to wit, cheap financing for bad creditors. Reams of papers
have been filed by two of LTV,s main creditors, Chase Manhattan Bank (now
merged with J.P. Morgan) and Abbey National, a British bank. An adverse
ruling from the court would be a blow to plenty of other banks.
Behind the litigation are LTV,s efforts in the early 1990s to fund a
capital-intensive business as cheaply as an earlier bankruptcy in 1986 and
difficult operating conditions would allow. The solution, which has been
applied by too many other American companies to count, was to create a couple
of special-purpose vehicles*essentially, independent legal entities. These
were supposedly insulated from the risk of their parent going bankrupt. The
first of these vehicles contained LTV,s receivables (what it was owed by
customers), and the second its inventory (piles of steel). LTV would inject
assets into these entities, paid for by attractively priced asset-backed
loans. The size of these loan facilities last year, according to Standard &
Poor,s, was about $650m, or equivalent to slightly more than half of LTV,s
total long-term debt.
When LTV filed for bankruptcy on December 29th, everything seemed normal (if
normality is an empty till and 18,000 employees wondering whether they have a
job). Alarms started ringing at the commercial banks when it became clear
that LTV was going to argue in court that it could use as it liked (ie, not
necessarily to repay interest and principal on the asset-backed loans) the
money got from receivables*since, it claimed, the original transfer of the
receivables to the special-purpose vehicles was not a sale but a &disguised
finance transaction8. The alarms rang louder when the judge appeared to be
sympathetic to LTV,s arguments. The case continues. If the judge rules in LTV,
s favour, there will be intense pain and embarrassment at many banks.
