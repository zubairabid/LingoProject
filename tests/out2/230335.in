Mark:

Credit has asked us to pursue trading arrangements on behalf of Enovate.

At least for the short term, Mark Haedicke told Kay Mann that ENA legal
should handle Enovate legal work.  That work currently consists of
establishing documentation for financial trading with third parties.  It is
not clear what lawyers (ENA or Peoples) will draft/negotiate ISDA masters nor
have any forms been agreed (but Peoples' lawyers have seen our forms and I
have seen their forms which are poorly drafted).  Bill Bradford will have the
final word on Enovate credit.

Credit has asked us to track Enovate masters on our Lotus Notes database.

Do you need to follow up with Mark about us negotiating Enovate's master
agreements?  Or should we just handle as any other project?
