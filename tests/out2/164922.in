Hi Sue:

I hope the packing and other move-related things are going well---I know that
something invariably happens that creates havoc.  Good luck.

I haven't wanted to bug you too much with all that's going on, so I thought
I'd give you a quick update:

Scott and Bowen and I talked re: getting authority for EBS to dig dirt and
install some facilities in California.  With some effort, we persuaded Scott
that having dinner with Loretta Lynch, well, wasn't going to do get the job
done (though Scott's not yet completely convinced).  Instead, Scott's going
to get from the network folks substantially more detail on precisely what the
project entails.  Once we've got that, we can meet with Commission staff and
take their temperature on what sort of approval hoops we'd need to jump
through in order to get authority to do the project, and what the time frame
for approval would look like.  Scott agrees with this approach.  He's going
to try to get more info from the network folks in Portland.  We likely will
regroup to figure out "next steps" right after the first of the year.  Have
any thoughts on this approach?
I do plan on coming every Thursday to the group meetings.  However, this
Thursday is my girlfriend's birthday, and her parents (who live in the area)
have had a little "special  event" planned for the past 6 months.
Consequently, I will have to miss the GA Xmas party, which I'm very
disappointed about----I really enjoy getting a chance to catch up with
everyone.  I'll also therefore have to participate in Thursday's call by
phone.  Apologies, but I'm sticking to the tried and true rule:  "Family and
relationships first!"

Hope all is well.

Best,
Jeff
