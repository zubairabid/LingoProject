Sherrie and Rosie:  Jeff and Ken both received notes from Tom Delay about
designating portions of their contributions for use  in Texas.  Mr. DeLay
would like them to make that designation using the letter below (note that it
will need to be modified to be from each individually rather than a joint
letter).  It is, of course, up to Ken and Jeff whether to make the
designation.
