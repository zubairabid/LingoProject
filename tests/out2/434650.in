Mark,
Thanks again for you quick help on the Totality NDA.  No word yet from them.
Below is an NDA from Sabre Corporation, which I received today.   As you may
know, Sabre is mostly known as a Global Distribution Services company (GDS),
chiefly providing an electronic distribution channel for airline seats to
travel agents and a growing group of internet purveyors.  ENW would like to
explore ways to help Sabre possibly create a new ticket distribution
platform, which may involve imparting the knowledge and systems we have used
in the development of EOL.   I would characterize our discussions as
exploratory.  See Supplement 1 or NDA for Sabre's characterization of
undertaking.
My legal-wannabe eye says you may have issues with paragraph 5, 7 and 9.
Let me know if I should provide you with anything further.  Brenda Crabtree's
number is below.  I assume she is with Sabre's legal group.  They seem fairly
intent on using their NDA.
