Allyson,

We'd like to keep CPL/NCNG out of the middle for as long as possible.  I'm
sure they already know what we are up to, but I'd rather not lay it out for
them.  So I'd prefer if Gisele Rankin did not discuss our plans to purchase
gas from Rocky Mount.   If she happens to run into the CPL lawyer and he asks
her again about this, tell her to say Enron is still working on fuel supply
alternatives.

We should start the process of annexing the land hopefully very soon.  Once
Rocky Mount has the property annexed, they have a much stronger argument for
serving the load and NCNG won't be able to hold us hostage to their
uncompetitive rates.

Thanks for the heads up.

Regards,

Heather
