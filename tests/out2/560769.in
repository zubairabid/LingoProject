Here are companies I've uncovered so far that look like potential competitors
or who offer similar product for specifically the financial industry.

Arcordia
OMR Systems-Back Office Outsourcing
GlobeOp Financial Services - not a competitor, but I like the way they
promote/position their services
Energy Services Group (ESG) - maybe ?
Orcom Solutions
