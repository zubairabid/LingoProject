Steve and Rick:  I attempted to strengthen the latest draft of the
Stakeholder letter per your instructions on our most recent conference call.
Unfortunately, we have pushed to the point that APPA, the consumer groups and
most utilities will no longer sign the letter per their e-mail below.  It now
looks like no letter will be sent.  If you would like, Enron, EPSA, ELCON and
ACC only can send a revised stronger letter or alternatively, just bag the
idea.  The utilities are split not wishing to let APPA appear more reliable
then them.  I will forward the MidAmerican letter for your files which does
support our position per my request.  I feel it is unfortunate that now APPA
will send a strong support letter instead of signing our modified version.
Per his request, I will meet with Congressman Wynn's Chief of Staff next week
upon his return from vacation to discuss their strategy.   thanks.
