Janine -

I have speaking with the FX desk about the status o the roll-out of the
Currency Exchange products on EnronOnline, and apparently they are a little
frustrated; they continue to reiterate that what they are trying to
accomplish Online is the same kind of transactions that they currently do
over the phone.

That being the case, I asked for an example of a Confirmation of such a
transaction. Attached please find a confirmation between RMT and ETRIC dated
July 10, 2000. Laurel Adams of the FX documentation unit explains that Trena
McFarland, a trader in the UK, regularly does non-proprietary FX transactions
on the behalf of RMT. Laurel has been assured that this is appropriate, but
we a re unable to locate any clear 'policy' or 'instruction' in this regard.

So, we either have a situation where this issue is being handled
inappropriately on the FX desk and needs to be corrected for their OTC
transactions as well as EOL, or there's some loophole or other piece of
information that is missing from the equation we are trying to solve for.

I think it goes without saying that, whatever the case, we at EOL will follow
the lead given by our Tax and Legal Departments - and I would hope that we
will find a quick, AND FINAL, resolution.
