Hi Kate, can you please ask all of the traders to add contacts to their
trades.  Starting today we are confirming west daily trades.  Christian Yoder
thought it would be a good idea to start confirming these trades.  If you
look at the attachment below you will see how many deals we will have to open
up to attach a contact to.  We are going to try to get our IT group to fix
the system so that the confirm would populate with a default contact whether
one has been chosen in Enpower or not.  This may take a while for them to do.
