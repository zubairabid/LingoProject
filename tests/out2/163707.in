Gang,
I didn't get Jim's e-mail but .....  Here are my comments
This looks good as a bottomline message, but I'd like to dress it up and take
it out on a date first (doesn't dasovich talk like this?)
I'm afraid we'll look greedy unless we focus strongly on the RETAIL affect of
the low price cap and how raising it would ultimately allow retail customers
to save money and wholesale markets to work more efficiently.  there is some
stuff we can quote in the iso's market surveillance com report.  we also have
some real world experience to draw upon (i'm told that FERC occasionally
really likes to hear about the real world) -- we had a number of customers on
demand responsiveness plans in the east and we sent them checks for BIG BUCKS
this summer.  To the contrary, in the west, we were working with some
customers (a  few hundred MWs)  to participate in the ISO's program -- after
the Board voted to lower the cap to $250 -- the customers all said sayonara
-- could no longer justify the expense and the interference in their
operations.  These are powerful examples of how price caps influence retail
demand response.
This only goes so far, however...
The FERC could easily eliminate the problem by exempting demand side bids
from the price caps.  SO, we need more...
I think we should focus on the practical effects of a "soft" cap (not simple
and not certain) -- and how stable markets need stable price caps -- "soft"
caps are not a stable price and do not send a stable signal for investment in
new generation (the market may never know the real price since it doesn't set
the MCP). The staff report provides some good evidence on why the caps are
too low and we could also use the ISO's calculation of prices for short-term
peaking capacity.  Then mention the issues Mary discussed below (information;
cap mechanism bad for power marketers in particular)
