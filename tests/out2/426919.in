There is no documentation to evidence this, it is an operation of law.  Being
a legal incorporated entity means you are embodied as a legal entity after
filing or creating certain organizational documents under state or federal
laws (you could be a corporation, partnership,  governmental entity or other
type of entity).   A division is not a separate legal incorporated entity.
It is one and the same entity as the incorporated entity.   It is a "dba"
(which means "doing business as") or "assumed name" for an incorporated
entity. Any division of an incorporated entity can, and usually should, trade
under the same master as the incorporated entity (unless the company gives us
some reason elsewise).  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not
understand that a division and incorporated entity are one and the same, or
there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their trading from being
aggregated.That is why we always want the name of the incorporated entity as
part of the counterparty name when we transact with a division.  Examples
might be "Tana Jones Inc., acting through its TLJ Company Division" or "Tana
Jones Inc. d/b/a TLJ  Company" or "TLJ Company, a division of Tana Jones
Inc."  Frequently, the dealmakers at the company may not understand that a
division and incorporated entity are one and the same (and we may have to
talk to them), or there may be a corporate policy that prohibits their
trading from being aggregated with the corporate entity.  Legal and/or Credit
should direct you when a division should trade under the legal entity's
master.
