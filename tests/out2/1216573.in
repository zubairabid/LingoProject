FPC, FPL and TECO filed a lengthy response to all the protests of its amended
filing.  Recall that EPMI filed a protest asking GridFlorida to implement a
real time energy market and remove the day ahead balanced schedule
requirement.   Dan Staines and Mike Roan are doing a good job because rather
than replying that the real time energy market is a bad idea, the GridFlorida
utilities responded that they are not necessarily opposed as a theoretical
matter, there were some practical considerations that led them not to include
such a market in their proposal, including "(1) concerns that unbalanced
schedules will not work without either some form of forward market or a
centralized unit commitment process; (2) concerns that GridFlorida be able to
demonstrate the ability to administer a market with balanced schedules before
considering unbalanced schedules; and (3) concerns about the impact of market
power in the region on the larger real-time energy market that would result
from unbalanced schedules."  Grid Florida then stresses that the decision to
require balanced schedules is not necessarily meant to be permanent and the
ability to submit unbalanced schedules, if not raised sooner, would be an
issue for further consideration in the report on market design due within 18
months after commencement and that GridFlorida has complete freedom to
propose changes to its tariff, which it could do at anytime (through the
Advisory Committee.)
