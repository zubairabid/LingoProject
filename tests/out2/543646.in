I have compiled all the required information needed  to complete  the New
Shipper Affirmation Form that you faxed me yesterday.  The completed form
will be faxed to you to sign  as the duly  authorized representative.   I
will provide copies of the DOE Docket , NEB License Order and the approval
memo below as support and update authorization changes to Maritime as they
occur.    Please fax  a  signed copy of the Affirmation Form to me at
(713)646-8875.  You may fax,  or request that I fax the finished document to
Maritimes per their directions.   I will need a contact person at Maritime to
provide pipeline  information on the manifest quantities on a monthly basis
to insure accurate reporting to Customs.
Thanks,
Juanita
