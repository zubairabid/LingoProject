The Hearings
The hearings have transitioned to the more traditional, courtroom-like
environment, with lawyers engaged in detailed cross-examination of utility
witnesses.
The hearing focused solely on the utility claims of financial hardship.
The hearings went from 9AM-5PM and only managed to make it through two PG&E
witnesses--extensive, detailed questions on PG&E's cash management practices
since restructuring started in 1998.
Questions to witnesses focused in particular on PG&E's use of cash for
investment and financing activities over the past 2-3 years (e.g.,
dividend/stock repurchase activities, transfer of cash from IOU to parent and
parent's use of that cash for investment activities).
Questions also focused on options other than rate increases available to the
utility (e.g., liquidate certain assets of unregulated biz units, loans from
parent, bankruptcy).
The commissioners and the ALJ have reacted in extremely hostile manner toward
PG&E's repeated attempts to amend and add to their proposal as the hearings
progress.
Questioning of PG&E witnesses will continue at 10 AM on Tuesday, followed by
Edison witness.
Unclear when the hearings will end, though the Commission is scheduled to
issue its decision on Thursday.
At this point, it seems very unlikely that the Commission will have developed
the record necessary to do anything other than raise rates under its general
ratemaking authority.

Outside the Hearing
Intense negotiations between Governor's office and utility management
continue.
Seems that the Commission/Administration is beating up on the utilities
inside the hearing room in an attempt to soften the utilities up and gain
some leverage in the negotiations taking place outside the hearing room.
Governor continues to try to bring consumer groups into the negotiations with
utilities, but consumer groups continue to resist and continue to oppose any
rate increases.
Governor seems to be attempting to set up a situation where the Commission
absorbs the political heat for raising rates on the 4th, and the Governor
follows-up with a more comprehensive set of proposals as part of his state of
the state speech on the 8th.
