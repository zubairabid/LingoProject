This issue was much easier when all we traded were energy commodities,
interest rates and currencies. The older versions of the policy provided that
no Enron employee may trade any energy commodity for the account of anyone
other than Enron.  Beyond that, no Enron employee could trade a commodity
which was within their area of responsibility.  For example, I was not
permitted to trade natural gas futures for my own account but, since interest
rates and currencies are not within my area of responsibility, I could trade
them.  As the scope of our trading activities expanded it became more
difficult to identify the scope of the company's concern, much less to
articulate it.  We did however take a stab at it and the result is below.
This may be an area which could stand some clarification in the next version
of the Policy.

For now, I would suggest that the term "security" highlighted below should be
read to include equities and therefore not one of the commodities covered in
the second numbered clause (i.e. the word "other" refers to items other than
those listed in clause (i)).  The result is that an Enron employee who does
not trade financial instruments, securities, financial assets or liabilities
for Enron may trade them for his or her own personal account.  To take this a
step further, one could argue that an employee who trades the equities of
energy companies for Enron should not trade energy company equities for his
or her own account but could trade other equities - if it were me, I would
certainly make sure that Ted Murphy agreed with my analysis before I did it.
Of course, a wide variety of commodities remain clearly off limits for
personal trading - metals, ag commodities, bandwidth, freight, lumber, among
many others - for all employees.  As I remember it, this was done purposely
and if anyone disagrees with the scope of the policy they would be wise to
discuss the matter with the RAC Group as they make suggestions for Policy
revisions to the Enron Corp. board.

Employee Trading.  No employee of any Enron Business Unit may engage in the
trading of any Position for the benefit of any party other than an Enron
Business Unit (whether for their own account or for the account of any third
party) where such Position relates to (i) any financial instrument, security,
financial asset or liability which falls within such employee,s
responsibility at an Enron Business Unit or (ii) any other commodity,
included in any Commodity Group.
