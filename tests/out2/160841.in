Again, here is PG&E trying to shoe horn us on this tap vs. bus connection
issue.  If you are not familiar with this issue, EES elected to utilize the
single tap termination @ the PG&E Bullard Substation in our proposal to
CSUF.  This single tap option was provided to us by PG&E in their
Informational Review.  PG&E itemized this cost in the Informational Review at
$178,000 and this the figure we used.

During past meetings, PG&E has stated that this tap option is no loger
availabele.  PG&E has stated that it is reserved for future expansion and we
must go with a bus connection.  Of course going with a bus connection adds
cost to the scope of work that PG&E will provide at the Bullard Sub.  My
question is there any avenue to contest this?  Would PG&E have a design in
place or have notified the PUC of their intentions to conduct this work?  If
you could give me some suggestions, I would appreciate it.  Or your
thoughts.  I just do not want to yield to PG&E if there is something I can
do.

Thanks
