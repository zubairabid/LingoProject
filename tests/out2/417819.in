Shankman was pushing something with a Citibank sub about 3 months ago.  I
think we were waiting on information from them.
Russell/Brant - please call their contact and request credit information on
the Citibank sub.  Let John Arnold know where we stand after your
discussion.  Loop in Paul for any credit analysis associated with hedge
funds.
Keep me apprised as well.
Bill
