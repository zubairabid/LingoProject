Rushing Game Matchups  Here's how I see the matchups  this week. Please
note, see  thecheatsheet onlinehttp://www.cheatsheets.net/week14sheet.htm
for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start. Just because
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup. The matchup info  is meant
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between
players.

Locks: These games heavily  favor the Offense

Jamal Anderson (Atl) vs Seahawk  Defense  If you,ve learned  anything this
season, it,s start RBs facing the Seahawk defense. Fo the year, they rank #
26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.  Over the last four weeks,
they,ve really tailed off ranking # 31 in  rushing yards allowed per game.
They,re playing for pride and look for Anderson to make a  statement.



Warrick Dunn (TB) vs Cowboy  Defense The Cowboys haven,t gotten any  better
against the rush this year as they still bring up the rear. Over the last
four weeks, they rank # 30  in rushing yards allowed per game.  For the
year, they,re ranked # 30 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RBs.
Dunn,s athletic style  will give them trouble much like Charlie Garner did
earlier the season.

Fred Taylor (Jac) vs Brown  Defense Cleveland struggles against most  any
RB but especially tough, physical rushing teams. Taylor and the Jaguars fit
that  bill. This season has seen some  rushing performances of historical
significance this year. You might see another one this  week. On paper, it,
s a dream  matchup.

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak)  vs Steeler Defense I know it,s hard to believe but
the numbers show that over the past four weeks, Pittsburgh ranks # 28 in
rushing  yards allowed per game. They,re  allowing 171 yards rushing on the
ground.  Granted, Fred Taylor, Eddie George and Corey Dillon figure into
that  number but a healthy Tyrone Wheatley isn,t too far down below their
class. He,s healthier now than he has been in a  while.



Ricky Watters (Sea) vs Falcon  Defense I,ve been a Ricky Watters fan  since
the 49er days. One of the  best combinations of rushing and receiving in
some time. He,s had an age defying season and the  roll should continue
against a Falcon unit that,s been awful defending the run  lately. For the
last four weeks,  they rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed per game. For the
year, they,re # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.  Everyone
keeps wondering  when Shaun Alexander will see time but unless Seattle gets
blown out here (which  I have hard time seeing) I think you,ll see plenty of
Ricky  Watters.

Corey Dillon (Cin) vs  Cardinal Defense Like Fred Taylor vs. Cleveland,
this one looks almost too good to be true on paper. They don,t always turn
out that way in  reality but you,ve got to be drooling over this game if you,
re a Dillon  owner. His running in the lack of a  real passing game threat
is an amazing feat. Hopefully for him Scott Mitchell can be  effective
throwing the ball which will help even more.





Prime  Matchups: These games favor the  Offense

Tony  Richardson / Kimble Anders (KC) vs  Patriot Defense  Our support of
Christian Okoye  last week for a Chief RB didn,t garner much support from the
KC coaching staff  so it looks like another week of Richardson / Anders.
Anders actually got plenty of carries  last week and promptly did very little
with them. Richardson appears to be the  better back right now but who knows
how this will play out. It,s hard for me to advocate  either. But if you do
go with one,  know that they,ll be facing a pretty soft New England rush
defense that ranks #  25 in rushing yards allowed per gameover the  last four
weeks.

Tshimanga Biakabutuka / Brad Hoover (Car) vs Rams  Defense Biakabutuka
found there was  no rehabilitation method quite as effective as 60,000 folks
chanting  &Hoooooo-ver8 on Monday night(  Amazing how that consistently
works. Biakabutuka has been upgraded to  probable but I,m not convinced
Hoover just takes his place back on the  bench. You,ll likely see both  go.
The Rams still give up a good  bit of yardage on the ground lately averaging
127 yards per game over the last  four weeks. That ranks them #  24. For
the year, they rank # 23  in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.

J.R.  Redmond (NE) vs Chief Defense The Patriots are a tough team to
figure and coach Bill Belichick is starting to remind me of Captain Queeg
rolling the marbles while his crew forms a mutiny. But if he can hold them
together, I,ve  got to think Redmond has a pretty good matchup here. The
Chiefs rank # 23 over the past four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per game.
For the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.
Keep  an eye on QB Drew Bledsoe as if he can,t go, all bets are off but if
he can keep  the defense honest, I like Redmond,s chances here. Of course,
you have to know the risks  that Belichick could decide to go with Patrick
Pass or Kevin Faulk at a moments  notice if Redmond looks at him the wrong
way(



Edgerrin James (Ind) vs  Jets Defense The NFL is the ultimate game of
watching to see what others do. You  can bet the Colts are aware of the
success Chicago,s James Allen had last week  rushing (and fumbling) the ball
against New York. I think you,ll see a steady diet of  Edgerrin doing the
same thing (hopefully not fumbling though) James is a no brainer ) start
him  against virtually any team unless you,re so loaded at RB it,s not
fair.

Eddie George (Ten) vs  Eagle Defense Philadelphia isn,t quite as tough  vs
the run as their reputation might have you believe. Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 21  in rushing yards allowed  per game. For the  year,
they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB. But you  can
pretty much throw those numbers out when it,s Eddie George. He,ll get his
yards the hard way. I,d be very surprised if you don,t see  George exhibit
some leadership here and put together a solid  effort.



Curtis Martin (NYJ) vs Colts  Defense It sounds like Curtis Martin is  just
going to have to play with the strained buttocks. (you,ve heard enough jokes
by now, I,ll  spare you) The Indy defense is  definitely vulnerable to the
rush.  For the season, they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points allowed to the
opposing  RBs. This game will be in New York  and the Colts are soft when it,
s cold outside so Martin could have an  edge.

James Allen (Chi) vs Green  Bay Let,s give Allen the benefit of  the doubt
and say the THREE fumbles Sunday were rain induced. (although I didn,t see
Curtis Martin  fumble three times and he was there too()  If he can find the
handle on the ball, he,ll be fine as he actually ran  very while when he
managed to hang on to the football. Green Bay proved Monday night they can,
t  stop much of anything and this could be a nice opportunity for the Bears
and for  Allen.



Even Matchups: These games feature no real advantage  either way

Travis Prentice / Jamel White (Cle) vs  Jaguar Defense  This is one of
those games that may not play in reality the way it looks on paper.
Jacksonville has yielded an average of  120 yards rushing per game over the
last four weeks. That ranks them # 20. They also rank # 20 for the year in
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RBs. But they,re playing better than
that now  I believe. And the Browns are just  playing out the season. And
the  bigger issue is Travis Prentice is fighting for playing time as Jamel
White has  looked impressive. It,s a decent  matchup for Cleveland but I,d
probably shy from these guys if it were  me.

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Bengal  Defense A case of both sides being better
than what many people think.  Michael Pittman is a player.  Since Vince
Tobin left, it,s been pretty much Pittman,s show on the  ground much to the
chagrin of Thomas Jones owners. And on the other side of the ball, the
Bengals are a better defense than they get credit for. On the ground, they
rank # 17 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. For
the year, they rank # 10 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.  So
this once could truly go either way. I,d feel ok with Pittman if he was my
guy but I wouldn,t be overly excited.

Robert Smith (Min) vs Lion  Defense This isn,t the best matchup in the
world for Smith but you have to start him.  If nothing else than to get an
early lead on your opponent with a  Thursday night game. C,mon, that,s
worth something( Seriously, Smith  is one of the elite RBs right now but
Detroit is playing pretty tough against  the run ranking # 15 in rushing
yards allowed per game over the last four  weeks. He,s a starter though,
just  play him.

Ahman Green (GB) vs Bear  Defense Find a nice toasty place to watch  this
one. Chicago in December. At night. That,s football. With Dorsey Levens
likely gone for the  year, the Packers are looking to Green to be the Man.
Chicago has a tough run defense led by  all world rookie Brian Urlacher. I
told you this Summer my cab driver in Chicago was calling him &Vanilla
Freak8  and now you,re seeing why. I love  this kid. These guys are
professionals but I can promise you Green thinks about the hard hitting guy
with  the wild eyes lined up across the way from him as the temperature
keeps  dropping.

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Bills  Defense Smith practiced Wednesday and while it,
s  awful early to make a definitive call, it looks like he,ll start Sunday.
The Bufallo defense is solid against the  rush. They rank # 13 in rushing
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. Although for the year, they
rank # 5 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.  Although if Smith
can return to his awesome form before the injury, he,ll  be a load. The
Dolphins will rely  on the running game with Jay Fiedler likely rusty plus
not that good to begin  with.

Marshall Faulk (StL) vs Panther  Defense Let,s hope Faulk gets back to his
old form. And let,s hope the  Panther defense gets back more their old
rushing defense form. Over the last four games, Carolina ranks  # 12 in
rushing yards allowed per game.  But for the year, they come in at # 25 in
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB. It sounds to me like  coach Mike
Martz won,t make the mistake again of underutilizing one of his best  weapons
in Faulk.



Downside Matchups: These  games favor the Defense

Shawn Bryson / Sammy Morris / Antowain  Smith (Buf) vs Miami Defense
Believe it or not, the Dolphin  Defense ranks just # 16 in rushing yards
allowed per game over the last four  weeks. Granted, 3 of those games  don,t
factor MLB Zach Thomas but that number is still higher than I would have
thought. The Bills rushing game is  a mess. The team is calling Morris,
ankle questionable so we,ll have to wait and see. Bryson has done very
little with the  opportunity and we know Smith didn,t produce or we would
have never seen so much  of Bryson and Morris. With a  healthy Zach Thomas,
I,d probably shy a bit from any of these guys.

Emmitt Smith (Dal) vs Buccaneer  Defense Emmitt Smith said he,d never been
knocked out in his career but that,s what happened Thursday. He,s bounced
back quickly and says he,ll  certainly be the starter Sunday.  The Bucs are
tough but not invincible. Over the last four weeks, they rank # 11  in
rushing yards allowed per game giving up 95 yards per game on the  ground.
Emmitt,s made a living  running the ball against tough defenses over his
career so I,m not overly  concerned with the matchup. He,s a  gamer and I,d
say he,s probably a starter for most owners this week even facing  Tampa Bay.



Stephen Davis (Was) vs Giants  Defense  Be very leery  here. Stephen Davis
demonstrated  last week that you have to take what he says with a grain of
salt. Players are notoriously optimistic about  their chances for recovering
from injury.  Unless I could turn my lineup in very late this week and I was
sure he,d  start, I,d think very hard about going elsewhere this week. It,s
not like he,s facing Seattle and  this is a dream matchup or something.  The
Giants are tough against the run ranking # 2 for the year in Fantasy  Points
allowed to the opposing RB. So unless you know for sure he,s going,  I,d
strongly consider my other options.

Terrell Fletcher (SD) vs 49er  Defense Fletcher is probable with a rib
fracture which must sound worse than it is. Either that or he,s one tough
guy. The problem is that San Francisco is  playing much improved defense
lately.  Against the rush over the last four weeks, they rank # 9 in rushing
yards  allowed per game. That,s a marked  contrast to their year long
numbers where they rank # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.
Adding  Fletcher,s ribs to the improved Defense, I don,t see much from San
Diego on the  ground Sunday.

Ron Dayne / Tiki Barber (NYG) vs  Redskins  To me, Barber is  looking much
more favorable in this game simply based on the opinion I don,t see  New York
taking a lead where they can grind out the clock. If you,re a Dayne owner,
you,re  painfully aware that coach Jim Fassel puts Dayne on the shelf in
favor of Barber  when his team trails. The Giants  are a good team but I don,
t see them jumping all over Washington. Plus, the Redskins play very good
rush  defense. For the year, they rank #  4 in Fantasy Points allowed to the
opposing RB and over the last four weeks,  they rank # 8 in rushing yards
allowed per game.

James Stewart (Det) vs Viking  Defense Stewart,s great game against Tampa
Bay taught me not to discount him too much based on matchups but he,s got a
surprisingly tough situation here.  Minnesota over the last four weeks ranks
# 7 in rushing yards allowed per  game. For the year, they rank # 14  in
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB. Part of that has to do with the
Vikings  explosive offense which throws team into passing mode to catch up
but part of it  is that the Vikings are just improved there. LB Dwayne Rudd
should miss the game with  a bad shoulder so that favors Detroit but I,m
still not overly excited about the  matchup. Still though, Stewart is  one
of the better backs and I,d think he,s likely a starter for your team unless
you,re loaded with RBs.





Defensive Slam Dunks: These games heavily favor the  Defense

Darnell  Autry / Stanley Pritchett (Phi) vs Titan Defense  The Eagle RBs
have been very little factor and I don,t see them all of a  sudden emerging
against a very tough Tennessee defense. Especially one in a foul mood after
another last second loss from the kicker.  It,s a tough job, but QB Donovan
McNabb carries this team almost solely  on his shoulders. He could be the
teams leading rusher again as Tennessee puts the clamps on the RBs. For the
year, the Titans rank # 6  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.

Mike Anderson (Den) vs Saints  Defense I like Mike Anderson and he,s a
great story but he,s got a very tough matchup this week with New Orleans.
The Saints rank # 3 for the year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing
RB and over the last four games, they  rank # 5 in rushing yards allowed per
game. They,ve just averaged 81 yards per game  allowed rushing. Anderson is
still  probably worth a start unless you,re really deep at RB but just be
aware he,s  facing a tough defense.

Charlie Garner (SF) vs Charger  Defense With a week off to prepare, Garner
comes back to face a rejuvenated Charger team coming off their first
victory. They,re playing rush  defense like we,re accustomed to seeing from
San Diego ranking # 4 in rushing  yards allowed per game over the last four
weeks. Garner isn,t your normal back but he,s  facing a tough game here. I,
d still  start him as he,s got that big play potential with the ability to go
the  distance at any time, but I,m not excited about the  matchup.

Jerome Bettis (Pit) vs Raider  Defense Jerome Bettis was built for
grinding down defenses in the December cold but he,ll have a tough matchup
this  week against Oakland. The Raiders  rank # 2 over the last four weeks
in rushing yards allowed per game. That,s partly why their passing defense
is so bad: teams can,t run so they go to the air. I like Bettis and I think
he,ll be able  to grind out some yards at home but this is clearly a
difficult matchup  here.

Jerald Moore / Chad Morton (NO) vs  Bronco Defense Assuming Moore is ok
with his neck  stinger, he,ll be running behind his outstanding OL but this
is a tough matchup  against the Denver Defense that,s remained tough vs the
run. Over the last four weeks, they rank # 3  in rushing yards allowed per
game allowing an average of 74 yards per game. Ricky Watters and Seattle
only managed  to post 85 against them Sunday.  Moore looks to get the
majority of carries and goalline work so he,s the  better option at this
point assuming he can go. But even healthy, he,s got his work cut  out for
him.
