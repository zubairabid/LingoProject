If, at any time, it is necessary for anyone in Enron Government Affairs- The
Americas  to contact elected or appointed officials (or staff) of the Federal
Government ,e.g;FERC, FCC, CFTC, State Department, Congress, The White House
etc.., you must  make every effort to  to contact someone from the Federal
Government Affairs( now also includes Federal RegulatoryAffairs) group in the
DC office before any such  contact is made.The purpose of this memo is not
to discourage or prohibit individuals in the group  from calling their
contacts in Washington, but rather to make sure we are fully coordinated and
are speaking with one voice.Thanks in advance for your full cooperation.
