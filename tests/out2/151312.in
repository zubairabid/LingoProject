Gerald,

We were approached before the holidays by First Union representing Universal
Compression to potentially serve as a back-up fleet manager for a large
portion of their fleet that they are trying to take off balance sheet (via
First Union) should they become insolvent.  They are trying to do this
simultaneously with the close of the merger with Weatherford.  Mark and I met
with the CEO (Steve Schneider) and CFO (Ernie Danner) prior to the holidays
to discuss this a little further as well as a broader alliance between Enron
and Universal to chase electric horsepower deals.   Universal is comfortable
with Enron having somebody like Hanover as a back-up to be called upon should
Enron be called to fulfill it's role and even with a spread, so long as
Hanover does not "see" Universal and vice-versa.  Suggested stand-by fee of
$150,000-$200,000/yr. has been casually thrown out.  Please review the
attached document and let's discuss further - perhaps tomorrow morning.  I
talked with Steve Schneider yesterday and he told me that Ernie Danner would
be getting with me today regarding a confidentiality agreement regarding this
deal as well as a potential marketing alliance, which we would like to
discuss further with you as well.  Give me a call when you get a chance and
we'll set something up.

Thanks,
Chris
