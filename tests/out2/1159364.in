Jeff, Bill,

I received a call today from Elsa Villareal on the Texas Desk and confirmed
with OGE's credit that due to the weather, wells have been shut in in
Oklahoma and they are calling Force Majore on one of their Interruptable
contracts to ENA (Sitara #495794).  I have been assured by OGE all firm gas
transactions will continue to flow, only this one transaction will be
effected.  The transaction calls for 15,000 mmbtu/day and is being cut down
to 7,500/day through Saturday.
