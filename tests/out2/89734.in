BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
East Power Group
The East Power Group is off to another strong start in 2001.  The realignment
of the group into regional business units with joint trading, mid-marketing,
and origination operations has proven to be a catalyst for deal flow,
producing both a high volume of transactions and high value.  More
transactions were executed in January than any month last year, including one
deal that will bring tremendous strategic value to Enron as well.
Executed in January, was the purchase of two 35 MW coal-fired cogeneration
facilities located in southeastern North Carolina.  ENA will supply steam to
the industrial host, Alamac Knit Fabrics, and will sell power into the
merchant market.  The plants are inside Carolina Power & Light's service
territory, which is connected to AEP, Virginia Power, Duke, SCEG and SCPSA.
These plants are the first purely merchant facilities in North Carolina.
This deal exemplifies how Enron leverages its talent in that originators from
the East Power Group and Industrial Markets Group joined forces to bring this
deal to execution.  They also leveraged the Global Markets group to manage
the coal supply and emissions issues.
Prospects going forward look promising as a number of high value transactions
are in the pipeline.  Of particular note is The Sandhill Power Project, a 180
MW peaking facility currently under construction in Austin.  The facility is
scheduled to come online in June, in time for the advent of deregulation in
Texas. The joint venture, between EPMI and Austin Energy, will provide both
trading groups with a highly flexible asset, enabling them to access
real-time volatility while hedging existing obligations.
Additionally, the Fort Pierce (Florida) City Council voted 5 to 0 in favor of
Enron's proposal to repower the Ft. Pierce Utilities Authority's (FPUA)
existing power plant in that city.  Our proposed 180 MW facility will be used
to produce steam to power the H.D. King facility at approximately 20 percent
less cost than FPUA can produce it.  According to FPUA officials, this
reduction in cost may lead to reduced rates for their ratepayers.  The
planned in-service date is summer of 2002.

all types of industry, market, regulatory, analytical, and financial

Another major development is the adoption of a customer information
