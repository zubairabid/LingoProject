FYI,
Bill Bradford in Credit had a conference call today with the Deutsche Bank
Credit person and I think we have come to agreement on not adding any
specified entities to the ISDA Master Agreement.  He also discussed  proposed
credit limits for the three other Deutsche Bank masters we want to get in
place (including EnronCredit.com).  I think we are done now and hope to get
execution documents from them, since the documents are on their system.  Our
intention is to then get Deutsche Bank to turn around 3 like masters, making
any changes necessitated by change of law, and otherwise turn around the
remaining masters quickly.  I'll keep you posted.
