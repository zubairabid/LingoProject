Mark,

I now attach a copy of an-email showing my amendments to the revised IT
documentation which I have received from the OMLX.

Two points:-

1.  Do you have any comments on the OMLX's amendments (see below) (in my view
their amendments take into account everything we wanted except per my
revisions in my e-mail to Susan Gill below)  or my additional amendments?

2.  Have you yet heard from Houston IT / Telecoms Dept with any issues on the
technical specs etc in the IT Licence documentation?  This is the only side
of things which can now hold this up.

Kind regards

Mark
