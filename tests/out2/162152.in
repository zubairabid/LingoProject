EES Closes Sony Electronics Deal: EES just closed a fixed-price commodity
deal with San Diego,s largest energy user, Sony Electronics, Inc. Sony is
just one of many deals that closed in August through the collaborative
efforts of the Market Development group. The objective of the group is to
streamline processes and procedures to close more commodity deals faster.
Market Development, Origination, Commodity Structuring, Risk Management,
Account Implementation Planning (AIP), Legal, and Regulatory Affairs joined
forces to create an easy-to-close scenario for the California markets. A
daily executable price sheet and ready-to-use short form contract are
products that were developed from this effort. EES Market Development scored
their first hits in San Diego last month. Four additional deals that have
recently closed include Burlington Coat Factory, WW San Diego Harbor Island*
Travel Lodge, Martin Furniture, and La Jolla Pharmaceuticals. Congratulations
to the deal team and to Market Development. Click on link to learn who was

Enron Building Services Takes on 100 New Employees from Springs: As part of
our agreement with Springs Industries, Springs has contracted with Enron
Building Services for facilities management work that includes the operation
of Springs, in-house power plants as well as their heating and
air-conditioning systems. About 100 workers at Springs will be assumed by
Enron Building Services. Springs reported that this is part of a continuing
effort to bring a higher level of expertise to their mechanical
infrastructure. Springs spokesman Ted Matthews stated that &Springs is
proficient in making home fashions and sheets, but doesn,t have experience in
running power plants.8

Skilling Makes Plea for FERC to Control Monopoly Transmission System Abuses:
Enron President and COO Jeffrey Skilling told a National Press Club
conference in Washington, D.C., that &the U.S. wholesale market for
electricity is the most screwed up8 of all the deregulating markets in which
Enron participates globally. Skilling urged the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to use its influence to ensure open access to the nation,s
transmission grid. According to Skilling, Enron,s attempts to schedule power
transactions have often been denied because of &alleged capacity shortages,8
yet transmission-owning utilities turn around and use the requested capacity
for their own generation facilities to move power along the same route.
Skilling pointed to the fact that access to the transmission grid is hindered
by barriers controlled by monopolies, stating &We need some very strong
action to ensure that the system is open and that people can get power from
places where it is available to places where it is needed.8 Skilling, who
went on to say that the solution would be for FERC to eliminate inconsistency
in the application of market rules to participants and ensure that the
transmission system is opened up and nondiscriminatory. Click on link to read

Some Interesting Facts: Peak demand for electricity has risen 11 percent in
the U.S. since 1995, while reserve margins for excess power capacity dropped
14 percent since 1997. Instances of so called transmission loading reliefs*or
system failures*have soared 300 percent since 1998.

California Update: Two electric utilities, Southern California Edison (SCE)
and Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), who serve 90 percent of Californians,
want to renege on the deregulation deal from 1996 that prevents SCE and PG&E
from passing high electricity costs onto their customers until 2002. Last
week, SCE and PG&E lobbied unsuccessfully to pass legislation that would have
allowed them to add a surcharge to consumer bills from 2002 to 2006. Instead,
the legislature passed a relief bill last week for the states,s smallest
utility, San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E). Through the law, which imposes
rate freezes in San Diego, SDG&E consumers and state taxpayers are expected
to repay the higher prices over time, including interest. PG&E has paid $2
billion from May through June for higher electricity prices without passing
those costs to its users. That amount is expected to rise to many more
billions until the rate ends, if prices stay at high levels. Wholesale prices
have soared to 25 cents a KWh, which calculates into five times the six cents
a KWh charged just a year ago.
