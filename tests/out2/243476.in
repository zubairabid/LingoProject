Let's Talk About...
Building a Resume  - The Resume Builder from Yahoo! Careers creates up to
five professionally formatted, public or private resumes. These online
resumes are smart enough to keep their format when downloaded, printed,
emailed, or posted.

Sponsored Sites  - Have you seen one of the new yellow-bordered "Sponsored"
boxes yet? Commercial web sites already listed in the Yahoo! Directory pay
for a prime spot in their specific categories -- these are businesses that
want to stand out from the crowd.

Managing Your Auctions  - The Seller's Manager is a free desktop tool that
saves time and money by helping you manage your auctions more efficiently.
Create multiple auctions while you're offline, then upload easily with one
click of the mouse. Stay tuned for more great Yahoo! Auctions enhancements.

Tips & Tricks


Tired of all that typing when you place an order on Yahoo! Shopping? Set up
a Wallet to store your payment information in a single secure place. Checkout
is faster than ever. Use your Wallet for plane tickets, hotel rooms, auction
sales, or a bigger mailbox.

Send your favorite snapshots as online greeting cards. Once you've created a
private Photo Album, it's a cinch to turn family photos into snazzy greeting
cards. Enclose a voice message for a truly personal touch.
