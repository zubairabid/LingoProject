Information Management Weekly Milestones Report ) 1/26/01



Portal.
Business Analyst presented IM Survey Results Report to technical team.
Report shows what Business Units/Functional Units need to access from a
portal.

Based on BA report, technical team is developing a prototype portal to show
the User Experience team for &look and feel8 input.

Monty Myers joined the task force to represent portal development efforts
for EES.  Challenges to access corp driven information from EES have been
identified.

myhome.enron.com targeted as choice portal name.

Kathy Schultea will handle Andrea Yowman,s responsibilities for portal
security development.

Unstructured Data Management/Enterprise Search Engine tool.
The three competing products are Autonomy, Verity and Inktomi.  The
Software Selection Team met with Autonomy and Verity last week.  Inktomi is
being consulted via phone.

The SST is currently reviewing and completing the evaluation criteria
matrix using input from the three vendors being considered.  The matrix
results indicate the vendors have similar offerings.  We may need to pilot
all three vendors.

The SST plans to get quotes on software prices from all three vendors.  GSS
has been consulted.

BP Amoco was contacted to gain their perspective on Autonomy.  BP,s
application of Autonomy appears to be similar to what Enron desires.  The
Autonomy project has been in progress at BP since March 2000.  The
implementation has not been smooth.  Three other BP contacts were suggested
for additional testimony.  BP concluded Autonomy was an immature product.
Every challenge encountered resulted in Autonomy bringing in consultants to
develop patch solutions to resolve.  On a side note, BP uses a product from
Addept Software (UK) that serves the same function as what is envisioned with
Expert Finder.  More details on how this product is used will follow.

EES is looking to purchase Verity.  Azurix is already using Verity.  EBS
has agreed to purchase/pilot Autonomy.

Enron London had a negative experience piloting Autonomy.

The UDM/ESE tool of choice needs to respect existing authority for
confidentiality. Each vendor,s product is being tested for confidentiality
and  security.

Steve Kean is scheduled to attend the February 7th IM Task Force Meeting.
The Task Force will present the IM Strategy proposal and the  recommendation
to appoint an executive coordinator for IM ASAP.  Similar to Rick Causey,s
