Jake is ready to tell Lee who the purchaser is and get permission to "tell
all".  I think that's a good way to go.
I have to confess that I didn't look at their comments to the turbine
contract.  I will be glad to do it if you want.  Jake said that Bill Williams
had some discussions with Delta, and he thought maybe some of their comments
were no longer germane.  Bill has received their comments, but I don't know
his reaction.
