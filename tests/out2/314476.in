Brian,
I'm not sure I understand their objection to the wording about the guaranty.
Do you think that there is going to be a problem with them accepting the
Mitsui guaranty? I don't know what the arrangements are with Mitsui, and
perhaps there isn't a real issue due to how this is being handled in the EPC
contracts.
My understanding is that Peggy will be giving legal sign off on these
agreements for ENA.
