Sara,
Per my conversation with Sheila on yesterday and my review of our files, we
only have an agreement in place for ENA.   We still need to review the
Agreement for Prime Brokerage Clearance Services in order to get an agreement
in place for ECT Investments, Inc.
I will provide Stephanie with a copy of the executed agreement between
Deutsche Bank (f/k/a BT Alex Brown Incorporated) and ENA so that she can
forward it to Jason along with their new form of Agreement for Prime
Prokerage Clearance Services.
