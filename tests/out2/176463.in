FCC Expands ILEC Line-Sharing Mandates To Fiber Loops, Confirms
Line-Splitting Duty

The FCC has given data CLECs (competitive local exchange carriers) a major
win by expanding incum-bent local exchange carriers' "line-sharing" and "
line-splitting" duties.  The FCC tinkered with its rules governing those
duties in an order and further notice of proposed rulemaking released in
Common Carrier dockets 96-98 and 98-147.  The order addressed petitions for
reconsideration and clarification of a previous order on line sharing (TR,
Nov. 22, 1999).

Line sharing is the requirement that incumbent local exchange carriers
(ILECs) allow competitors to offer high-speed service over the high-frequency
portion of a loop, while the ILEC continues to offer voice service over the
low-frequency portion.

In the order adopted Jan. 19, the FCC said ILECs must provide line sharing
over the entire loop even if they've deployed fiber in the loop to supplement
or replace the original copper line.  The order was one of many actions that
the FCC took on the last day of Chairman William E. Kennard's tenure but that
were not immediately available, eventually trickling out of the Commission
last week.

Rhythms NetConnections, Inc., had filed a petition for clarification with the
FCC, complaining that some ILECs were contending they didn't have to unbundle
fiber portions of the loop when those portions were used to provide xDSL
(digital subscriber line) services.

"In the absence of this clarification, a competitive LEC might undertake to
collocate a DSLAM [digital subscriber line access multiplexer] in an
incumbent's central office to provide line-shared xDSL services to customers,
only to be told by the incumbent that it was migrating those customers to
fiber-fed facilities," the FCC said.  In that case, the CLEC would have to
collocate another DSLAM in a remote terminal to continue offering line-shared
services to the same customers.

"All indications are that fiber deployment by incumbent LECs is increasing
and that collocation by competitive LECs at remote terminals is likely to be
costly, time-consuming, and often unavailable," the FCC said.

The FCC says ILECs must allow for "line splitting," so competitors that offer
voice service using the unbundled network element platform can provide-or
partner with another data CLEC to provide-DSL service on those same lines.

"Incumbent LECs are required to make all necessary network modifications to
facilitate line splitting, including providing nondiscriminatory access to
[operation support systems] necessary for preordering, ordering,
provisioning, maintenance and repair, and billing for loops used in
line-splitting arrangements," the FCC said.

The FCC "strongly urged" ILECs and CLECs to "work together to develop
processes and systems to support competing carriers' ordering and
provisioning of unbundled loops and switching necessary for line splitting."

The FCC, however, denied a related petition for clarification filed by AT&T
Corp.  It had asked the FCC to require ILECs to make their xDSL services
available to customers even if they obtain voice service from competing
carriers using the ILECs' lines.  AT&T was worried that customers wouldn't
switch their voice service to a competitor if that change would eliminate
their ability to get DSL services.

"Although the line-sharing order obligates incumbent LECs to make the
high-frequency portion of the loop separately available to competing carriers
on loops where incumbent LECs provide voice service, it does not require that
they provide xDSL service when they are no longer the voice provider," the
FCC said.

"To the extent that AT&T believes that specific incumbent behavior constrains
competition in a manner inconsistent with the Commission's line-sharing rules
and/or the [Communications Act of 1934, as amended] itself, we encourage AT&T
to pursue enforcement action," it said.

The FCC also denied requests from Bell Atlantic Corp. (now Verizon
Communications, Inc.).  It had asked the FCC to (1) reconsider the
requirement that ILECs refusing to condition a loop for the provision of DSL
service demonstrate to the relevant state commission that conditioning that
loop would degrade voice services and(2) permit a line-sharing deployment
schedule other than the one it adopted.

Rhythms applauded the FCC's decision.  "By expanding the definition of line
sharing to include fiber loops and ensuring our ability to use consumers'
existing voice lines for data services, we can bring the benefits of the most
robust broadband service offerings to consumers," said Jeffrey Blumenfeld,
chief legal officer and general counsel for Rhythms.

During a press briefing last week (see separate story), Thomas J. Tauke,
senior vice president-public policy and external affairs at Verizon
Communications, Inc., criticized the FCC's decision, specifically the
provisions requiring line splitting.  The FCC "didn't address how this is to
be done," he said.

Jonathan Lee, vice president-regulatory affairs at the Competitive
Telecommunications Association, said the order was an "unmitigated win" for
data CLECs.  But he said the FCC's decision not to grant AT&T's petition for
clarification was "regrettable."

Residential consumers who have DSL available only from the ILEC won't be able
to switch their voice service without losing their DSL service, he said.  Mr.
Lee compared the ILECs' "tying" of voice and DSL service to Microsoft Corp.'s
practice of linking its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows
operating system.  The ILEC practice "could run afoul of antitrust laws," he
said.

Critics Worry White House `E-rate' Proposal May Reduce Funding, Discourage
Participation

The education reform package that President Bush sent to Congress last week
is drawing criticism from policy-makers who helped draft and implement the "
E-rate" telecom discount program.  It's also sparking concern among schools
and libraries that have participated in the program and benefited from it.

They're worried that the president's E-rate proposal, if adopted in its
current "blueprint" form, would discourage certain schools from applying for
discounts on telecom and Internet services and internal connections.  In the
long run, they fear that the president's proposal would lead to decreased
funding for the program, which currently stands at $2.25 billion a year.

The main problem, these critics say, is that shifting administration of the
program to the Department of Education, as President Bush has said he intends
to do, would render E-rate funding dependent on congressional
appropriations.  In its current form under the FCC's oversight, the program
is funded by universal service contributions assessed from telecom carriers.

The technology part of the president's education reform initiative unveiled
last week calls for combining the E-rate with several Department of Education
programs to form one "performance-based technology grant program."  Then, it
says, funding for that program would be disbursed "by formula" to states
through block grants.

The aim is to streamline the many "duplicative technology programs" into one
education grant plan, the Bush administration says.  Such streamlining would
go a long way toward reducing the E-rate program's "burdensome paperwork"
requirements and adding more flexibility to those program, the proposal says.

"Flexibility will be increased by allowing funds to be used for purposes that
include software purchases and development, wiring and technology
infrastructure, and teacher training in the use of technology," it states.
It also would permit E-rate recipients to use federal funds to pay for
Internet filtering software, which is being mandated for the first time this
year by the Children's Internet Protection Support Act of 2000 (TR, Jan. 22).

But key U.S. lawmakers and education officials aren't prepared to embrace the
plan yet.  They say more details are needed from the Bush administration on
several issues, including how the E-rate program would be funded and what
formula would be used to distribute money among the states.

Jeff Burnett, director-government relations at the National Association of
Independent Schools, says the language of the proposal is cloudy when it
comes to whether the program would be supported by the Universal Service
Fund, as it is now, or by general tax revenues.  "That's a huge question
mark, and we are highly nervous about it because it does appear that it would
become part of the Department of Education's budget," he says.

Mr. Burnett says making the E-rate dependent on general tax revenues could "
destabilize" its funding and discourage some private and parochial schools
from applying for telecom discounts.  "It would go from where it is now, a
pretty stable $2.25 billion per year, to where you would have arguments every
year in Congress over how much money it would get."

Plus, he says, E-rate funds "no longer would be string-free" if they were to
be allocated by the federal government.  Moving the program to the Department
of Education could discourage religious schools from participating because of
potential "church-state problems," he says, referring to the First Amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, which prohibits congressional establishment of an
official religion.  And some states may be restricted by their state
constitutions from providing federally funded educational services to private
and religious schools, he adds.

Former FCC Chairman Reed E. Hundt, who oversaw the implementation of the
E-rate program back in 1996, fears that the end result could be the "killing
of the program altogether" or a "chopping of it down from a significant
program to an insignificant one."

Having the Education Department oversee the E-rate program would remove
stability from the program, Mr. Hundt stressed.  "Where are they going to
find 2, 3, or 4 billion dollars in the general [tax revenues] to pay for it?"
he asked.  "The bigger [telecom service] providers probably would be happy,
but the [support] would be reduced," Mr. Hundt told TR last week.

He also rejected the administration's claims that consolidating the education
technology programs would reduce applicants' paperwork and filing
requirements.  "Moving it to the Department of Education is not a way to
simplify paperwork," Mr. Hundt said.  "Nothing is simpler than the way it's
done now.  These forms don't even go to the government; they go to a
privately run trust fund," he added.

A source who works with schools on fine-tuning their E-rate applications
foresees a "food fight at the state level" if the Bush administration
institutes a block-grant program.  "There won't be the same spirit of
cooperation among the schools and libraries that there is today," the source
says.  "Instead, they'll see each other as competition."

A library official said that even if the E-rate program remained part of the
USF, expanding its scope to include software purchases and teacher training
could give telecom carriers grounds for a legal challenge of the assessments
made on their revenues.  "If the money is to come from the service provider,
then the program must directly relate back to the services that they
provide.  I could see someone challenging the software and teacher-training
aspects," the source says.

Snowe, Rockefeller Are Skeptical

The program has received an icy response from two U.S. senators who were
among the original sponsors of the legislation that added the E-rate
provisions to the Telecommunications Act of 1996:  Republican Olympia J.
Snowe (Maine) and Democrat John D. Rockefeller IV (W.Va.).

In a statement issued soon after the Bush education proposal was released
Jan. 23, Sen. Rockefeller vowed to "aggressively fight" the E-rate aspects of
the proposal.  It would be a "grave mistake" to fold the E-rate into a block
grant program with the Education Department technology programs, Sen.
Rockefeller said.

"Under the Bush block-grant approach, local schools would have less
flexibility, not more," Sen. Rockefeller said.  "Private and parochial
schools would have to negotiate with state education agencies and worry about
entanglements of federal regulations.  Most importantly, the secure funding
for the E-rate and investments in technology would be jeopardized," he said.

Sen. Snowe also worries about turning the E-rate into a block-grant program.
Among other things, she says, such a proposal could deter private and
parochial schools from participating in the program.

"We plan to work with President Bush and our colleagues in the Congress to
ensure that the current program is protected, as we don't support any efforts
that would undermine its goals," a Snowe aide told TR.

New House telecommunications subcommittee Chairman Fred Upton (R., Mich.) has
told President Bush in a letter that he plans to hold several hearings this
year on "aspects of your proposal that fall under the subcommittee's
jurisdiction," including the E-rate plan.

Rep. Upton has asked the Bush administration to focus on broadband service
deployment, "particularly as it relates to how increased access to high-speed
data services in our homes and schools could vastly improve educational
opportunities."  Numerous calls to the White House seeking comment weren't
returned before TR's Friday afternoon news deadline.

FCC Gears Up To Enforce E-rate 'Net-Filter Mandate

The FCC wants advice on how to implement the Children's Internet Protection
Act of 2000 (CIPA), which requires schools and libraries that receive "
E-rate" discounts for Internet services and internal connections to use "
filtering" technology that prevents minors from accessing "harmful" material
over the 'Net.

The FCC has suggested that recipients certify compliance with the CIPA on
forms they must file when applying for E-rate discounts on telecom services,
Internet services, and internal connections.

Under the CIPA, the "Internet safety technology" must filter out "visual
depictions" of "obscene" material or "child pornography," even when adults
are using the computers.  Schools and libraries are required to bar access to
visual depictions that are "harmful to minors" only when minors are using the
computers.

The law requires E-rate recipients to certify each program year that they are
complying with the filtering mandate and that they monitor the operation of
the filtering technology while the computers are in use.  The law allows an
administrator to disable the filtering technology while the computer is being
used by an adult "for bona fide research or other lawful purpose."

Schools and libraries have one year to adopt an Internet safety policy; in
the first year after the effective date of the law, they either must certify
that they have such a policy or that they are developing one.

The law also allows schools and libraries to seek a waiver from the FCC
during the law's second year, if state or local procurement rules or
competitive bidding requirements have prevented them from implementing an
Internet safety policy.

The FCC's further notice of proposed rulemaking released last week in Common
Carrier docket 96-45 proposes that E-rate recipients this year certify either
that they have complied with all relevant provisions of the CIPA or that the
CIPA requirements don't apply.  The certifications would appear on their "
receipt of confirmation" forms (FCC Form 486).

The CIPA doesn't require schools and libraries that use E-rate funds only for
telecom services-and not for Internet access or internal connections-to
install the filtering technology.

The FCC proposes that in future years recipients include their compliance
certifications on FCC Form 471, which is used to describe the services to be
funded.  It asks how to implement the "remedial" provisions of the CIPA,
which detail ways an applicant can correct its noncompliance or
noncertification.  Comments are due 15 days after publication of the
rulemaking notice in the Federal Register; replies are due 30 days later.

The American Library Association has announced plans to challenge the
constitutionality of the CIPA (TR, Jan. 22), whose Internet-filtering
requirements extend to other federal programs that subsidize schools' and
libraries' purchases of computers and Internet access.

The ALA, which notes that the CIPA takes effect April 20, has launched a Web
site where it will post information about its activities regarding the CIPA
(http://www.ala.org/cipa).

Meanwhile, President Bush last week announced a proposal for modifying the
E-rate program, including reducing the paperwork demands on applicants (see
separate story).

Large Carriers Want 700 MHz Auction Postponed, But Small Providers,
Broadcasters Oppose Delay

Large wireless carriers are once again asking the FCC to postpone the
scheduled auction of licenses for the 700 megahertz band, citing a host of
familiar concerns that they say could dampen enthusiasm for bidding on the
frequencies.

But rural carriers and TV broadcasters are urging the Commission to begin the
auction March 6, as scheduled, noting that the sale already has been
postponed three times.  They say that large carriers have had plenty of time
to prepare for the auction and that further delays would be unfair to them.

They offered their views in comments filed with the FCC last week in response
to a request by Verizon Wireless to delay the sale until September (TR, Jan.
22).  Several large carriers that supported the request asked for an even
longer postponement.

Supporters of postponement cited the presence of broadcasters in the spectrum
and the need to negotiate band-clearing agreements as evidence to support
their cause (see separate story).  Most of their arguments echoed those of
Verizon Wireless.

TV broadcasters don't have to evacuate the spectrum (channels 60-69) as part
of the transition to digital TV until 2006 at the earliest.  But wireless
carriers, citing the uncertainty about when the frequencies slated to be
auctioned will be available for use, have asked the FCC and Congress to force
the broadcasters out early.

In addition to the presence of the broadcasters, other reasons the large
carriers said the auction should be delayed included concerns that (1)a
reauction of "C" and "F" block PCS (personal communications service) licenses
hadn't finished in time for carriers to assess their spectrum needs in the
700 MHz auction (see separate story), (2)companies need more time to prepare
for package bidding rules that will be used for the first time in the auction
(TR, July 10, 2000), and (3)a high-level effort to identify and allocate
frequencies for third-generation (3G) services will affect carriers' interest
in the 700 MHz band (see separate story).

The Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Associationsaid carriers
interested in participating in the 700 MHz band auction wouldn't have time to
assess their bidding strategies and spectrum needs and form alliances because
the C and F block reauction concluded last week, after the comments were
filed.  In addition, the Commission's anticollusion rules limit contact
between bidders, CTIA noted.

CTIA added that prospective 700 MHz band bidders wouldn't have time to
negotiate the band-clearing agreements the FCC is encouraging.  And it cited
carriers' need to prepare for package-bidding rules.  In the end, the same
factors that led the FCC to delay the auction last year still exist, CTIA
said.

AT&T Wireless Services, Inc.,asked the FCC to delay the auction until March
2002.  Such a move "will give incumbents, prospective bidders, and the
Commission an opportunity to resolve much of the uncertainty associated with
this band," the carrier said.  AT&T Wireless also said more time was needed
to assess whether recent FCC actions designed to speed broadcasters'
transition to digital TV would accomplish their goals.

It suggested that the FCC schedule the auction of channels 60-69 in
conjunction with a sale of channels 52-59, which the FCC is statutorily
required to license by September 2002.

Cingular Wireless LLCasked the FCC to delay the auction until at least 60 to
90 days after it acts on all "long form" applications filed by winning
bidders in the C and F block reauction.  It also suggested that FCC
coordinate the timing of licensing channels 60-69 and channels 52-59.

Nextel Communications, Inc.,wants the auction delayed until November.  That
move would give carriers time to assess the spectrum-allocation decisions
made under the 3G initiative, Nextel said.  Although the 30 MHz of commercial
spectrum in the 700 MHz band is not under consideration as part of that
effort, the frequencies are considered ideally suited for such advanced
services.

Telephone and Data Systems, Inc.,filing on behalf of itself and its United
States Cellular Corp.subsidiary, supported a delay until September or later
if several other related proceedings aren't completed.

A postponement is "essential" for smaller and midsize companies that need
time to assess 700 MHz market valuations, to locate funding sources, and to
prepare for the package-bidding methodology, TDS said.

"In July of 2000, the Commission postponed this very auction for precisely
these same reasons, a decision strongly supported by the wireless industry,"
said Motorola, Inc."The logic of that postponement should apply with equal
force to the present request by Verizon."

It added "that forcing carriers to engage in competitive bidding for spectrum
without adequate preparation will itself create a market distortion both in
the actual process and in the rapidly evolving mobile marketplace."

The Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-Internationalsaid
it backed a postponement "to the extent that such a delay may facilitate the
ultimate clearing of television broadcasters from the 700 MHz band. . .Any
effort that facilitates band-clearing on channels 60-69 is likely to benefit
public safety agencies waiting to use the 700 MHz band."

Spectrum Exchange Group LLCsought a delay of two to six months, saying such
an action would strike "the appropriate balance between the needs of the
bidders and incumbent broadcasters to establish a band-clearing agreement,
and the urgency of putting this valuable spectrum to its best use."

Ronald M. Harstad and Michael H. Rothkopfof Rutgers University and Aleksandar
Pekecof Duke University also argued for a delay, citing the 3G initiative,
the need to negotiate band-clearing agreements, and the introduction of
package bidding.

Rural Carriers, Broadcasters Object

But a group representing rural carriers urged the FCC to hold the auction as
scheduled.  "The Commission should not establish auction deadlines that
comport with the business plans of any private company," the Rural
Telecommunications Groupsaid.  "And, stripped to its essence, Verizon urges
the Commission to delay the 700 MHz [band] auction merely for Verizon's
business convenience."

Delaying the sale would benefit Verizon Wireless at the expense of
competitors that skipped the C and F block reauction with the expectation of
bidding in the 700 MHz band sale, the group said.  It added that it opposed
any linkage between the 700 MHz band auction and the initiative to allocate
3G spectrum.

"This informal daisy chain between auctions-and between auctions and other
allocation proceedings-can only serve to advantage the largest carriers who
seek to participate seriatim in each and every auction," it said.

Paxson Communications Corp.,the largest incumbent broadcaster in channels 60-
69, also asked the FCC to reject the postponement request.  Further delay "is
unfair to incumbent broadcasters who are seeking to get past the auction and
determine the future availability of this spectrum for both their digital and
analog operations," it said.

The broadcaster added that wireless carriers had plenty of time to prepare
for the sale.  And it noted that the FCC already had missed a September 2000
statutory deadline for depositing proceeds from the sale into the U.S.
Treasury.  Equity Broadcasting Corp.said it supported Paxson's comments.

"Further delay will slow the digital transition, violate congressional
directive, and will not benefit potential bidders for the spectrum," agreed
Shop At Home Network."Moreover, Verizon's arguments that a further delay will
benefit it and other potential auction participants are specious at best."

FCC Takes Additional Steps To Help Clear 700 MHz Band

The FCC has taken additional steps to help spur the relocation of incumbent
TV broadcasters from the 700 megahertz band in order to make way for wireless
carriers.  But it said it wouldn't force the incumbents to clear the
frequencies-at least not yet.

In a third report and order released last week, the Commission said it had
decided to allow the private sector to determine what band-clearing
mechanisms best suited the needs of broadcasters and wireless carriers.

Specifically, the FCC has decided not to impose cost-sharing rules, cost
caps, or cost-recovery guidelines at this time on the relocation of incumbent
broadcasters.  Last year the agency asked whether it should impose such rules
(TR, June 26 and July 10, 2000).

`Secondary Auctions' Touted

The FCC also will leave it up to industry to decide if "secondary auctions"
should be organized to facilitate band-clearing agreements before the
auction, which is scheduled to begin March 6.  The FCC earlier asked for
comments on whether it had the authority to conduct such auctions.

In the order released last week, the FCC reiterated its view of the benefits
of such auctions, saying they "have potential to offer both broadcasters and
new entrants additional opportunities to reduce the potential transaction
costs of negotiating with each other directly after the auction."

As part of their transition to digital TV (DTV), broadcasters don't have to
leave the 700 MHz band (channels 60-69) until 2006 at the earliest.  They may
stay longer if less than 85% of households in their markets have access to
DTV signals.  That timetable has created uncertainty among wireless carriers
about how much to bid-or whether to bid at all-on the spectrum when it is
auctioned.

Wireless carriers have asked the FCC to force TV broadcasters out of the
spectrum before they are required to leave (TR, Aug. 21, 2000).  For their
part, broadcasters have fought such band-clearing mandates and instead have
urged the FCC to address larger issues related to the DTV transition,
especially digital "must-carry" cable TV rights.

The FCC recently took several actions that it said would facilitate
broadcasters' transition to DTV, including those dealing with must-carry
rights.

In its 700 MHz band order, the FCC said it wanted to give voluntary
mechanisms a chance in clearing the frequencies for wireless services.  "We
believe that voluntary agreements between broadcasters and licensees should
result in the effective clearing of the 700 MHz band," it said.  "However, we
will revisit this issue in the future if we find it necessary."

The FCC's latest action builds upon the policies it adopted last year to
provide guidance to broadcasters and carriers regarding the regulatory
treatment of private band-clearing agreements.

For example, the agency extended to three-way agreements a general "
rebuttable presumption" adopted last year for bilateral pacts.  The
presumption is that such agreements are in the public interest.

The FCC also provided guidance on interference issues arising from relocation
agreements that involve moving a broadcaster to a channel below channel 59.
And it has streamlined the review of band-clearing agreements and affirmed
that it expeditiously will process band-clearing agreements.  It also
clarified that voluntary agreements to temporarily relocate licensees into
channels 52-58 would be permitted.

Commissioner Gloria Tristani dissented in part from the report and order.  In
a statement, she said she opposed the decision to extend the rebuttable
presumption to three-way agreements.  She expressed concern that such
agreements would result in a loss of TV service for viewers and said she
wanted to consider band-clearing agreements case by case.

"As I have stated previously, my ultimate concern is that the presumption in
favor of band clearing reflects a diminishing regard for the public value of
free, over-the-air television services," Commissioner Tristani said.

She also took exception with the FCC's statement that it might revisit issues
surrounding the mandatory relocation of broadcasters.  "I remain convinced
that such action would contravene the statute" establishing broadcasters' DTV
transition, she said.

The FCC's order was adopted Jan. 18 in Wireless Telecommunications docket
99-168, Cable Services docket 98-120, and Mass Media docket 00-39.  A news
release on the action and the text of the document were released Jan. 23.

Kennard Requests Hard Stand

In a related development, former FCC Chairman William E. Kennard has asked
Congress to take a hard stand against broadcasters in their transition to
DTV.  Writing Jan. 19 to Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D., S.C.), Mr. Kennard
suggested that Congress set a firm deadline of Dec. 31, 2006, for TV
broadcasters in channels 52-69 to relocate.

He also proposed that broadcasters using channels 2-51 after that date be
charged an escalating fee to encourage them to clear the spectrum.

Writing Jan. 26 to Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee
Chairman John McCain (R., Ariz.), Lyle Gallagher, president of the
Association of Public-Safety Communications Officials-International,
expressed support for Mr. Kennard's proposals to help clear the 700 MHz band.

At the very least, steps should be taken to clear channels 60-69, Mr.
Gallagher said.  Public safety agencies urgently need access to 24 MHz of
spectrum in the 700 MHz band that the FCC has reallocated for their use, he
said, but much of it is occupied by broadcasters.

"By making the Dec. 31, 2006, date firm for channels 60-69, state and local
governments throughout the nation could plan on spectrum being available no
later than Jan. 1, 2007, and could proceed with necessary funding, frequency
planning, design, and construction for new radio systems," he added.  "APCO
also supports adoption of legislative and regulatory provisions that may
allow for clearing of channels 60-69 even prior to 2006."

The FCC's Enforcement Bureau is a proposing a monetary forfeiture...

The FCC's Enforcement Bureau is a proposing a monetary forfeitureof $5,000
against Verizon Southwest, Inc., for operating a paging station in Juno,
Texas, without Commission authorization.  Verizon told the agency that it
operated the station without authorization between Nov. 1, 1998, and Feb. 7,
2000.  The bureau released a notice of apparent liability for forfeiture
against Verizon Jan. 25 in file no. EB-00-TS-212.

Easing Spectrum Crunch Tops CTIA's 2001 Lobbying Agenda

Spectrum issues will top the wireless industry's Washington agenda for this
year, according to Cellular Telecommunications & Internet Association
President and Chief Executive Officer Thomas E. Wheeler.  A scarcity in
frequencies is hurting U.S. carriers' competitiveness with their foreign
counterparts and thwarting development of the wireless Internet, he said.

Mr. Wheeler urged the FCC to lift the cap on how much spectrum a carrier may
hold in any one market while a high-level effort to identify and allocate
frequencies for third-generation (3G) services proceeded.  Such a move would
ease the spectrum crunch, he reasoned.

At a briefing for reporters last week, he said the Bush administration had
its work cut out for it in collaborating with the FCC to find suitable bands
for 3G use.

U.S. Seen Falling Behind

"God bless the Clinton administration for starting the spectrum policy review
process, but [it] couldn't bring it to fruition, and it now falls to the Bush
administration to deal with the really hard parts and to make decisions," Mr.
Wheeler said.

"Those decisions will probably take time.  We can't afford time.  It's what
we don't have.  Japan and Europe are already building the [networks while] we'
re still trying to figure out where we should get it," he added.

Then-President Clinton launched the 3G initiative by executive memorandum in
October 2000 (TR, Oct. 16, Nov. 6, and Nov. 20, 2000; and Jan. 8 and 22).
The memorandum calls for the FCC to license the spectrum by Sept. 30, 2002,
after a collaborative effort led by the FCC and the Commerce Department's
National Telecommunications & Information Administration.

But a key obstacle is that the bands being examined most closely for 3G
applications already are occupied by military, commercial, and educational
users.

Mr. Wheeler said that the time it would take to allocate 3G spectrum made it
even more important for the FCC to lift the spectrum cap immediately.  The
FCC asked for comments on the issue last week (see separate story).

He said he had "some very profitable discussions" with Bush transition team
officials on spectrum issues, although he wouldn't elaborate.  He also said
he was pleased that Donald L. Evans stressed the importance of allocating 3G
spectrum in his Senate confirmation hearing for secretary of commerce earlier
this month (TR, Jan. 8).

Mr. Wheeler said another key issue for the coming year was finding ways to
use wireless technologies to bridge the "digital divide."  He stressed that
the gap wouldn't "be bridged by just pumping more money into existing subsidy
programs," although he said changes in the universal service program were
needed.

On other issues, Mr. Wheeler said CTIA also hoped there would be
congressional or FCC action on Internet privacy, "calling-party-pays" billing
arrangements, and reciprocal compensation.  Regarding privacy, he said the
trade group had gotten a positive response from members of Congress and
regulators to its proposed principles for location-information services (TR,
Oct. 30 and Nov. 27, 2000).

Mr. Wheeler defended the industry's claims regarding the safety of mobile
phones.  A new book by George L. Carlo, a scientist who led a seven-year, $27
million industry-funded initiative to study the issue, says the wireless
industry has downplayed evidence that the phones can cause illness (TR, Dec.
25, 2000).  The book is particularly critical of Mr. Wheeler.  The industry
also has suffered recent setbacks in pending court cases that claim mobile
phones are dangerous to humans (TR, Jan. 22).

"I don't think that the issue is George Carlo or Tom Wheeler or CTIA," Mr.
Wheeler said.  "The whole issue is, What's the science? . . .We've supported
independent science and will continue to support independent science."

As for litigation, he said that lawsuits alleging a link between exposure to
radio frequency emissions and health effects such as cancer had been
dismissed in the past.

Nextel Communications, Inc., has agreed to purchase specialized mobile
radio(SMR) licenses from Arch Wireless, Inc., for $175 million and invest $75
million in the paging carrier.  In exchange, Nextel will receive a new series
of Arch preferred stock.  The two companies also will explore ways to
collaborate on marketing.  Arch said it didn't expect to need the SMR
spectrum because of upgrades to its two-way messaging network.  Nextel said
the transition would give it about 20 megahertz of SMR spectrum in the 800
and 900 MHz bands in 52 of the top 100 U.S. markets.

Commission Examines Merits Of Lifting CMRS Spectrum Cap

The FCC is reexamining whether to lift its cap on the amount of spectrum
wireless carriers may hold in any one market.  The Commission also is
considering whether it should eliminate its cellular cross-interest rule.

In a notice of proposed rulemaking released last week, the FCC asked for
comments on whether the spectrum cap should be retained, modified, or
eliminated to comply with the public-interest standard set forth in section
11 of the Communications Act, as amended.

Specifically, the agency is soliciting views on whether "meaningful economic
competition" in the commercial mobile radio service (CMRS) market has
rendered spectrum aggregation limits, including the cellular cross-interest
rule, unnecessary.

Under the agency's rules, carriers aren't allowed to hold more than 45
megahertz of spectrum in urban markets and 55 MHz in rural markets.  The
cellular cross-interest rule restricts an entity's ownership interest in
cellular carriers operating in the same market.  The FCC wants to know
whether those limits are still needed to prevent harmful concentration of
spectrum holdings or ensure opportunities for new players to enter the market.

The Commission is asking for comments on what constitutes "meaningful
economic competition" under section 11 and how competitive conditions have
changed since it last reviewed the restrictions in 1999.

In the largest metropolitan areas, where seven in 10 Americans live, at least
five mobile telephone carriers are offering service, the agency noted last
week.  As a result, it said, prices are declining, coverage areas are
expanding, and new service packages are being offered.  It wants to know if
there are public-interest reasons for maintaining the cap regardless of such
competitive developments.

Large wireless carriers have lobbied the FCC to lift the cap, saying it has
thwarted the U.S. wireless industry's deployment of third-generation (3G)
services, placing it at a disadvantage with foreign competitors.  Some
smaller carriers, however, have asked the FCC to retain the cap, saying it's
needed to ensure that they remain competitive against their larger
counterparts.

In a broad review of the cap conducted in 1999, the FCC decided to retain the
restriction, although it eased the limit in rural markets (TR, Sept. 20,
1999).  At the time, it concluded that the cap was a safeguard against
excessive concentration in the CMRS market, preserving competition and the
consumer benefits it had produced.  It also determined in 1999 that the
cellular cross-interest restriction was necessary to protect competition.
The agency eased the rules somewhat, however, permitting some degree of
cross-interest.

In November 2000, the FCC denied two petitions for reconsideration of its
1999 decision but said it would reexamine the cap as part of its 2000
biennial review (TR, Nov. 13, 2000).  The notice of proposed rulemaking,
adopted Jan. 19 and released Jan. 23 in Wireless Telecommunications docket
01-14, stems from that review.  Comments are due 60 days after the notice's
publication in the Federal Register, and replies are due 30 days after that.

In a separate statement, Commissioner Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth said that he
supported the rulemaking notice but that he tentatively would have concluded
that the cap should be lifted.

"The use of a spectrum cap is a drastic regulatory remedy that continues to
search for a corresponding competitive ill," he said.  "I have grown
impatient with the Commission's repeated reexaminations of these issues
without substantial alterations in our policy approach."

Industry Praises Review

Thomas E. Wheeler, president and chief executive officer of the Cellular
Telecommunications & Internet Association, said that lifting the cap was
crucial while a high-level effort to identify and allocate 3G bands winds
through the regulatory process (see separate story).

Mr. Wheeler told reporters at a luncheon last week that such access to
additional spectrum was necessary for the U.S. to maintain its leadership in
the development of the Internet as it moves to wireless devices.

Japan and European countries have moved more quickly to allocate frequencies
for 3G services, setting aside twice as much spectrum as the U.S. has, he
said.

The Personal Communications Industry Association, however, has said the cap
is necessary to give smaller carriers a chance to enter the CMRS market.

Mr. Wheeler noted that newly named FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell had said he
would favor lifting the spectrum cap.  "Clearly in some of the opinions that
he's written in the spectrum proceeding, he's asked the question, Why should
this continue?" Mr. Wheeler said.  "We're hopeful."

Then-Commissioner Powell voted to retain the cap in November 2000 but said he
tended to agree with Commissioner Furchtgott-Roth's conclusion that the cap "
has outlived its usefulness."

Notice Explores Alternatives

In its rulemaking notice, the FCC seeks comments on alternatives to lifting
the spectrum cap entirely or leaving it untouched.  For example, it asks
whether it should apply the cap only to spectrum used for voice services.  It
also asks whether it should retain the cap in markets where there is less
competition and eliminate it in other markets where more carriers are
offering service.

The FCC also solicits opinions on whether to treat already-licensed spectrum
differently from frequencies licensed in the future.  "As a general matter,
we believe that newly available CMRS-suitable spectrum either should be
excluded from the spectrum cap, or, if it is included, that the cap should be
adjusted accordingly," the Commission said.

The FCC also wants opinions on how eliminating or relaxing the cap would
affect its authority to review license-transfer requests under section 310(d)
of the Act.  If it makes such changes to the cap, it wants to know whether it
could or should "incorporate other methods" into its license-transfer review
to prevent consolidations "that would eliminate the benefits brought by
competition."

It also seeks comments on whether removing the cap would place more of a
burden on the FCC and industry in the review of license transfers.

If the Commission decides to keep the spectrum cap for now, it wants to know
what further market developments could make the cap unnecessary and whether
it should set a "sunset" date for the restrictions.

Regarding the cellular cross-interest rule, the FCC asked whether the
restriction was still necessary to prevent cellular carriers from merging in
markets where there is little or no other competition.

Appellate Court Upholds Nextel Tower Permit

A Pennsylvania state court has upheld a local zoning board's decision to let
Nextel Communications, Inc., build a communications tower under a special
exemption provision for radio transmitters.  Residents opposing the tower had
argued that the entire 150-foot structure didn't qualify as a transmitter.

The opinion, written by Commonwealth Court President Judge Joseph T. Doyle,
affirmed a trial court decision that upheld the action of the Newlin Township
Zoning Board.

The township's zoning ordinance limits the types of buildings that can be
constructed but allows the board to grant a special exemption to authorize
the construction of a "radio or television transmitter."  But the ordinance
doesn't define radio transmitter.

The residents asserted that the "radio transmitter component of the facility
is but a minor element" and said the tower "falls far outside any commonly
understood definition of radio transmitter."  They argued that because the
tower didn't fit into that or any other category, the zoning ordinance didn't
permit it to be constructed within the township.

Judge Doyle ruled that the record supported the board's decision. The judge
noted that testimony by a Nextel engineer demonstrated that the tower was an
integral part of the facility.  He concluded that the "entire system operates
together in order to transmit the necessary information for the cellular
network to function."

Senior Judge William J. Lederer and Judge Bonnie B. Leadbetter joined Judge
Doyle's opinion in Robert and Loren Pearson v. Zoning Hearing Board of Newlin
Township and Nextel Communications of the Mid Atlantic, Inc. (case no. 3182).

Finance Panel Senators Back Broadband Service Tax Credits

Former New York Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D.) may have retired, but his
push to extend tax credits to carriers that deploy high-speed Internet
facilities is being revived by key Democrats and Republicans who control the
congressional purse strings.  Its proponents also have asked President Bush
to include the measure in his initial budget submission to Congress.

On Jan. 23, Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV (D., W.Va.) led a bipartisan group of
more than 30 U.S. senators-including freshman Hillary Rodham Clinton (D.,
N.Y.), who won the seat left vacant by Sen. Moynihan-to introduce the
Broadband Internet Access Act (S 88).  A companion bill is expected to be
introduced in the House Ways and Means Committee this week by committee
members Philip English (R., Pa.) and Robert T. Matsui (D., Calif.)

The Senate bill is a slightly altered version of Sen. Moynihan's legislation
of the same name, which almost cleared the Senate last fall as part of the "
New Markets" tax-break package (TR, June 12 and Oct. 2, 2000).

"This bill represents my commitment to making sure that no community is left
behind in the technology revolution," Sen. Rockefeller said in a statement.
The bill "will ensure that communities everywhere, whether rural or urban,
will have the tools necessary to compete in the global economy," he
continued.  Added Sen. John F. Kerry (D., Mass.), a co-sponsor: "Too many
businesses are shying away from areas where broadband access is either too
expensive or unavailable, and underserved areas are put at a tremendous
disadvantage."

Like the Moynihan plan, the new bill would provide a tax credit equal to 10%
of a carrier's investment in equipment used to provide "current-generation
broadband" services to business or residential customers in rural and
low-income areas.  It defines current-generation broadband services as
services that can transmit at least 1.5 megabits per second downstream (to
the subscriber) and at least 200 kilobits per second upstream (from the
subscriber).

Carriers also could claim a tax credit equal to 20% of a carrier's investment
in equipment used to deploy "next-generation" broadband services to "all
residential customers," according to Sen. Rockefeller.  His bill defines
next-generation services as those able to transmit at least 22 Mbps
downstream and at least 5 Mbps upstream.  A Rockefeller aide said the
upstream transmission requirements were lower than those in last year's bill
because lawmakers "didn't want to cut out any potentially good broadband
suppliers, like wireless and satellite providers."

Because the measure would amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, it has
been referred to the Senate Finance Committee, where several of its members
are co-sponsors, including Sens. Rockefeller and Kerry, Minority Leader
Thomas A. Daschle (D., S.D.), Finance Committee ranking Democrat Max Baucus
(Mont.), Orrin G. Hatch (R., Utah), Olympia J. Snowe (R., Maine), Blanche L.
Lincoln (D., Ark.), and Kent Conrad (D., N.D.).

"It is crucial that we act quickly," the lawmakers said in a Jan. 22 letter
to President Bush.  "A number of other nations, including China, Japan,
Sweden, and Singapore, are moving aggressively to surpass the U.S. in
broadband infrastructure over the next five years."

The proposed Broadband Internet Access Act "is a truly bipartisan measure,"
they told the president.  "Clearly, such support indicates a general
recognition of the need to extend a high-speed information system to all
Americans.  This legislation provides the vehicle for delivering such a
system, and we hope you will support it in your upcoming budget proposal,"
they said.

The support of Republicans Hatch and Snowe is important because they give the
bill much-needed bipartisan support on the Finance Committee, something it
didn't have last session, the Rockefeller aide said.  "We're hopeful" that
new Finance Committee Chairman Charles E. Grassley (R., Iowa) will allow the
measure to come up for a committee vote.  Calls to Sen. Grassley's office
were not returned by TR's deadline.

Meanwhile, one day later, Sen. Kerry introduced a portion of the broadband
tax-credit bill as a separate, stand-alone measure.  His bill, S 150, would
authorize a tax credit equal to 10% of a carrier's investment in equipment
used to provide current-generation broadband services to underserved areas.
But it wouldn't provide tax credits for investments to deliver those services
to rural areas, nor would it provide added tax credits for delivering
next-generation services.

A Kerry aide said the senator crafted the separate bill to attract more
attention to the lack of high-speed deployment to low-income communities.  "
That's the area he's most concerned with," the aide told TR.

Verizon Wants Law Changing Approach to Broadband Regs

The "time is ripe" for legislation creating a new regulatory regime for
broadband services and networks, similar to the regime that governs the
wireless industry, according to Verizon Communications, Inc.  Such an
approach would entail "no economic regulation and minimal rules," and states
would be preempted from regulating broadband services.

Meeting with reporters in Washington Jan. 25, Verizon executives said recent
court decisions had made it more important for Congress to develop a new
regime for such services.

Thomas J. Tauke, Verizon senior vice president-federal government relations,
said representatives of incumbent telephone companies, cable TV providers,
and telecom equipment providers had discussed with each other the need for
new broadband legislation.

"There has been no organized effort" by the industry segments to coordinate
lobbying efforts, Mr. Tauke said.  "But it's fair to say there's been a lot
of discussion among the players."

Recent court decisions on the appropriate regulatory regime for cable modem
services (TR, April 17, May 22, and June 26, 2000) have troubled the cable TV
industry by suggesting that they could be considered telecom services, Mr.
Tauke said.

He also cited the recent federal appeals court decision overturning the FCC's
regime for advanced services affiliates (TR, Jan. 15).  The court rejected
the FCC's finding that incumbent local exchange carriers could avoid
unbundling and resale mandates for their digital subscriber line offerings if
they provided those services through a separate affiliate.

"This court case really highlighted the point that the FCC doesn't have the
ability to come up with, on its own, a new regulatory structure covering
broadband services," Mr. Tauke said.

Mr. Tauke said the Freedom and Broadband Deployment Act drafted last year by
Reps. W.J. (Billy) Tauzin (R., La.) and John Dingell (D., Mich.) would have
provided a "little bit" of the regulatory reform sought by Verizon.  But Mr.
Tauke said he hoped lawmakers would "look at it in somewhat broader terms"
this time around.

Mr. Tauke suggested that this type of broadband legislation had become
Verizon's top priority and that its push for legislation to allow Bells to
offer interLATA (local access and transport area) data services was becoming
less so.

Asked if interLATA data relief was still the most important legislative issue
to Verizon, Mr. Tauke said, "It certainly would have been two years ago.  Is
that the most important thing now?  It's certainly important. . .But of equal
importance, if not more importance, is getting some clarity on the broadband
world."

Verizon still is pushing for legislation to change the existing reciprocal
compensation regime.  Edward D. Young III, SVP-federal government relations,
said payments to compensate competitive local exchange carriers for
terminating calls to Internet service providers ran Verizon about $1 billion
a year.

Although the FCC has been promising to act on the reciprocal compensation
issue, Congress may need to step in, Mr. Young said.  "The FCC is still
trying to work through the issue, but obviously it's a different dynamic"
given the change in chairmen from William E. Kennard to Michael K. Powell, he
added.

Mr. Tauke said it was "shameful" that the FCC hadn't resolved the issue.  "
Two years ago they knew there was a problem, but they didn't have the courage
to preempt the states," he said.  "They could see the problems coming, but
they thought it would work itself out."

Joan H. Smith, chairwoman of the National Association of Regulatory Utility
Commissioners' telecommunications committee and a member of the Oregon Public
Utility Commission, said she was "puzzled" by the bid to preempt state
regulators in a new broadband regulatory regime.  "We don't regulate
broadband" services, she told TR.  "Our biggest issue at the state level is
promoting broadband [deployment], not regulating it."

Utah Bill Would Halt Plan To Merge Consumer Agencies

Legislators in Utah have passed a measure to repeal a year-old law that would
have folded together two state agencies that represent utility customer
interests before the Public Service Commission.  Absent the repeal measure,
the legislation passed in 2000 would have combined the Committee of Consumer
Services and the Division of Public Utilities, effective July 1.  The new
entity would have been called the Office of Public Advocate.

House Majority Whip David Ure (R.), who sponsored last year's restructuring
legislation, also was behind the bill to repeal it.  The legislative staff
said he'd decided that the time wasn't right to overhaul the state's utility
regulatory system.  The repeal measure sped through the Utah Legislature last
week, progressing from its first House reading through passage by both houses
in just two days.

Rep. Ure rejected alternative proposals for re-structuring the state's
regulatory agencies, settling for a straight repeal of last year's
legislation.  One proposal would have expanded the PSC's membership, the
legislative staff told TR.

Another version that circulated between the end of last year's legislative
session and the beginning of this year's would have merged the PSC and the
Division of Public Utilities.

The staff said Rep. Ure pulled those drafts after deciding that the state's
regulatory structure shouldn't be altered in the midst of the current energy
crisis.

The Division of Public Utilities is charged with representing the public
interest before the PSC and ensuring that all utility customers have access
to safe, reliable service at reasonable prices.  The Committee of Consumer
Services represents residential, small- business, and agricultural consumers
before the PSC.  Some parties had expressed concern that merging the two
entities would decrease the amount of information available for PSC decision
making.

Consumer group opposition last year persuaded Gov. Michael O. Leavitt (R.) to
call for a review of the law after the legislative session ended in March.
He allowed the bill to become law last year without signing it.

Reps. Cannon, Eshoo Unveil Internet Privacy Measure

Reps. Chris Cannon (R., Utah) and Anna G. Eshoo (D., Calif.) have introduced
a bill to require operators of commercial Web sites that collect personally
identifiable information to explain to site visitors what information is
collected, how it will be used, and who is collecting it.  The proposed
Consumer Internet Privacy Act (HR 237) would authorize the Federal Trade
Commission to assess civil penalties of up to $22,000 per violation, or a
total of $500,000 against a particular violator.

Rep. Cannon said the bill was a good starting point for addressing Internet
privacy, a topic that many observers see as the top Internet-related issue in
the 107th Congress.

"We are going to rely heavily on the marketplace to help define how to
implement the guidelines established in this bill's language, just as the
market has commendably worked with government officials to develop other
standards and seals for privacy," Rep. Cannon said.

Rep. Eshoo, who said consumers shouldn't have to "reveal their life story
every time they surf the Web," said their privacy must be protected without
impeding the free flow of information on the Internet.  "This legislation
achieves that goal-the bill doesn't regulate the Internet; it empowers the
consumer," Silicon Valley Democrat Eshoo said last week.

The measure also would require Web site operators to give users an
opportunity to limit the use and disclosure of their personal information for
marketing purposes in a "clear," "conspicuous," and easily executed manner,
the legislators said in a press release.

Appeals Court Says FCC Erred in Rejecting U S WEST Bid for `Nondominant'
Regulation

A federal appeals court agrees with former U S WEST Communications, Inc. (now
Qwest Corp.) that the FCC erred by focusing on the company's market share
when considering its request to be freed from "dominant"-carrier regulation
of certain services.

The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington last week remanded to the FCC a 1999
order rejecting a U S WEST request to forbear from applying such regulation
to the company's special-access and high-capacity dedicated transport
offerings in the Phoenix and Seattle metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs).
In the 1999 order, the FCC said U S WEST could refile its request for relief
under a separate deregulatory regime it had set up to allow incumbent telcos
to seek pricing flexibility for some services (TR, Nov. 29, 1999).

Chief Judge Harry Edwards wrote the Jan. 23 decision in AT&T Corp. v.
FCC(consolidated cases beginning at 99-1535).  He was joined by Judges David
Sentelle and A. Raymond Randolph.

The court found that the FCC failed to conduct its review of U S WEST's
request in compliance with section 10 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
which directs the FCC to forbear from applying regulations deemed no longer
necessary.

The court explained that the FCC's order "rests solely on the view that,
because U S WEST offered no reliable data on market share, the petition for
forbearance failed to make a prima facie showing that sufficient competition
existed to satisfy section 10."

But in relying so heavily on market-share data, the FCC "departed from its
traditional nondominance analysis without explanation," the court said.  The
FCC's decision to rely on that data "may well be reasonable, but until the
Commission has adequately explained the basis for this conclusion, it has not
discharged its statutory obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act,"
the court said.

In the past, the FCC had "gone so far as to view market share as irrelevant
where there was other evidence that a carrier lacked market power," the court
said.

"Were this the first time the FCC was asked to consider whether a carrier was
dominant in a given market, the explanation provided by the Commission in the
forbearance order may well have been accurate," it said.  "But it is not the
first time that the Commission has addressed this issue."

The court said it might be "reasonable" for the FCC to demand a showing on
market share in every inquiry on dominant regulation.  But it is "not
reasonable for the Commission to announce such a policy without providing a
satisfactory explanation for embarking on this course when it has not
followed such a policy in the past," it said.

Court Nixes IXCs' Claims

As was apparent during oral arguments (TR, Dec. 4, 2000), the court was
unconvinced by the arguments of AT&T and WorldCom, Inc., which had challenged
the order to the extent that it granted U S WEST pricing flexibility for some
services.

In the forbearance order, the FCC stated that it granted the relief requested
"to the extent that the pricing flexibility order establishes a framework
pursuant to which [Bell operating company] petitioners may obtain relief by
demonstrating satisfaction of the competitive triggers adopted in that order."

The court rejected the AT&T and WorldCom petitions to overturn the pricing
flexibility "relief," saying their argument "borders on being disingenuous."

"When the forbearance order is read in its entirety, it is absolutely clear
that U S WEST was granted no relief whatsoever," the court said.  "U S WEST
sought forbearance, and it was categorically denied."  The FCC simply "
reminded" U S WEST that it was eligible to apply for pricing flexibility
under the regime for reviewing such requests, the court said.

The court added, however, that the FCC couldn't use its pricing flexibility
rules as a substitute for its statutory mandate to consider requests for
forbearance.

"Congress has established section 10 as a viable and independent means of
seeking forbearance," the court said.  "The Commission has no authority to
sweep it away by mere reference to another, very different, regulatory
mechanism."

FCC Gives Bells `Blueprint' In OK of SWBT's InterLATA Bid

The FCC's authorization for Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. to offer
interLATA (local access and transport area) services in Kansas and Oklahoma
could offer insights to other Bell companies planning their own interLATA
service bids-especially for rural states.  In granting SWBT's application,
the FCC marked some clear guideposts it will use for evaluating future bids,
including issues relating to late-filed data and other procedural matters.

In an order adopted unanimously Jan. 19 and released Jan. 22 in Common
Carrier docket 00-217, the FCC doubled the number of states in which Bell
companies are permitted to provide in-region interLATA services.  In an
unprecedented move, the FCC delayed the effectiveness of its decision for 43
days.

Under section 271 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the FCC must
determine that a Bell company has met a 14-point "checklist" of
market-opening mandates in a given state before authorizing it to provide
interLATA services there.  The FCC must consult with the U.S. Department of
Justice and th
