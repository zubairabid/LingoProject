With respect to the referenced List:
1.  Ameren Services Company-OK to shut down powe & SO2, as per Credit's
direction
2.  Oglethorpe Power Corporation-they are specifically being opened to trade
power, however, our records do not show them as having a FERC license.  If
they really want to trade power we are going to need a name and phone # to
contact them & get evidence of their FERC license.
3.  Ameren Energy, Inc.-we cannot currently open them up until we investigate
more this agency thing.  It doesn't mean we're shutting them down forever, we
just need more info.
