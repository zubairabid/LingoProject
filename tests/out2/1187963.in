Here is a summary of various conversations over the last couple of days
between the recipients of this email and what I believe has now been agreed.
If I have missed anything, please let me know.

- Frank Davis (PCG) will issue a PA report on a daily basis, which will
highlight new PA's which have been received.
- Debbie Brackett (Credit) will review the list, ensure that the correct
corporate entity is identified and fill out the credit profile.
- Credit will generate a profile matrix, which they will send to:
- Each of the existing legal contacts, with cc: Tana Jones
- Global Contracts (Karen Lambert)
- Global Counterparty (Samuel Schott)
- Tana, Karen and Samuel will be responsible for collecting the feedback from
within their respective departments and forwarding to Frank Davis
- Frank will collate the three inputs, produce a master profile and update
Tax.

The above procedure shall still be completed within 72 hours.
