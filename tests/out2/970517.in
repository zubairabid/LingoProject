December 12, 2000

INSIDE WASHINGTON

The Week Ahead*

***Congress is poised to finish FY2001 appropriation bills and conclude the
106th Congress this week.
***FERC meets tomorrow, and is expected to issue a final rule on the market
interventions for California's ailing electricity market.  Other important
cases on the agenda include Illinois Powers' withdrawal from the Midwest ISO.

FEDERAL AFFAIRS

***Commission Approves CA-ISO Request For $250 Soft Price Cap***

FERC late last week approved a price cap change requested by the California
Independent System Operator (ISO), in response to the emergency conditions in
the California electricity market.  The current purchase price cap of $250
per Mwh will be lifted, and bids above that amount will be allowed but will
not set the clearing price paid to all sellers, as does the current purchase
price cap.  FERC notes this should attract more bids and alleviate supply
shortages.  Parties bidding above $250 will be required to report their bids
to FERC on a weekly basis and provide cost information.

FERC also authorized the ISO to penalize participating generators that
refusal to operate in response to an ISO request in an emergency.

MERGERS & ACQUISITIONS

***Constellation Energy Group Subsidiary Purchases Nine Mile Point Nuclear
Plants***

Constellation Energy Group announced plans to purchase 100 percent of Nine
Mile Point Unit 1 and 82 percent of Unit 2 for $815 million.  Constellation
would then own a total of 1,550 megawatts of Nine Mile Point's 1,757
megawatts of total generating capacity.  The sale is expected to close in

recently announced plans to separate its wholesale merchant energy and retail
energy businesses into two stand-alone, publicly traded companies.
Constellation also announced that their merchant energy business was ranked
fifth in the nation for sales of electric power in the third quarter of 2000.

***Cinergy Affiliate To Acquire Two Merchant Generating Plants From Enron***

Cinergy Corporation has announced that Cinergy Capital & Trading, a
non-regulated affiliate, has signed a definitive agreement to purchase two
natural gas-fired merchant electric generating facilities located in the
Southeastern United States.   The acquisition consists of Enron's
494-megawatt Brownsville generation facility located in Tennessee, and the
504-megawatt Caledonia generation facility in Mississippi.  The transaction
will increase Cinergy's generation portfolio to about 21,000 megawatts, with
the non-regulated portion being about 15,000 megawatts.  "Cinergy has created
a regional leadership position in the Midwest power market and is focused on
strategic opportunities to expand our footprint," said Michael Cyrus,
president of Cinergy Capital & Trading.  He noted that the transaction
increases the non-regulated generating capacity "in excess of 30 percent in
just over a year."

project will be completed in two phases.  Phase 1 will consist of a
320-megawatt simple-cycle peaking facility scheduled to be in service next
