Here are my corrections/concerns/questions about the EPMI portion of the
filing.

We need to coordinate this with PGE and Enron Wind and make sure they file to
revise their tariffs and agree to the change of the code of conduct.  Are you
handling that Sarah or do you want me to?
The filing and tariff do not include the Commission approved FTR sales into
California, that needs to be added.
Do we have any idea how close the SEC is to ruling?  It's my recollection
that FERC does not like indefinite notice periods, as we have requested, nor,
under their rules, do they permit a notice period of longer than 120 days.
Has counsel looked at whether FERC has made special exceptions for mergers?
