Hi Karolina,

Yes, it might be more productive to talk on the phone.  Given our time
difference, why don't we plan on tomorrow (Friday) 8:00AM PDT, 4:00PM BDT?  My
number in the states is 503-464-8430.  Give me your number, too, so that I can
call back if I get hung up in a meeting or something.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the marginal cost is set by the
capacity increment of a plant that is on the margin in a particular hour, but
in constructing the stack, increments of a plant may be scattered throughout
the stack, based on their respective incremental heat rates.  (This is why
increment heat rates must be strictly increasing in this model.)  Results for
the capacity increments, however, are not available as output; only each
plant's aggregate values are reported.

I had to construct the stack for a particular hour to answer question about a
Homer City, NY plant we were studying a few years ago.  Attached is the SQL
query you can import into MS ACCESS to do the same thing for you (making
appropriate modifications to the year, hour, etc.)  Unfortunately, no Henwood
documentation on the output variables existed when I created this query, so I
can not really tell you what they represent anymore.  An acquaintance of mine
at Entergy and I were lobbying to get Henwood to provide some documentation,
so it may be available now.

Let's talk and maybe we can help you out,
Michael
