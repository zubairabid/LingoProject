I don't want to disrupt building a more collegial relationship here, but I
have some concerns about their reticence to sound more positive about
reaching agreement on our two key issues.  Can we put the question
differently:  what are the barriers to their concurrence and what can we do
together to address those barriers?  If the barriers for EEI are
insurmountable because of the recalcitrance of a few members, can they
facilitate a dialogue between us and a more progressive group?
