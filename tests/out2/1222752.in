Michelle,

Sorry, I should have been more clear on the 4 - 6 % vacation  pay. That is
the statutory minimum under the Employment Standards Act. It  applies to
non-union employees. It only applies to union employees if the  equivalent
provisions in the collective agreement do not "meet or exceed" the  Act's
provisions. Since the collective agreement's provisions are better than  the
provisions in the Act, the Act's vacation pay provisions do not apply to
union employees.

In terms of the payment schedule, for union employees the  collective
agreement stipulates they may take their vacation pay at the start of  the
year. I believe Celgar applies a similar policy for non-union employees, but
I'll check on that. When their actual time for vacation comes up, they may
actually have to take that time off without any pay if they've already
elected  to take the pay earlier.

For both union and non-union employees, vacation pay is earned  and accrued
in one year and paid out the next. So in 2001, all Celgar employees  will be
entitled to vacation pay based on a percentage of their 2000  earnings.

With respect to the standard employment contract, there really  isn't one,
save for the letter of employment that KPMG sent out to all  employees. The
letter from KPMG to Doug Cargill is a sample. It was in the  package I sent
on Friday last week. If you don't have it, please let me know and  I'll send
it.

There are also position descriptions for every union and  non-union employees
that are given to the employees upon hiring. These might  also be considered
part of the contract of employment, though they are not  incorporated into a
letter of employment.

Hope that answers your questions. Please let me know if I may  be of further
assistance.
