Also, here's fyi some of the questions that I came up with when going over
the case...
1. Problem #1 and #2: When calculating incremental cost do we include fixed
costs (i.e. $10,000 for tooling plastic rings) and do we include sunk costs
materials for the steel inventory?  In addition, do we need to break out the
overhead into fixed and variable and include only the variable portion in
the calculation of incremental cost?

2. Problem #3: What are we supposed to be comparing to calculate
differential cost of the 25,450 steel rings?

3. Problem #4: What time period should we include in calculating profit?  Is
it enough to look strictly at present time (per unit costs)? Or should we
look at profit over for example 5 years (from looking at the replacement
rate of plastic rings)?

4. Problem #5: Once we calculate problems #1 - #3, do we assume that
Burggeman is the only plastic ring producer?  And should we look at customer
desire to reduce their costs by buying plastic over steel rings because of
the difference in usable life?
