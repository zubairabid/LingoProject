The "two sides of a cross-portfolio deal" language is a bit vague and
misleading. A cross-portfolio deal is kind of like a desk to desk deal.
Another Enron book has traded with one of ours.
Two important things need to happen with cross-portfolio deals.
1. They need to only show on the forward obligation report when "Desk to
Desk" is selected.
2. They are only financial in nature, no physical delivery is ever done
cross portfolio.
I don't think "both sides" is correct. We need to only see our buy or our
sale when we query for our point.  When the other portfolio queries their
stuff, they should see their side.
