I have registered us for attendance on this conference call.  Anyone that
wants to attend can meet in the Conf Room 697 from 9:00-10:00 a.m. on
Thursday, October 12.  If any Houston staff want to attend the call, I will
probably have to register you separately.  Let me know if you would like to
listen in at the Houston location.

Dear CERA Members and Friends:

Are oil companies leaving money on the table in their use of benchmark crude
prices? What can be done to lower the risk in these potentially harmful
calculations?

One of Cambridge Energy Research Associates' (CERA) core businesses has been
benchmark crude oil price analysis. In our new multiclient study, "The Hole
in the Barrel", CERA goes beyond our benchmark price analyses to analyze the
structure of the market itself. We argue the limits and real economic losses
that can result from misunderstanding these prices - specifically the Brent
benchmark - in oil company financial calculations and strategic planning, the
magnitude of which can be significant, often amounting to dollars - not cents
- per barrel.

As an introduction to this new study, we would like to invite you to
participate in this complementary multimedia conference call and web
presentation on October 12, 2000. With the current volatility and high
levels of energy prices, this conference call will bring clarity to these
important and relevant issues.

To enroll for the call, please RSVP to 1-800-289-0579 or 719-457-2550 and
reference the Confirmation Code 984848 in order to participate in the call.

In this detailed study, CERA looks at what people really mean when they talk
about the oil price. As part of the study, we:

* Analyze each of the five contracts that make up the Brent market and
consider their long-term future given the steady decline of "wet" barrels,
including how other price markers might evolve.

* Outline how oil companies have more discretion to raise revenues (for a
given volume of production) than is generally appreciated.

* Examine each of the three components that make up oil prices (absolute
price level, time and grade differentials), to show where revenue is being
lost and what can be done to add it back again.

* Assess the management control issues associated with any market activity
and conclude that the risks of dealing are significant but not overwhelming,
especially in comparison to the underlying and increasing price risk that
they help to manage.

In this evolving New World, while trading may or may not be good for you, not
understanding the market can be fatal.

CONFERENCE CALL TOPICS:
* Brent Blend as a price benchmark for a significant proportion of
internationally traded crude oils.
* The fitness for purpose of each of the five interwoven but separate
contracts in the Brent market to different sectors of the oil industry

* The risks and rewards of dealing in the Brent market

Our speakers will address this topic for 20-30 minutes, with accompanying
graphics presented on the Internet, followed by an open question and answer
period.
