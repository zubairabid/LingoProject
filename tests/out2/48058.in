For your information,

Two temporary employees in West Power Trading, Tom Pinit (Receptionist) and
Alan Baumbusch (Clerk), have left Enron for employment more closely related
to their fields of endeavor.  They did a good job for us while they were at
Enron and we wish them well.

Two new employees, Erin Hall and Diana Stocker, are both from OfficeTeam, and
they just recently joined us.  They will be sharing the receptionist and
clerk duties.  Please don't hesitate to introduce yourself--Erin and Diana
are anxious to learn everyone's name and provide outstanding support.

If you have any questions, please contact me.
