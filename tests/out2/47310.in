Please take the time to update the shift note throughout the day.  The shift
notes need to show more than just the status of the position manager.  Extra
information put in the shift note is helpful for other group members and for
other traders on the floor.  The shift notes are also a well used resource
for volume and risk management groups.  Communication is important for
obvious reasons and I would like each member of the group to look to improve
this aspect of their job performance.
