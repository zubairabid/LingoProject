On Friday, September 1, 2000, I contacted Sandra Grimes and John Lopez and
informed them that a letter to disregard the Assignement and Assumption
Agreement would be forwarded to their offices on Tuesday, September 5, 2000.
Please let me know when this letter or agreement is complete so I can route
it for signature.  If it will not be ready today, please let me know.
