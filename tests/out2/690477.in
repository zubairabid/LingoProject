Below is the agenda for the TCPL MOU meetings next week.  I plan on attending
the first day and participating in the Services/Expansion/Turnback working
group #3 in the afternoon.  If it looks worthwhile I can continue to cover
selectively on later days as well.

If anyone has any concerns or questions please let me know.
