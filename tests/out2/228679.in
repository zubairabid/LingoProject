Sara,

Due to Marathon Ashland's recent request, for future confirms can we change
the current Rounding paragraph in their Confirms to:

For the purposes of the calculations of the Floating Price(s), (i) prices
quoted in Gallons shall be converted to Barrels by multiplying such price by
42 and (ii) Floating Prices(s) relating to commodities quoted in (i) gallons
shall be rounded to five places, (ii) MMBtu,s shall be rounded to four
places, (iii) barrels shall be rounded to three places and (iv) gigajoules
shall be rounded to four places. If the number after the final number is five
(5) or greater then the final number shall be increased by one (1), and if
the number after the final number is less than five (5) then the final number
shall remain unchanged.


Everything same, except adding the Gallons to Barrels conversion.

Thanks,
Joe
