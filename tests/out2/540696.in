Douglas,

A HUGE THANK YOU from me to you!  This is exactly what I was hoping for (even
if the amount of purchase is not what some folks might have been wishing for,
the reply is critically important)!  I really appreciate your having taken
the time to help out by providing this information.

I will check back with you on Thursday, if I haven't heard from you by then,
to see about the "commitment letter"!

Thank you again,

Jeff
p.s.  I will be forwarding your note to Randy Matson and Bob Martinez, to see
if it would help them in their efforts.  I'll also copy you on that one.
