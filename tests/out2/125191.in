Brenda,
Can you send me a copy of Bruce's response.  Also, we need to meet on Entex
this week as you suggest.  In my discussions with Bruce, he feels that Entex
can account for all of their gas nominations/takes - and that these
nominations are not related to intra-month price volatility.
We discussed having an initial meeting next week.  Then, if it makes sense, I
think we should involve MidCon in the discussions as their imbalances seem to
be a key factor in Entex changing their nominations.   These meetings would
be to seek to develop a working protocol that we could use to improve
communication and establish more definitive criteria for changing
nominations.
The end game would be a final meeting with Entex senior management to agree a
solution to past sins and a way forward.
