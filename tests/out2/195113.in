Mike / Jeff -

Please find attached a copy of the slide presentation Eskom (the state owned
utility in South Africa) will give to the Minister of Energy in early Dec.
Eskom, as a state owned entity, is involved in the development of the Black
Economic Empowerment mines (ie New Coal) as well as the traditionally
white-owned Junior Miners.  Eskom is a strong proponent of the expansion of
Richards Bay Coal Terminal or alternately the development of South Dunes Coal
Terminal.

As the Eskom presentation details, Enron is included in their plans to expand
their role in the RSA coal business regardless of which terminal is
developed.  Project Springbok is moving along well, and should result in
increasing flows from South Africa next year.  As a note Tom Kearney (London)
and Ivan van Niekerk (Joburg) have led this effort.  Ivan is with Enron
Metals, but it seems we have been able to borrow him on a virtual full time
basis - he has been great.
