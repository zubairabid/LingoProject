Anil,
Questions for you:  Is Zircom in an easily definable industry so we can make
comparable studies and valuations?  Is their much public history of the firm?
Will such an acquisition have a significant influence on Intel's earnings (my
guess is no since Zircom's latest annual revenue was only $500 million versus
Intel's $20+ billion revenue)?  Can we make reasonable future estimates of
Zircom's financial statements and business lines?
I, for one, have little knowledge or confidence in myself of analyzing a tech
company.  Given the fact that Anil is the only person in the industry from our
group we would be heavily reliant on him to give us strategic insight on the
companies and their businesses.  My preference- an industry that is relatively
more stable and simple for all of us to understand.  While we don't have to do
Amazon specifically, I would like an industry or company that won't require an
immersion of readings just to understand the product, sales distribution,
clients, distributors, etc.  Remember, we have to make guestimates about the
future of the industry and predict sales, costs, etc.  The nice thing about
Amazon (or a similar company) is that it is merely an Internet twist on an
industry with a very long history and an easy to understand business model.
Webvan could be another example.
Another idea:  Trying to value Fidelity Investments- a private company.  The
nice thing about this exercise is that there is a lot of data on comparable
companies (T. Rowe Price, Zurich Scudder, Franklin Templeton) and some public
information on Fidelity.  A good portion of our valuation would be based on
assumptions which means that as long as we can support our assumptions we
can't
be wrong.
