THE FRIDAY BURRITO

"If you aren,t confused, then you don,t understand the problem."

At first, I refused to deliver this Burrito until the next President is
elected.  But I eventually gave up.  How much longer will this craziness
go on?  The events are firmly stitched into the fabric of our culture,
now and for decades hence.  You can,t go to a conference nor have a
casual conversation with someone without the topic arising.  Columnist
Dave Berry had the best solution to fix the Florida ballots.  Put a
picture of each candidate on the ballot, give the voter a hand-held hole
punch, and punch out the eyes of the candidate for whom you wish to
vote.  Naturally, there would be squabbles about double punching, holes
that didn,t penetrate the picture (hence, the intent to vote), and all
the other particulars which disqualify a ballot.

Speaking of elected officials, Governor Davis re-delivered his message
to FERC this week, live and in person in San Diego.  He spoke to three
of the FERC Commissioners in San Diego, Ms. Breathitt being absent.  I
wasn,t there, but I heard the reports of those who were.  The reactions
ranged from "so what,s new?", to "this is good news".  The Gov.
re-iterated the request for refunds.  I don,t think that is good news,
and I don,t think the State has a legal prayer to order such.  One power
marketer in the Pacific Northwest, not a WPTF member but who soon will
be, called me to ask if he was going to lose his bonus because the State
was going to order refunds from generators and power marketers.  If Mr.
Davis wants to settle nerves of the investment community, then this
isn,t the way to do it.

The Gov. also endorsed the implementation of load-differentiated price
caps.  Read our lips, Mr. Gov.  Price caps don,t work, and
load-differentiated price caps damage markets.  They throw unnecessary
burdens on the settlement of transactions, and would all but effectively
kill long-term forward contracts.  Forward contracts seem to the be the
preferred way to solve California,s problems, assuming the PUC doesn,t
give blanket reasonableness to any and all contracts.  There must be
appropriate mechanisms for the PUC to provide incentives for the UDC,s
to procure prudently, and to avoid self-dealing with their non-regulated
subsidiaries. (Clue: license the utility owned plants to be Exempt
Wholesale Generators under the Energy Policy Act of 1992)

The Gov. also claimed that he supports competitive markets, but that the
markets are dysfunctional at present, and need time to mature, and work
out the severe demand-supply imbalance.  Mr. Gov. is taking quite a risk
that the investment community will continue to invest while he tries to
cap prices.  I don,t think this is a wise bet, but, on the other hand,
it is his political future at risk, not mine.  Once upon a time, Mr.
Peace unsuccessfully tried to tame the power market hoping it would be
an arrow in his political quiver.  He thought it would be both fun, and
expedient.  I my estimation, the ploy exploded in his hands, and sullied
his reputation.  Mr. Gov. is headed in the same direction.  It will only
take one small slip, and then he will be trying eagerly to cleanse
himself of the power dilemma.  I don,t think Davis, advisor on energy
matters is at all up to the task of protecting his boss.

I wonder how you folks outside of California feel about this?  I mean,
California politics are definitely having an effect on your ability to
transact business in the West.  I guess that is the way it goes.  Mr.
Davis doesn,t need to solve California,s power problem to be re-elected
Governor.  He is a shoo in, best I can tell, and given the political
leanings of the State.  He is staging himself as a presidential
candidate.  As such, he must appear to be fixing problems of a much
larger scale, and guess what shows up on his radar screen?  If the
market survives the purge, then the Gov., and all the other politicians
will take credit for saving the world.

I had the privilege of speaking at two seminars this week, both hosted
by New West Energy, and one taped investigative interview at the local
NBC station in San Francisco. The speaking engagements gave me an
opportunity to test sound bites on real humans, and I am relaxing the
definition of human, a bit, to include TV reporters.  I was pleased with
the outcome.

The public speeches were in Oakland and Irvine, respectively.  When I
arrived at the hotel in Oakland, Enron Energy Services also was having a
customer seminar just down the hall.  I walked over to their room to see
if I could get my speaker,s fee bid up from $0.  Guess who was in front
of Enron,s very packed room?  Sue Mara, one of our Board members.  She,
like I in the adjoining room, started our presentation lamenting the
political stew in which our restructured power industry currently
simmers.  Great minds think alike.  The fact that two ESPs were holding
customer meetings simultaneously might signal a long-awaited turn around
in the business.  Have we reached the ebb of ESP existence?  I don,t
know.

Here are the themes that I believe struck a chord with the audiences,
and I hope with the investigative report.  First,  California started
the restructuring process from a system of regulated cost-based rates
that was controlled by a few people: the utilities, the PUC, and not
very many others.  The few-people system responded to the Arab Oil
Embargo crises in the early 1970's by dumping tons of money into
renewable energy, and signing long-term QF deals that embedded oil-price
escalators that assumed $100/bbl a decade hence.  Add a nuclear unit
into the portfolio, and the sum of those brilliant decisions led to
California retail rates being 50% higher than the national average.  The
response to higher prices led to a better idea.  That is, market-based
rates that come from competition could be utilized to pay off the
egregious excesses of the past, and open up the system to all who both
desired and could chart their own energy future.  It would either erase
or significantly lessen the influence of the few-people system, and
replace that old system with a well populated many-agent paradigm: e.g.,
ISO, PX, scheduling coordinators, direct access customers, merchant
generators, etc.

After almost three years of the many-people competitive system, where
not too many people opted for direct access (but we sure populated those
stakeholder governing boards, now didn't we), the situation remains
problematic.  Some would say the current dilemma is a signal that
competition can,t work (that is, until we have either more supply, or
more demand response, or both), and we would be better off if everyone
had stable cost-based rates, just like the good ol, days.  THEN, I ask,
do you believe that giving back the power grid to the control of a "few"
will solve today,s problems, or do you think a market based approach
will more quickly resolve the supply/demand imbalance?  If you don,t
want to make choices about your energy future, then give Mr. Davis and
the UDCs your support.  They will gladly turn back the hands of the
clock.  If you want the freedom to make economic choices, then speak out
publicly regarding your support for continuing the competitive markets
for power.  Using the latter approach, lower prices will come about much
quicker.

The problems we have are difficult, but not impossible to fix.

Sermon is over.  Here is what is on this week,s agenda.
