Jennifer,

Thanks for your note!  As these trip details get more formalized, I'll keep
yopu copied.  For now, know that there are approximately 18 Wharton students
participating in 3  research projects-- Enron proposed topics-- called the
"Tiger Program".  They'll be visiting Enron, arriving Houston Thursday the
18th, Dinner at Churrasco's (their choice) on the 18th, Enron meetings on the
19th.

As the details unfold, I'll keep you and Jeff copied.

Thanks!

--Christie.
