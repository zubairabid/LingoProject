We are unable to complete a "prelim"  profit or loss statement because of
computer coding complications between enpower and portcalc.  Two of the I.T.
managers are working on it and think that they can complete their "fix"
Saturday.  They will call me at home with a report on their hopeful success.

I will leave you and John L. a voice mail regarding same if it is not
completed by Monday.
