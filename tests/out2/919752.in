Dear OU Team:

Thanks to each of you for your help this season.  As many of you know, this
past Super Saturday was quite a success!

I have included a list of the 7 candidates in attendance this past weekend.
Unfortunately, 2 out of the 7 candidates will not receive offers.  I have
indicated them in gray.

I have personally called all 7 candidates to inform them of their offer
status.

Thanks again for all your help!  Please feel free to call and congratulate
these superstars!
