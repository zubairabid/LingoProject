Yahoo! Sports Catches 'Big Air & Style' with U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team;
Leading Sports Site Enters into Marketing and Content Agreement as Exclusive
Internet Sponsor

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Dec 11, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Yahoo! (Nasdaq:YHOO), a
leading global Internet communications, commerce and media company, today
announced a fully-integrated marketing and content agreement with the U.S. Ski
and Snowboard Team. Through the agreement, Yahoo!(R) Sports
(http://sports.yahoo.com) receives title sponsorship of the "Yahoo! Sports Big
Air & Style" series, a set of three nationally-televised competitions on this
season's snowboard circuit. Content about U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team events,
including top news coverage from this year's World Cup circuit, is also
accessible on Yahoo! Sports(a), the Web's most popular sports site(b).

The relationship also calls for the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team to utilize
Yahoo!'s global network of branded Web properties as a marketing platform for
athlete chats on Yahoo! Chat (http://chat.yahoo.com), e-commerce initiatives
and
sweepstakes during the season. In addition to the Yahoo! Sports Big Air &
Style
series, Yahoo! Sports serves as a sponsor of seven freestyle and snowboarding
races this season, all of which are aired on national broadcast networks.
Yahoo!
Sports patches will also appear on all of the U.S. Snowboard Team uniforms.

"We are extremely pleased to continue our affiliation with the U.S. Ski and
Snowboard Team following last year's successful marketing relationship," said
Mike Kelley, senior brand manager, Yahoo! Sports. "This relationship is
natural
brand fit for Yahoo!, and is core to our strategy of teaming with key
organizations that provide national exposure for the Yahoo! brand, while
bringing compelling content to Yahoo! Sports and our audience around the
world."

"World Cup skiing and snowboarding is one of the most popular multi-national
sports," said Bill Marolt, U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team president and CEO, and
a
former Olympic ski racer. "So it's exciting for us to have the support of a
truly global company such as Yahoo!"

The Yahoo! Sports Big Air & Style series comprises three separate races: Dec.
16
in Okemo, Vt.; Jan. 6, 2001 at Breckenridge, Colo.; and Feb. 10 at Mammoth
Mountain, Calif. Yahoo! Sports receives extensive branding leading up to and
throughout the events, including integration into event and network promotion
along with on-mountain signage. The additional seven races sponsored by Yahoo!
Sports will culminate with the X-nix U.S. Snowboard Championships in March
2001.


Catch World Cup Skiing and Snowboarding

Ski and snowboard enthusiasts can also rely on Yahoo! Sports Outdoors, the
outdoors-related area of Yahoo! Sports, to follow U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team
athletes in this year's World Cup series. The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team is

snowboarding throughout the 2000-2001 ski season, complementing additional
leading content providers, such as the Associated Press, Quokka Sports,
Reuters,
and SportsTicker(R), that give access to the World Cup news, results and
standings.

The U.S. Ski and Snowboard Team is managed by the U.S. Ski and Snowboard
Association (USSA), which is the national governing body for Olympic skiing
and
snowboarding, managing competition and athletic programs coast-to-coast. The
vision of USSA is to make the United States of America the best in Olympic
