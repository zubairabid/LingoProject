Thor,

Thanks for the email.  The timing of it is amazing.  We were talking about
this yesterday late afternoon.  Jeff and I will be in London next week to
meet everyone and to get a full briefing of activities and everyone's views
of their markets.  Cathy Phillips, my assistant, booked us to go to Norway to
meet you and hear about all the activities that are going on there.  I hope
you are in and can give us a full download on your business and obviously
weather.  We made arrangements to go on Thursday and stay Thursday night.  We
made these plans in advance of knowing your availability.  Do you have dinner
plans on Thursday evening?  We are scheduled to leave on Friday morning to
return to Houston.

Please send me a return email to confirm availability and Cathy will add to
our schedules.  I look forward to meeting you and learning about your
successful business.  Jeff and I will be available for your entire staff, if
you would like us to talk about what is going on back in Houston.


Thanks,
mike
