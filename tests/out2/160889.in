SB 1217 is sponsored by GTE.  AOL was initially a big supporter, but
with their recent merger they will probably will not maintain that
position.  The bill is sitting in the Assembly Utilities Committee with
no hearing date, probably due to Assemblyman Rod Wright's contempt for
the notion of open access.  I will fax you both a copy of a memorandum I
sent to Scott Bolton on October 28 explaining my point further.
According to Senator Alarcon's office, they do intend to bring the bill
up, but not until much later in the session.
