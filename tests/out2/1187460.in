Hey Dave!
Thanks for your note.  Believe it or not, it actually is "good to be back."
And thanks to Louise's timely intervention, I actually get to stay in Houston
this week instead of coming over to London for the ISDA meetings.
We discussed the need to have the lawyers review the long descriptions
yesterday and Mark Dilworth is checking on whether or not all the lawyers
actually have access to the necessary programs on their machines.  He and I
are meeting later this morning to talk about several of the items in your
note and we have a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning to show all the
lawyers involved how to use the system to review the long descriptions.
The other topics I had on my list to keep moving this week are the matching
of GTC's with products and continued progress on the Counterparty spreadsheet.
Harry Collins is the emissions guy.  I'm assuming he'll be part of this
process tomorrow and I'll ask him to take a close look at the long
descriptions and how the mesh with the GTC's.
Finally, I agree with you on the GTC variables issue.  My plan is to ask the
lawyers involved to focus on this as they review the long descriptions for
which they are responsible.  With me here to answer questions that may result
in more progress but I'm still not convinced that's enough.  I hope to be
able to spend some of my own time looking at these as you have over the last
couple of weeks but realistically I don't think that will happen very soon.
Maybe you can help me prioritize:  should I look first at areas with
predicted high volume or areas where we have the least confidence in the
quality of work to date?
Talk to you soon.
