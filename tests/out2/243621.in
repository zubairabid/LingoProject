It has been my understanding that the first section is supposed to be for
master swap agreements only.  Having other documents listed in that section
may be misleading to some parties who may misconstrue their use for general
trading purposes, such as Global Contracts.  That is why we created the
"Other Agreements" section, to house these other agreements.  My
understanding isthat the only reason other agreements has been listed in the
Master Swap Agreements Section is that they have been done so erroneously.
The drop down were not created too artfully created, allowing wrong
agreements to be put in Master Swap Agreements, which has been
proliferating.  If my understanding is not correct, than when did the
intentional use of that first section change?  I think putting all agreement
is a very bad idea.
