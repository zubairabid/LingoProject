Ben:

I have been able to locate a copy of the Peoples Energy letter we were
looking for last week.  I still need to obtain copies of the "as built"
drawings for the pipeline lateral.  These drawings were in one of the last
groups of documents which I sent to the data room.

Please locate these drawings and have copies sent up to Stuart Zisman.  Aaron
Roffwarg at Bracewell & Patterson will send these copies to ComEd so that
they may record their easement and we can then obtain our title policy on the
pipeline lateral (this is needed for sale purposes).

I will be in Chicago tomorrow and Friday.  I will be on vacation Monday and
in Chicago Tuesday.  I will be back in the Houston office on Wednesday of
next week.

Thanks for you attention to this matter.

Fred
