Thanks for being on top of this.  As I mentioned in my voice mail to you on
Friday, no trader should conclude a transaction on behalf of ENA while
located in a foreign country.  On several discrete occasions we have
sanctioned exceptions to this rule but each such case had unique facts that
permitted us to conclude that those transactions were OK.  Further, any
physical presence by ENA is a foreign country is generally a bad idea because
it supports a foreign tax authority's argument that ENA is doing business in
their country.  Thus, because of that general concern, no Instinet terminal
should be put in place on behalf of ENA in a foreign country (especially
since for what purpose would such a thing be used - trading?) but, rather, an
appropriate foreign affiliate of Enron should contract for such service (in
this respect, you should speak with Janine Juggins in our London tax group -
Janine is our resident trading tax expert in London and will be very familiar
with the things described in this E-mail).  I will be out of the country this
week (returning the week of the 18th) and can be reached at the Vancouver
Hotel in Vancouver, British Columbia.  Best regards.  Steve.
