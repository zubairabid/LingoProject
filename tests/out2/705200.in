I was talking with Bill Olson at the NMOCD this afternoon about some other
issues and inquired about Equilon's reputation. Bill indicated that he has
had only limited experience dealing with Equilon and apparently has not had
any bad experience with them. Bill said that they have an abatement project
ongoing at their Jal Basin Station near Jal, NM. He said that his contact on
this project is primarily with their consultant, H2A. I am not familiar with
H2A, but Bill said that they were recently formed from a couple of folks who
left KEI to form the new company. Bill also indicated that he has had some
contact with some folks at Equiva, which he believes is an internal
consulting division of Equilon.
