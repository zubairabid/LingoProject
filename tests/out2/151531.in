Yeah, they are in our spare closet.  That has been the extent of their use
for the past few years.  Just holding up boxes of crap.  I have actually be
looking for some good musicians to jam with, but i guess you will do :)
Anyway, we need to hook up again.  Maybe at Keneally's?  What are you doing
this Thursday?
