Alan & Harry
Since your group is the only other group besides the financial group that has
a product on the pulp & paper website, it is my intention to only send the
two of you their spreadsheets.  However, it appears the physical side of the
business (except for power) never says no, so if you prefer, I won't send you
the list.  It's up to you.  Let me know.
