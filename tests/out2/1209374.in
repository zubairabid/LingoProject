Apologies for my Jerry McGuire-type long winded Memo, but I wanted articulate
my thoughts in detail to avoid confusion.  We should get together to discuss
these thoughts if we all see some opportunities here....

ENW's Goals:
To leverage the brand value residing in EnronOnline to help brand and create
value for Enron's other e-commerce initiatives (DealBench, ClickPaper,
CommodityLogic, etc.).
To find new ways to further develop and commercialize ENW's existing
platforms - i.e. use them to generate greater revenues and/or enhance their
intrinsic value in the market.
To strategically develop new businesses using Enron Net Works' core skills.
This should/will lead to medium-longer term revenues on a sustainable basis.
To generate short-medium term revenues to meet targets and allow breathing
room for longer term initiatives.

Landscape:
Few days ago, I came across this blurb on one of the online news updates
(Upside.com):
Meanwhile ( British Telecommunications' (BTY) internal incubator Brightstar
announced Wednesday an agreement to work with U.S. based technology operating
company incuVest, a $100 million holding company, to create companies in the
communications field based on British Telecomm's 13,000 patents.

Thoughts:
BT's 13,000 patents are probably mostly technological patents or process
related patents.
No organization has the "Bandwidth" (i.e. resources) to commercialize this
many patents by itself in a short period of time.  Doing it all themselves
would mean having to work on commercializing these patents in a sequential
manner - which could take years.
Given the nature of these (and all other) patents, time-to-market is critical
since disruptive technologies can render these assets valueless.
Even companies with adequate resources, won't have all the skills required to
develop new businesses, since e-platforms require commercial, technological,
legal, regulatory, and development approaches that span across various
countries and industries.
Hence, it would be in BT's best interests to try and:
Focus on commercializing only the select patents that they think may offer
them most value, and in which they have a truly developed skill-base.
Monetize the remaining patents by giving them away in exchange for equity, or
by selling them.  This will also help raise money to re-deploy towards
commercializing the higher value patents.

Pitch:
Enron Net Works would be the perfect partner/solution provider for BT and
others to:
Evaluate the potential commercial value of BT's technological and process
related patents so they can decide to whether incubate them internally or
monetize them.
Auction-off patents which BT considers to be less valuable via Deal Bench
(which has data rooms capabilities to showcase patent specific information as
well as an ability to host several clients).
Commercialize patents (with BT and or other people who participate in the
auctions) by providing a well-branded business development infrastructure
(e.g. "from the company that developed the worlds biggest e-commerce site in
record time").

Benefits to ENW:
Generate short-term revenues from DealBench's auction/data-room platform
while branding it in the longer run.
Gain access to ideas and partners with whom we can develop new opportunities.
Branch out into servicing other companies that hold proprietary information
(patents, etc.) like Lucent Technologies, Xerox, and others.  Companies like
this have been battered in the equity markets recently and would be open to
ideas which helps them monetize some of their intellectual assets to appease
the share-holders.
Have secondary benefits of knowing what's being developed in the markets (by
plugging into a network of people and companies who've bought these patents
and are commercializing them).  This may allow us to invest in new ventures
that hold promise when the market outlook improves in the future.

Why Enron Net Works?
Our experience across industries and geography allows us to leverage our
experiences to evaluate commercial opportunities.
Once the value has been identified, we can use DealBench to monetize unwanted
assets in the broader market.
We have experience and the support infrastructure on which we can rely to
minimize the development time (legal, tax, regulatory, technological, and
commercial support) just like we did with EnronOnline.
Having industry and development experience has given us better skills to
develop new opportunities compared to consultants and incubators (who
typically don't have these "real-world" business experiences.
Core skills include:
Evaluating technology and implementing it in the most scaleable manner,
Valuing the technology and opportunities from a financial standpoint,
Commercial and market based insights which are increasingly valuable in the
e-World where everything is getting commoditized due to decreasing
interaction costs and increasing transparency.  ENW can quantify the value
chain in these new industries.
Enron's overall ability to manage risks in an array of commodity markets.

Steps Forward - dedicate some resources to:
Understand what it takes to do this and analyze whether we truly have the
skills and resources to execute on this (e.g. Is DealBench built for this?
Do we have the right skills?, etc.).  We may also have to ally with some of
the technology-specific skills within EBS.
Identify the optimum number of new opportunities that can be valued,
auctioned and/or developed by ENW.  This number may be only looking at 5
opportunities at a time or auctioning-off no more than 100.  This is okay
since we don't want to over extend ourselves (since our credibility is at
stake).
Identify top-level contacts with each of these organizations (BT and their
partner incuVest, Lucent, Xerox, etc.) whom we can sell on our idea.
Develop a contingency plan if the likes of BT, Lucent, and Xerox don't buy-in
due ENW not having done similar things before.  In this case, we could mine
the patent database to identify the owners and approach some of the smaller
shops (or other Mom-and-Pop owners) to buy and develop these things.  This
will allow us to develop an internal process and also develop a "history".

If the patent holders have qualms about accidentally selling some patents
with significant value (like Xerox has done in the past), we can structure
creative contracts which allow them to share in the upside by retaining a
certain percentage of the future earnings of the patent buyers (somewhat like
a portfolio of equity in start-up companies).  Enron can even help provide
liquidity for these "portfolios" in the future.

Let me know if you have any questions/ideas.
