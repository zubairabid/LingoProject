Today I ordered the wooden floral chest from Learn and Play for Elena.  I
also ordered a child's tool set so she can work along with Tim.  I didn't
include the things I was ordering for the others on the lists I sent you.
I just couldn't get my act together on Elena and didn't want to wait to
send your e mail until I had made a decision.

I went over to Montgomery Inn last week and looked at their rooms.  They
are nothing to brag about--a huge room that is divided by sliding doors
into smaller rooms.  Even divided it may seem pretty big for 30 people
which is the minimum for which we must pay.  I don't think we should have
any trouble finding that many people to invite.  It is still available
and we have the contract which we will sign and send back by Friday, the
deadline.  It is fairly expensive, but this is a rather important
occasion so we have decided to go ahead with it.

Dad and I finally got our flu shots this morning at our clinic.  It is a
relief to have that accomplished!

Love, Mother
