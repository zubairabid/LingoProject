Greg,

Are you interested in discussing opportunities with E*steel at another
time?   I would like to have Mr. Belew call you to set up an appointment in
the near future.  Let me know what your objective is with Enron Networks, and
if you are pursuing the same online platform growth in steel that we are in
natural gas.  Do you see opportunities in trading steel products as a
commodity at some point, and if so, will Enron be active in making markets
not only on EOL, but on other platforms?

I appreciate your taking the time to entertain their questions.  Thank you
for your assistance.

sincerely,
Mike Grigsby
Director, West Gas Trading
