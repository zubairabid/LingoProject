I am sure that New York requires that we submit your bar number so that you
can get CLE credits.  Maybe you could call the New York CLE Committee
(212/428-2105) to obtain your bar number-they will not give that to someone
other than yourself.  I am getting responses from the other attorneys
licensed in New York to give me their NY bar numbers--so they exist and maybe
you just need to call NY to find out why you do not have your bar number.
