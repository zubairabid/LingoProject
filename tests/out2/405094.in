TURKEY WEEK STATS:  This Thanksgiving holiday season is expected to usher in
the busiest air travel days yet, with an estimated 20 million passengers
traveling during the week and half surrounding the holiday.  According to the
Air Transport Association, the Sunday after Thanksgiving will likely see a
record-setting increase in traffic over last year's holiday season.  Over 2.2
million passengers are expected to occupy over 85 percent of seats on Sunday,
November 26, 2000.  If you're flying home for a slice of mom's pumpkin pie,
anticipate full planes and crowded terminals throughout Thanksgiving week.
Thanksgiving Day itself is a safe bet for travelers; the ATA estimates that
only 52.6 percent of seats will be occupied that day.  Check tomorrow's
OneTravel.com Hot List newsletter for holiday travel tips from our experts.

MR. MAXIMILER: Our newest column from OneTravel.com's own Frugalist, Bob
Jones, features up-to-the-minute tips and deals that maximize your air miles
and save you travel cash.  Read on for this week's "Mr. Maximiler" tip!

The Turkey Trot is more than a dance.

This week, between now and Saturday, virtually all the airlines will notice
that their planes are going to be empty Thanksgiving Day. Even though the
week surrounding Thanksgiving Day is one of the busiest air travel periods in
North America, the planes on Turkey Day lack the appropriate stuffing of
passengers.

You can make this work to your advantage!  Let's say that you live in
Chicago. Wednesday evening, your wife says to you, "Honey, take the turkey
out of the freezer downstairs and bring it up so it will thaw."  Dutifully,
you reply, "Yes dear," and go back to the Bulls game.  Thursday morning while
you are finishing up your beauty rest, there is a shriek from the kitchen.
Running in, you see the remains of the bird on the floor and your Lab with a
big smile on his face. Yep, you brought the turkey upstairs but put it on the
table, not the fridge, to thaw. It looks like it will be crow for dinner for
you and the pup.  What to do?

As empty-nesters, you are free to do whatever you want.  You call the few
places serving Thanksgiving dinner. You find little availability at this late
date. The hotel has one table left at 9 p.m., but the bill will probably be
in the three-figure range. Wait, you remembered reading this column last week
and pick up the phone. Your daughter, who married that guy whose name you
can't remember, invited you to Indianapolis for Thanksgiving, her first on
her own.  "Hi, Honey, I want to surprise your mom.  Does that invitation for
dinner still stand?"

"Oh, Pops, you know it does, but hasn't it been snowing a little in town?"

"Yes, dear, but don't worry, we won't be driving. What time is dinner?"

"Three o'clock, Dad, just before the game. You and Fred can watch it. Love
you, Dad, see you soon."

Back on the phone you find a fare of $120 roundtrip per person. (That is the
current low price but I expect to drop even more over the next few days.) So
you book your flights, tell your wife to get dressed for dinner and head for
the airport. You arrive in Indianapolis, spend a wonderful day with your
daughter and Fred (whom you realize knows absolutely nothing about football)
and catch your flight home at 7 p.m.  In bed by 9 p.m., your wife rolls over
and says, "Thanks for a wonderful day!"

Over the next few days, you will see some exceptional deals for travel on
Thanksgiving Day.  Watch for them, just in case!

Happy Contrails,
Bob "Mr. Maximiler" Jones
