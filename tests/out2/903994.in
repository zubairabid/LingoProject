Attaching Files to E-Mail

Readers wrote in saying they thought attaching WAVs to e-mail was a great
idea, but how do you do it? It's easy! First you have to save the WAV in a
folder, which you can name "My Sounds" or "WAV Files" or "Funny Noises."
Create the appropriate folder, and then save the sound file in it. To do
that, go to the Web page, click on the file you want to save, and choose
"Save this file to disk." Navigate to your sound folder and click "save."
When you're ready to attach it to an e-mail, open a new message and, in
Outlook, choose Insert-File (or click the paper clip icon). In Netscape the
attach button and the paper clip icon are on the same button -- other e-mail
programs, like Eudora, have similar features. Just navigate to the folder
with all your sounds in it, and click the one you want to add. You can't make
it play automatically unless the recipient has their e-mail program set to
open files automatically when they are received -- a bad idea beca! use of
the virus risk. Remember, never open an attachment from a source you don't
know and trust, even if it says it's a picture, sound, or text file -- clever
viruses hide their true file extension. You open a seemingly harmless
attachment, and you've got the virus. It's too late to be careful once your
machine is destroyed!

Today's Science & Technology News:

Mars, the Land o' Lakes
New images may show sedimentary rocks on Mars that could have been formed by
lakes in crater basins. Such rocks would be the best place to look for fossil
evidence of life. The oldest known ancestor of humankind has been discovered
in Africa. And a temporary imbalance in British cows' milk is leaving the
country's lattes frothless. Also -- balky space station solar panel --
"Pro-Linux" virus -- Sierra Nevada logging halt -- new uses for gold -- and
job stress linked to back pain. Click  here to read more!
