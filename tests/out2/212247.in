If organizational changes that are announced together are expected to be
bound together by a common theme, then this announcement may fall a bit
short.  The continuing growth of the demands placed upon the Government
Affairs organization has, however, necessitated certain modest organizational
shifts and additions, many of which have already occurred or have been in
transition for the last several weeks.  Rather than attempting to explain the
rationale for each change in this memo, instead, I will briefly describe them
(attached is a revised organizational chart and map), and offer to answer any
questions anyone might have.

While Sue Nord will continue to report directly to me in the role of policy
development and coordination, she has been and will be spending a
considerable amount of her time on broadband and communications issues and
will also report to Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere in that capacity.
Steve Montovano will assume responsibility for an additional six southeastern
states, including responsibility for SERC.  Marchris Robinson and Tom
Chapman, who has agreed to join the group on a more permanent basis as a
Senior Regulatory Specialist, will report to Steve.  Ron McNamara has also
joined Steve,s group and will focus on the tight power pools in the Northeast
U.S.
Janine Migden will assume responsibility for the states of Tennessee,
Arkansas, and Louisiana as well as issues related to TVA.  Bill Moore will
now report to Janine.
In order to assure more intraregional coordination in the West, Mary Hain,
who supports ENA,s trading desk in Portland, now reports to Paul Kaufman.
With Kathleen Magruder,s recent departure to ResCo, we are actively searching
for an individual to direct our efforts in Texas and Oklahoma as well as our
efforts at ERCOT and the Southeast Power Pool.
Scott Bolton and Donald Lassere have each done an outstanding job supporting
Enron Broadband Services throughout the world these past months and will
share responsibility for directing those efforts in the Americas.  They will
also assume responsibility within the group for Enron,s E-Commerce efforts in
the Americas.  In addition to Sue Nord, the group will consist of Tracy
McLaughlin, who supports Scott in Portland, Xi Xi, an analyst who joined us
early this year in Houston and Lara Leibman who has just joined the group.
Lara will also continue her activities relative to the Department of Justice
and the Federal Trade Commission.
Ricardo Charvel, in addition to his responsibilities in Mexico, will assume
overall responsibility for Central America, the Caribbean Basin as well as
Columbia and Venezuela.  Reporting to Ricardo are Alberto Levy, who is
primarily responsible for Venezuela and Columbia and Vinio Floris, who
recently joined us from Azurix, who will be primarily responsible for Central
America and the Caribbean Basin.
Tom Delaney will now report to Jeff Brown and will support him in our
continuing efforts to bring additional reform and standardization to
wholesale power markets in the U.S.  Damon Harvey has also joined Jeff,s
group as an analyst.
Gloria Ogenyi, Thane Twiggs and Robert Neustaedter have all joined Harry
Kingerski,s group to enhance that group,s ability to provide rates and other
regulatory services throughout the Americas.
With Tom Reichelderfer,s departure, Susan Covino will be the sole coordinator
for the government affairs group,s contractual relationship with ResCo.
Susan will also begin to get involved in other projects over the next several
weeks.
The Federal Government Affairs group organization will have a flatter
organizational structure with each individual in the group reporting directly
to Joe Hillings.  Functional assignments, which are reflected on one of the
attachments, have also been made in this group to bring additional focus to
their efforts, with an increased emphasis on issues related to our energy,
broadband services and e-commerce-based business activities and a refocusing
of the group,s efforts in support of commercial groups globally to better
align them with the near and mid-term objectives of the regional commercial
groups throughout the world.   On a separate note, Tom Briggs will be joining
the Federal Government Affairs group in Washington early this summer.  We are
pleased to have Tom, who has most recently been in London in the Enron Europe
Government Affairs group, join the Federal Government Affairs team.

Please join me in welcoming, congratulating, and wishing well the individuals
noted in this memo.

One final thought.  As we are quickly approaching the mid-point of the year
2000, we must stay constantly  focused on our overall group objectives for
the year as well as on our respective regional group objectives (see attached
'Top 10' objectives for U.S. & Canada).  With that said, the hard work and
dedication of so many individuals in the group does not go unnoticed.  As the
group has grown, it has become increasingly difficult for me to visit the
regions as frequently as I once did and to spend as much time on an
individual basis with many of you.  My respect, gratitude and affection for
the people in this group only grows, however, with time.  Our collective
task, while both challenging and intellectually stimulating, is also quite
daunting with both ever growing burdens and opportunities as the company
continues to grow and prosper.  We must continue to work hard to meet our
objectives, but we must also find a way to keep our work and jobs in their
proper perspective and to have fun during the journey.  Whatever I can do to
help meet those objectives I will do, and, of course, am always open to
suggestions in that regard.

Thank you
