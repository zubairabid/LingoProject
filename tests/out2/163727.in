Advice Letters:

San Diego filed an advice letter (1260-E) which I faxed two weeks ago dealing
with the application of the rate cap to DA customers.  Subsequently, October
30, SDG&E filed an amended advice letter 1260-E-A (replacing 1260-E).  The
earlier advice letter had a lot more specificity about how to deal with
applying the credit to DA customers that the amended advice letter omits.  We
need to determine if we wish SDG&E to include any of the following in their
treatment of the credit for DA customers.  We have 20 days from October 30 to
file a protest.

For example:

If the customer received consolidated billing service from the utility, the
credit from the cap would be applied against the otherwise applicable San
Diego charges.

If the customer was dual billed, the credit would apply against the San Diego
portion of the bill.

If the customer received ESP consolidated billing from the ESP, the credit
would be highlighted through a separate line item.  If the credit surpassed
SDG&E's charges, there would be no amount payable to SDG&E for that month.
If there was a credit balance remaining against SDG&E's charges, it could be
carried over into the next month, or cashed out.

SDG&E provided a second option.  This would provide the credits to the ESP
and the ESP would be responsible for any future repayment of the cost.

We have until November 7 to file comments on their proposal.  I think we
would appreciate a separate line-item identifying the amount of the credit.
However, I believe the identification should be the same for all customers,
irrespective of the billing choice.  Because we currently don't have an
obligation to flow through the PX credit amount to our customers, I don't
believe we should have an obligation to flow-through the additional credit
relative to the cap, but we need legal review of my assumption.

We may also want to consider if we have a preference for how we would handle
the additional credit relative to the cap for our customers.  That may help
us decide if we want to support having the option of choosing between a
line-item or managing those funds for our customers.  (This is another way of
alleviating a customer's concern about a balloon payment at some future date.)

Some ESPs are also approaching SDG&E about an "opt-out" provision of the rate
cap for DA customers.  I am concerned, and am checking, to see if SDG&E can
legally do this.

Customer Facilitation Program:

The majority of the ESPs elected to wait until the issue of the
implementation of the rate cap was decided before doing a mailing.  The
majority also preferred one mailing to two.  Therefore, this program will not
kick off until probably some time in January 2001.

Any questions, feel free to contact me.   Thanks.
