I'm still not wild about 27.5, which says they have no liability for any
advice they give us which is not required by the agreement.  It seems that we
could get into an argument about causation of a problem, and what was in/out
of their scope under the agreement.
I don't know that I have any brilliant ideas about how to narrow this carve
out. I guess we could say no liability so long as the advice is clearly
outside the scope of work, and is given in good faith and in accordance with
industry standards.
