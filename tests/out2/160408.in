Thanks Mona, good summary.  I would like to discuss making the following
proposals to the commission:
1)  Require PG&E to submit their evaluation criteria and weighting in advance
of the auction.  This will help eliminate any subjectivity that favors their
affiliate.  If the commission is interested in a fair auction with no
preference given to pge gen, this request should be hard to argue with.  It
may also give us information about how they will try to move this process in
pge gen's favor.  It also gives us a platform to debate the auction process
and gain some additional concessions.
2)  Propose that any negative tax ramifications for ratepayers and state
residents resulting from a sale to the affiliate should be factored out of
the affiliate's bid.  This will create a more level playing field and
maximize the value to ratepayers.  We may want to get Arthur Anderson
involved in helping with this assessment.
3)  Have the bids independently evaluated by one or more third parties
selected by consensus of the interested parties.
Also, are there any market power issues with the affiliate owning this much
generation in the utility service area?  How could the affiliate
theoretically abuse this generation to benefit the utility or PG&E corp?
These issues should also be highlighted in any filing.
The outcome of this auction is extremely important to EES.  We stand to make
considerably more money the higher the sale price.  From my perspective, it's
a top priority for us to apply whatever resources are needed to ensure a fair
auction.  The other factor to consider is time, which works against us.
I would appreciate discussing our plan of action in this proceeding.  If we
need to develop a plan, we are more than happy to help.
