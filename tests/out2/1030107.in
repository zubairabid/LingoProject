i actually started writing this on thursday.  got distracted and left late
morning to go to Vail.  Apparently I missed a little craziness.  My point
on v/x is that forward spreads, months 3/4 and back, don't necessarily
trade on value, they trade on drawing a forward curve that makes
equilibrium between hedging and spec demand.  Look at k/m... do you think k
cash will average 3 cents above m.  i don't really see that scenario.  yet
that's what it is worth because the market says jv is worth $x and to get
there k/m=3.  The same argument applies to v/x.  i think this summer will
be exceptionally strong as we try to inject 2 bcf/d more gas than last
year.  But cal 2 will lag the move.  It's the main thing customers are
selling right now because every equity analyst and even Pira are telling
their customers that cal 2 will average 3.50.  so either the v/x and x/z
spreads come in or f/g g/h h/j blow out.  After this winter, who in there
right mind wants to buy f/g or g/h again.  my thought is that the primary
juice will be h/j but v/x and x/z will be under some pressure.  i'm a
seller at 9 and buyer at 5-6.  Not much in it either way though.
