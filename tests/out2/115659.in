Richard:
Could you please take a look at point #6.  This is the online counterparty
who had requested in their arbitration language that only monetary damages
are available as a remedy in any arbitration proceeding and that under no
circumstances shall specific performance be an available remedy against
them.  Please let me know what you think.  Thanks.
