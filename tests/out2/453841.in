of Mexico.

NPDES Multi-Sector General Permit --  Jim Peterson distributed an information
email on the EPA reissuance of the NPDES multi-sector general permit for
storm water discharges associated with industrial activities to Enron
environmental personnel in affected states.

DOT Amendments to Hours of Service (HOS) Regulations - Russell Tucker, with
assistance from Jeff Keeler, issued comments to the DOT on behalf of Enron
ETS concerning the adverse impact the current proposed amendments to the HOS
regulation would have on the company's ability to operate and respond to
emergencies without an unreasonable increase in operating costs.

Petition for Extension of Time - Russell Tucker asked the NAM OSHA Steering
Committee to consider joining Organization Resources Counselors, Inc. (ORC)
in asking OSHA through a letter of petition for an extension of time to
establish full compliance with the Ergonomics Program Grandfather clause .
The request is under NAM legal review to ensure standing suits against OSHA
in connection with the Ergonomics Program final rule would not be adversely
affected.

expected to be adopted as part of the international ISO certification
standards after acceptance by ANSI and likely to affect any revival of the
once proposed OSHA rule making on the same subject.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

Clean Air - EPA Mercury Determination:   On Thursday, 12/14, EPA issued its
mercury determination, deciding there is a need to regulate mercury emissions
from power plants and laying out a timetable for developing the necessary
regulations.  EPA indicated that it would consider "flexible" measures for
complying with regulations, including trading, but no further details were
included in the determination.  Jeff Keeler provided information on this
regulation to Enron Americas power trading and origination, EGM
coal/emissions traders, EES and other corporate groups.

Clean Air - Section 126 Rule Litigation:   Federal District court in D.C.
will hear oral arguments on Friday, 12/15 on the EPA's section 126 rule,
which grants relief to northeast states who petitioned for greater control of
NOx at sources in "upwind" states.   The federal Section 126 rule is
scheduled to go into effect for sources in May 2003 -- 1 year sooner than
similar state-developed regulations will go into effect for the same sources
under the NOx SIP Call.  The outcome of the litigation is important because a
ruling for industry could give sources another year to plan for emissions
controls.  Jeff Keeler will issue a report on the litigation to Enron
Americas, EGM, EIM, EES, and other impacted corporate groups.

Power Quality/Distributed Generation:  Stacey Bolton and Mary Schoen
continued to provide assistance to EES' Premium Power group as they look at
environmental drivers for their business model.  Stacey delivered detailed
information on federal incentive programs for distributed generation and Mary
provided assistance and analysis of environmental regulations in EES' target
states.

EPA Green Power RFI:   Stacey Bolton provided information to EES (Richard
Ring) in response to an RFI for the supply of green power to EPA in Ohio.
(Part of the information that will be included in the RFI response will be
the Enron EHS annual report).   Stacey also talked with APX about their
exchange in Ohio and the potential for EES to price out a deal for green
credits to use in the potential deal w/ EPA.  APX is very interested in doing
a deal w/ EES, and has landfill credits for EES to bid on.  Stacey provided
this information to EES.

Renewable Energy Credits:  Stacey organized a conference call w/EGM and EES
supply desk to discuss potential partnerships with Clean Power Markets (Green
Credit Exchange and Verification company).  EES will likely become an anchor
customer of the exchange.  Followed up with Richard Shapiro, Jim Steffes and
Lisa Yoho regarding the potential partnership (Clean Power Markets had
originally approached Rick about a partnership & he passed it along to
Stacey.)

ADVOCACY/COMMERCIAL SUPPORT

Clean Air - NOx SIP Call:  Mary Schoen continued work on development of State
Implementation Plans (SIPs) in several key Enron States, including Illinois,
Tennessee, and Indiana.   States had until October 31, 2000 to submit SIPs to
EPA for approval or face preemption by federal NOx rules, but EPA informally
extended that deadline until the end of the year.  Mary is submitting
comments to these states as they prepare their final SIPs.
Tennessee:  will be less of a priority with the sale of the Brownsville
peaker to Cinergy, but the work done by Mary in the SIP development process
which gained allocation of allowances to Enron assets proved to be valuable
in the sale.
Indiana:  Mary is working with EES to ensure allocation of allowances to
"energy efficiency" projects, which could prove to have value for EES and
customers.

Environmental Disclosure/Labeling:   as EES will be entering Ohio on 1/1/01
in First Energy's territory, Stacey Bolton met with the EES reporting team
concerned about the label.   Stacey suggested that since First Energy is
doing the billing function for EES' customers, EES lay off the disclosure
requirement on First Energy (First Energy will also be purchasing and
delivering the power).  EES is attempting to implement this suggestion.   EES
is also actively looking at CG&E territory and needs to prepare a disclosure
label.  As Ohio's disclosure rule is ambiguous, Stacey has been coordinating
questions w/ Ohio PUCO staff regarding disclosure requirements.

Renewable Energy/Wind:  Stacey is working with Enron Americas West Desk on
trading opportunities for wind energy in the west.  DOE is organizing a
trading platform for the Western States, and Stacey provided information to
EA and is helping develop a strategy to optimize their value for wind energy.

Pipeline Safety Legislation:    In Congress' last minute efforts to pass
appropriations bills, rumors have circulated that there may be an attempt to
attach pipeline safety legislation.   Jeff Keeler worked to gather more
information on these efforts, and found that support of many key
congressional leaders for such an effort is missing.  Jeff forwarded to ETS
and others a letter sent by Senator John McCain (a key pipeline safety
proponent) to congressional leaders) urging that pipeline legislation not be
included in any appropriations bills.

GREENFIELD CAPITAL PROJECTS


Cuiaba Pipeline (Bolivia/Brazil)- Joe Kolb will be participating with
Catherine McKalip-Thompson (Enron Corp) in conducting a "lessons learned"
analysis for the Cuiaba Project  and Transredes oil spill.

Lagos EPP (Nigeria) - Joe Kolb reports that the refurbishing and conversion
of the power barges is behind schedule.  The first one is expected to go
online in March of 2001 and the last in November 2001.

RioGen/Eletrobolt PPs (Brazil)- Joe Kolb has discussed with Lauren Goldblatt
(Enron Corp) the perspective he gleaned from his inspection of the proposed
CEG pipeline that will provide natural gas to the RioGen/Eletrobolt
projects.  Lauren is working with Enron SA to arrange a community meeting.

ACQUISITIONS

Project Crane (Quebec, Canada and Port Angeles, Washington Pulp and Paper
Acquisition) -  Susan Worthen was notified by Gustavo Junqueira (Industrial
Markets Finance Manager) that this transaction has been approved by the Board
and Enron is in the final stages of negotiating the Share Purchase Agreement
with the Seller.  The Port Angeles, Washington mill will be excluded due to
environmental liability issues.  Additional environmental due diligence is
currently being conducted on timber properties located near Quebec that are
harvested for construction lumber.  Mark Greenberg (Industrial Markets
Attorney) is the interface on the due diligence.  Gustavo, Susan, and Bob
Anderson (Pulp and Paper Technical) met to discuss the transition process and
on-going EHS support.  Susan also took the opportunity to raise questions
regarding budgets and acquisition strategy for 2001. She agreed to provide
transition plans for previous EI projects to use as ticklers of items that
need to be addressed, such as payroll, conversion of accounting systems, HR,
etc. and will meet with Henry Van and his group to discuss transition and
operating support plans.

Project INGA (California and Pennsylvania Power Plant Acquisition) - Don
Stevens provided an interpretation of the impact of EPA's announcement
regarding the control (regulation) of mercury emissions.

Massey (JV Coal Mine) - The scheduled site visit by Don Stevens was cancelled
by Massey due to disclosure concerns regarding current civil suits.  Massey's
executive management apparently questioned Enron's interest in the spill
since it is not directly associated with the property transaction currently
being pursued.  Susan Worthen notified the project team and RAC
representative of the current status and learned that this transaction will
not be concluded by the end of the year and additional time would be
available in January to visit these issues.

North Carolina CF Power Plants - Don Stevens reviewed the ENSR draft Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment, dated December 2000, and provided additional
questions.  ENSR is currently conducting a limit Phase II and the report
should be available by December 22, 2000.

ISAGEN - Don Stevens reviewed Harza's "Technical Review of ISAGEN Generating
Plants" and reported to  Mario Brunasso.  It has been reported that the
Finance Minister of Columbia said that legal loopholes, possible changes in
the price-tag for ISAGEN, and the need to update paperwork related to its
privatization would now postpone the deal until June 30, 2001.

Project Canary - Don Stevens reviewed Pilko & Associates Environmental Risk
Identification for the Celgar Pulp Company.  Susan Worthen provided an
Environmental Risk summary for the project team to use in the DASH.

will begin to promote the website on E-TV and also place a link to the site
on home.enron.com in the New and Notable section and in the Intranet Site
section.  Phase II planning is beginning. Phase II will contain streaming
video, an International Legislative and Regulatory Database, access to a
compliance management calendar and the remaining information from the
Environmental Strategies Group. Phase II role out still needs to be
determined and will be dependent on the availability of Enron Networks staff.

Telework/NEPI Program - Gavin Dillingham represented Enron at a meeting in
County Judge Eckels, office to discuss the National Telecommuting and Air
Quality Act with NEPI and the Philadelphia Steering Committee. Gavin is also
meeting with Elham Shirazi of NEPI and a representative from Enron,s
transportation group to discuss the possibility and feasibility of Enron
providing a Vanpool for its employees.

Lifecycle Process - Gavin Dillingham is continuing to work with Susan Worthen
and AD Little on determining Enron,s products and services for the lifecycle
study.  Financial market trading activities will be segregated from physical
market activities (those requiring a physical position in the market) and a
glossary of trading terms will be provided to make the document easier to
understand.  Additional refinements of the services will also be conducted to
streamline the inventory.

Asset Tracking Database - The database is currently being populated with
data. Susan Worthen will be following up on the revision of the asset list.

Annual EHS Report - Susan Worthen, Lauren Goldblatt, and Catherine
McKalip-Thompson discussed data needs for the 2000 annual report.  Lauren and
Susan met with Keith Micelli to gain insight on potential reporting issues
and contacts for Transredes and Cuiaba.  Lou Soldano and Susan Worthen agreed
to set up a meeting in early January to discuss EHS reporting of EOTT assets
with Frank Smith, Dave Nutt, and Bill Kendrick.
