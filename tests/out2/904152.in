Health & Fitness Tip of the Day

When You're Sidelined By Sickness

If you're pretty committed to your exercise routine, having a cold or the flu
makes you feel twice as bad because you suffer the added stress of missing
your workouts. Many athletes think that they should limit their food intake
during an "off" period, but depriving a recovering body from nutrition can
make healing take even longer. Sleep is another great healer, so be sure to
get at least eight hours a night when you're under the weather. Also, in a
desire to get healthier and drop excess weight, many people become
overzealous and lose weight too fast, often ending up sick, so play it smart
when trimming down.
