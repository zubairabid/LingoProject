The scenario outlined by Denis is consistent with advice previously provided
by the Tax group.
London based traders should be executing deals in the name of Enron
Credit.com  Ltd (not ENA.)
Houston based traders should be executing transactions in the name of ENA
(not Enron Credit.com Ltd).
Back to back transactions to transfer all positions to Enron Credit.com Ltd
will simplify financial and tax reporting if ENA will on a regular basis be
laying off positions acquired by Enron Credit.com Ltd. If ENA is simply
laying off positions acquired by ENA then strictly there is no need for the
back to back.
Assuming that all positions are in fact backed to Enron Credit.com Ltd an
agreed spread or fee will need to be awarded to ENA to compensate them for
their activity and risk assumed. Please note that Erica Gut and Mahesh
Lakhani will be providing tax support for the credit trading group in the
future and they will work with Denis to put the appropriate service
agreements/fee arrangements in place.
