How's it going? Fine I hope we are all o.k. It is finally cooling off a
little. It was awful this past week.
I heard you were in Cobo for the weekend. Did you have
fun. Paul called Monday and said you had gone.
So how are things going with you. I guess your busy.
What's new going on.
Talked to Sharon since they got back from their
honeymoon, they said they had a real good time the weather was wonderful.
Well all for now talk to
you soon..........Dad and I send our love
MOM
