PLEASE KEEP CONFIDENTIAL

FYRvw - Based on my notes, attached is an initial recap of individuals to be
included in "Accounting", and their current function. I have preliminarily
left gas accounting in accounting, and as discussed, left Clean Fuels out -as
a dotted line.

Please edit/comment as necessary.

I hope to work with Rod, Jerry and the Accounting Director team (Wiederholt,
Chandler, and Cobb) to finalize the organization.

Tracy and John K were going to work the Planning-side some more; and I will
also discuss the other issues mentioned, with Rod at the Management
conference.

Stay tuned...
