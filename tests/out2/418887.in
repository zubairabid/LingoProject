We have received a proposed assignment from PPL Corporation to PPL Energy
Plus, LLC wherein they would like to assign their financial transactions
(two), any guaranty relating thereto (do we have one covering financial?),
and any master agreement (we have no financial agreement with them).  Is this
OK with Credit?  I am having a copy of the assignment walked down to you.  If
someone else is going to approve this, let me know.
