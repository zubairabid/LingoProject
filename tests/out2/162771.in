Electricity,s Oktoberfest

Pennsylvania retail market survives summer and  grows
The latest shopping statistics on Pennsylvania,s market show  that as of
October 1, more customers than ever have switched to a competitive  supplier
in Pennsylvania. Up from the 528,000 customers that had switched by  July 1,
now more than 551,000 customers have chosen competitive suppliers. This
increase in customers that have switched is impressive given the unfavorable
summer wholesale market conditions. Even more impressively, in Duquesne Light,
s  service territory, 33% of residential customers have now switched.
Nineteen  suppliers are competing for residential customers in the PECO
service territory.  New Power entered the PECO market in September and is
aggressively advertising  and marketing, including offering frequent flyer
miles to its customers. Do not  expect that any of this good news will make
headlines around the country. But  count on those that support the California
approach to restructuring (they are  still peddling their snake oil) to keep
misrepresenting Pennsylvania,s electric  competition policy and bashing
Pennsylvania,s market.

Mack and ECAP re-enter the green market
The Energy  Cooperative Association of Pennsylvania (ECAP) and Mack Services
have re-entered  the green power market in the PECO Energy service territory,
offering a 100%  Green-e certified renewable energy product for 6.37
cents/kWh. A typical  residential consumer would pay a mere 14 cents more per
day to purchase a 100%  renewable power product from one of these suppliers.
Mack and ECAP join Green  Mountain Energy Company, which continued to accept
new customers throughout the  summer, as the three suppliers offering Green-e
products in the PECO area. Green  Mountain also has dropped the $3.95 per
month customer service charge in the  PECO service territory, thereby cutting
the cost of its 100% renewable energy  product by more than 10%. This is a
good time to switch to these attractive  renewable energy products, which
avoid an amount of pollution equal to not  driving 20,000 miles, taking 1.7
cars off the road, or planting 950 trees.  See our website at
www.pennfuture.org  for a switching kit.

New investment for Green Mountain
This week Green  Mountain Energy Company announced that it has received a
$53.5 million  investment from Nuon, the largest utility company in the
Netherlands. Nuon joins  BP Amoco with significant stakes in Green Mountain
Energy. Sam Wyly also  announced that he was resigning as the Chairman of
Green Mountain Energy,s Board  of Directors.

Hopefully the new investment and board membership are preludes to more
marketing activity in Pennsylvania for renewable energy products.

Adversity to triumph
In another striking development in  the renewable market, one of
Pennsylvania's early modern-era renewable  generators will most likely stay
in business, despite the recent ending of a  long-term PURPA contract. Since
1985, the Lebanon Methane Recovery project has  been operating effectively to
convert into electricity the landfill methane that  would have gone directly
into the atmosphere. After the 15-year PURPA contract  ended last year, the
facility was not able to sell its output in the PJM  wholesale market at
prices high enough to stay in business. Its closing was  imminent when
PennFuture was first contacted. The plant will likely now remain  open as
PennFuture arranged a project that will keep middleman expenses to a
minimum. The methane generator will sell directly to Mack Services Group, a
licensed wholesaler and retailer which will sell a 100% renewable Green-e
certified product to an aggregation of churches in the PECO service
territory.  By averting the shutdown of the facility, this project directly
avoids the  emission of methane * a greenhouse gas that is four times more
potent than  carbon dioxide (CO2). The generation of electricity from this
project also  produces approximately 141 fewer tons of nitrogen oxide, 472
tons less sulfur  dioxide, and 57,000 tons less CO2 than are emitted by the
generation of  average system power.

Lebanon Methane and Mack Services have agreed to price the transactions so
that a reasonable profit is made, while selling at a price that enables most
congregations to save as much as 10% off the price they would pay for mostly
coal and nuclear generation from PECO. Adding more small renewable
generators  and additional congregations may expand this project in the
future.

Allegheny Energy joining PJM?
Allegheny Energy,  operating in Pennsylvania, western Maryland, and West
Virginia, must by October  15th inform FERC and the Pennsylvania Public
Utility Commission (PUC)  about which Regional Transmission Organization or
Independent System Operator  that it will join. Important legislators like
Rep. Tulli and key regulators like  the PUC have been sending the
unmistakable message that Allegheny Energy would  be well advised to join
PJM. Last month, on the verge of briefing the PUC about  its ISO plans,
Allegheny Energy was told not to come to Harrisburg unless it was  going to
give two thumbs up on PJM. No car from Hagerstown, MD headed northeast  that
day. If Allegheny Energy does become part of PJM, Duquesne Light would
likely follow suit. Expanding PJM to cover western Pennsylvania is vital to
Pennsylvania,s economy and future. Encouragingly, officials in Harrisburg
increasingly understand the importance and urgency of this matter.
Hopefully,  Allegheny Energy also understands the determination to ensure
that PJM expands  to include western Pennsylvania.

Trouble blowing in the wind
Recently Allegheny Energy  was asked to provide the same energy scheduling
treatment for a proposed wind  farm in Fayette County that is accorded to a
similar wind farm now operating in  neighboring Garrett, Somerset County. The
Garrett wind farm is located within  PJM and its need for scheduling
treatment that reflects the intermittent nature  of wind power has been
accommodated by GPU and PJM. Allegheny Energy refused to  provide the same
treatment given to the Garrett facility and, as a result, has  certainly
delayed the project and put at risk the income to farmers, local tax
revenues, good jobs and clean energy which the nearly 15 megawatt wind farm
would create. The primary reasons Allegheny Energy gave for its refusal were
that its control area is too small and that it lacks a liquid spot market.
Guess  what? Both problems would vanish if Allegheny Energy joins PJM. The
only glimmer  of hope for avoiding an unfortunate regulatory fight is that
Allegheny Energy  said it would discuss this matter further after October
15th. Let,s hope for all  concerned that the ides of October bring glad
tidings.

Duquesne POLR II collaborative to begin October 14
The  recent decision by the Pennsylvania PUC to send the Duquesne POLR II
proceeding  to a collaborative commences with the first session October 14th.
The  collaborative is expected to wrap up in November. At stake is the most
ambitious  and successful retail choice transition of any EGS in the U.S.
(see E3, Vol. 2,  No. 18, Sept. 11). The Duquesne plan would increase present
shopping credits by  31% on a system average basis as well as provide a 17%
system average and 21%  residential rate cut for customers, whether or not
they are shopping. Between  the rate cut and savings from shopping,
residential customers may be able to  reduce their rates by 36% when compared
to those in effect prior to competition.  Among a host of other issues,
parties to the collaborative are now raising the  issue of Duquesne's
membership in PJM. Presumably, if Duquesne's transmission  assets are moved
into PJM, then Orion's generation bundle will also be in PJM.  If Allegheny
and First Energy were to join PJM, Duquesne's membership in PJM  would bring
all Pennsylvania generation mWs into the same ISO.

GPU)First Energy merger
In another ISO-related  decision, First Energy, part of the flawed Alliance
"ISO" filing, will file  their merger plans with FERC and the Pennsylvania
PUC this month. First Energy,  as a possible Alliance member, is not slated
to join a fully functioning ISO for  some time. The GPU merger gives First
Energy a chance to join PJM. This would  expand PJM,s geographic coverage to
Toledo, Ohio. Whatever the reason for First  Energy,s delay in joining PJM,
it is not for lack of cash flow or merger  synergies. First Energy,s
presentation to Wall Street on the GPU merger notes  that in their previous
merger, 1997's Ohio Edison-Centerior union, First Energy  promised synergies
of $1 billion and states that it has already delivered $700  million, with
$350 million/year in annual recurring savings. The presentation  tells only
half the story: First Energy's promise to the Ohio PUC in that merger  was to
join a functioning ISO. That promise now can be kept with First Energy
joining PJM.

Little known fact about PECO shopping credits
A recent  analysis of seven churches in the PECO service territory showed
that, because of  usage variations and the demand factor charge, shopping
credits ranged from 5.33  to 10.69 cents/kWh. Looks like a good opportunity
for savings in green  power.

ICAP update
As high as $350 mW/day, this past summer,s  ICAP prices were due
substantially to de-listing of capacity resources for sale  into neighboring
power pools. The de-listing of capacity resources can explain  why ICAP
prices skyrocketed this summer, when daily energy prices were lower  than
expected, as were year-ahead energy prices in the forward market. The  impact
of de-listing on prices and reliability was discussed in a recent PJM  Future
Adequacy Working Group (FAWG) meeting, where it was revealed that  de-listing
could have presented a problem had demand in PJM been consistently  high.
Despite the FAWG acronym, even with a north-Jersey accent there is no  cloud
in this group's direction: Most forward-looking participants expect that  the
de-listing market maneuver will be limited by a requirement that ICAP be bid
once or twice a year (with a daily market for changes in ICAP
responsibility).  This way, if a generation owner decides to de-list his
resource to chase higher  energy prices in other markets, the owner foregoes
ICAP for a full year or most  of the year (if the commitment period is
semi-annual as opposed to annual).  Beyond this fix for next summer, we
predict that the FAWG will embrace the  elimination of ICAP for 2002.
