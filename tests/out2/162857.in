In an effort to assist the IEP member companies in  closing out their fiscal
year accounts, IEP is attempting to reconcile its  Special Funds accounts
receivable/accounts payable. In the IEP Gas  Restructuring Special Fund
Account, IEP currently has an inbalance of  approximately $35,000. This
imbalance stems from work completed during  1999 and the first quarter of
2000 related to the gas restructuring  proceeding. You will recall, IEP has
active in developing an "IEP Vision"  on gas restructuring that was intended
to move the gas restructuring proceeding  forward. The Gas Restructuring
Task Force also  commissionedCrossborder, Inc. (Tom Beach)to conduct a
study of  theconvergence of the gas and electricity markets. The
"Convergence  Report"was circulated to the IEP Gas Restructuring Task Force
members in  the Spring of 2000.

The IEP Gas Restructuring Task Force is comprised  of the following companies:

Dynegy        c/o  Greg Blue
GWF         c/oDuane  Nelson
UAE         c/o  Darrell  Stoval
Williams Energy    c/o   Roger Pelote
Duke         c/o  Carolyn  Baker
FPLc/o   Steve Ponder
Enron C&T      c/o   Jeff Dasovich
PG&E  Generatingc/oBevin  Hong

On a pro rata basis, IEP will invoice each of the  companies listed above for
approximately $4,000 to cover the difference between  commitments received to
date and actual expenses incurred. Please contact  me if you have any
questions or comments. The invoices are expected to be  in the mail by the
end of next week.
