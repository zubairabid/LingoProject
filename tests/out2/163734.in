Mary,
Can we tone down the demand-side management language.  Our short-term retail
position in California is that the rate freeze by law should be maintained
until December 31, 2002.  Of course, in the long-run we believe demand-side
management and demand elasticity is and important tool toward managing the
prices in California.  Perhaps you can refer to demand elasticity as a
long-run goal or focus your discussions on demand elasticity with respect to
the utilities' current tools in their interruptible tariffs.  Also, you could
focus more on the utilities' new ability to purchase outside the PX.  I am
afraid that coming out too strong on demand-side management as a short-run
solution plays into the utilities' hands to end the rate freeze early to the
detriment of the retail market.
