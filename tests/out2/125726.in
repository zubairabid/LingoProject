Janet,
I have reviewed the attached contract and it gives me a lot of concern.
First brush, it is one sided in their favor and offers us no breakage
protection.  Specifically,
Section 4.4 --- HPL should be the confirming party.
Section 4.5 --- HPl also needs to have the right to call for security.
Clause should be balanced.
Section 5.5a -- "its best efforts" should be changed to "commercially
reasonable efforts".
Sections 5.8 & 5.9 --  Need clauses addressing "undertakes by Buyer" and
"overtakes by Buyer".
Section 6.3b --  20 days should be changed to 15 days in each location in
this section.
Section 6.4 ---  Needs a lot of explanation.  Why is it here?  Why would we
agree to such?
Article 10 - Force Majeure -  Need to add Enron language as to items which
are not force majeure.
Article 11 - Default -  Need to add additional Triggering Events, Early
Termination, and Termination Damage provisions.
Also, need to add provisions for limitation of liability and waiver of
consequential damages.

Let me know how you would like to proceed.  I do not think that they will
agree to make any of the changes we would need to do the deal.  Would they be
willing to contract using the GISB form of agreement?
