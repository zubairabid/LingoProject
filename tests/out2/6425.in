Jeff:



I was intrigued by your interview in the 10/30/00 issue of InternetWeek
Onlineas we seem to share the desire to transform the system. Despite Enron,
s better business model, robust software infrastructure is as critical to
Enron,s success as for any other Fortune 1000 company. Should you agree with
our mission to deliver that infrastructure, we would be most honored to have
you join our Advisory Board (includes stock option compensation).



SEADE Software is developing a new category of software we call an
Application Deployment Engine (ADE). I stress that this is a new category of
software. The ADE shares some of the features of several existing
categories), but no existing product, or combination of products, has
thepotential of having such a profound, disruptive affect on the process of
developing complex, enterprise-scale eBusiness software. The ADE enables
rapid deployment of feature-rich, secure, scaleable, open-platform,
best-of-breed eBusiness software in &Internet Time8. In addition, it
provides for better and more cost effective life cycle management and
integration of that software. Note that the SEADE team has previously built
the ADE three times as the framework for specific vertical applications.



While this is a new category of commercial software, it,s not a particularly
new idea. What we are doing has in fact always been the way the academic
world has said complex software systems should be written. The evolution
from structured languages, to object orientation has been a continual effort
to find a means to leverage the effort and resources used to deploy past
applications for the deployment of the next application. Most enterprise
software shares between 60-90% of its core foundation and features with all
other software. We call these common horizontal components the &Common
Horizontal Framework8,of a custom application. The vertical components are
the parts that make the software valuable enough to risk the resources to
develop and deploy mission critical applications.



SEADE Software,s core competency is the delivery of the horizontal components
that make up the majority of all business applications. We deliver this in a
highly customizable, component-based, platform-independent, fully
internationalized, pre-fabricated software application we call an ADE. The
ADE enables fast-tracked development of new integrated eBusiness applications
and provides a common reference for legacy Enterprise application integration
(many-to-many EAI). We empower the Fortune 1000 to maximize their core
competency by leveraging ours.



I,ve attached for your review our Executive Summary, Business Case Slideshow
pitch, and Advisory Board bios. Please let me know if you find our offer of
interest. Thank you for your consideration.





Best regards,
Scott
