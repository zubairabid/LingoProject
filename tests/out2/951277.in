Hi Greg!

Here is the information regarding the Dec 13th event at Wharton.  Wharton is
beside itself with excitement at your acceptance, and communicated that with
Jeff Skilling at his visit there this past Thursday.

They're also very interested in discussing their WeBI program with you and
would like to arrange to do that the day of your evening presentation, or
perhaps the following day, whichever suits your schedule.  This was also
discussed with Jeff Skilling--he is clearly interested in the program, but
will be especially looking to your input, along with that of Vince Kaminski,
Jeff Shankman and me, in determining Enron's decision to participate.  As I
mentioned previously, Vince, Jeff and I think Enron's involcvement with WeBI
holds very positive potential. Financially, it involves a contribution of
$250,000 for 4 years.

Please see the request for your "Bio" and desired inclusion of program
materials, as well as the contact at Wharton, toward the end of the message
below.

Let me know by eMail or voice mail (3-6117) how University Affairs can
further these efforts.

Thanks!

--Christie.
