Bill, during HE 17  IID had a 130 MW  Firm in the scrape and in the model.
When checking out with IID they stated they had 120 MW only.  In speaking
with Joe at  IID they stated that  they spoke with Tony at 14:13 PST and told
him to put in 120 for HE 17 and 18 MST.  I agreed to check out with their
number as it appears that there was a miscommunication between IID, Tony,
and David (who was working during that shift).  You may want to ask Tony when
he comes in if he recalls this conversation.  Thank you for your attention to
this matter.
