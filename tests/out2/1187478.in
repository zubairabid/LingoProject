Tana,
State of incorporation has been captured for a large number of the
counterparties and has been used as the basis for the determination of
financial trading status by our tax group.
If we are going to prevent a utility/gov/pension fund from trading financial
products because of state law and we have state of incorporation, we should
ensure that the entity we are barring is at least in the same state as the
law in question.
If this has not been the case, one way to update the information would be to
list the states which have restrictive legislation and then apply the list to
the companies for which we have state of incorporation information. An Excel
Vlookup would accomplish this quite quickly. This is not perfect, but would
at least ensure that utilities in states without the legislation are not
barred - although I recognize it might bar some companies in states where the
legislation may be so specific as not to preclude the trading of financial
products for some utilities under certain circumstances.
Frank: Could you please forward an updated list of state of incorporation
information to Tana?
One last point (thanks, Bob): If a particular state has restrictive
legislation, is it our obligation to prevent the utility from trading
financial products, or does the obligation rest with the utility? i.e. is
there any reason for us to be barring them, or can we simply give them the
ability to transact financial products with EnronOnline and rely on their
internal controls? If we don't have any legal obligation to police, I'm
reluctant to do anything which would imply we are assuming this
responsibility.
Mark: Can you comment on this last point?
Thanks,
Dave
