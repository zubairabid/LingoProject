I have been sitting on the amendment you drafted which was to add several
city gates while removing others as part of the Rosenburg transition.  Since
we cannot find economic support for the Pheasant Creek City Gate, please
delete this from your draft (to be effective 10/1/99) and resubmit to me for
execution.  Upon Entex's execution of the Bill of Sale on Rosenburg, which we
have been waiting for their comments for several weeks, we will then be
prepared to execute this revised amendment.  Jim, can you prompt up Entex's
response to the Bill of Sale so we can move this along?
