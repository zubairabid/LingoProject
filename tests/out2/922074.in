Thanks for the update.  I am glad that you and Fernley were able to get
together.

Let me know what you hear from Mark or Tim about their discussion.  When that
is set, I will put out a memo that outlines the changes that we are making as
Scott Pleus devotes full time to EBS.

Hope your weekend was a good one.  Have you seen Brent yet?  --Sally
