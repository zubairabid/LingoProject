Player UpdatesNBA Reports
Latest NBA Player News Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00The
Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primarily as
Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value.  Chris Dudley , C PHO -
Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Dudley was activated from the injured list and
started in Thursday's game at Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center,
Dudley could be of good use in a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in
a smaller one.    Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Garces
was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.  Garces is
suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily as a third
center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.  Donyell Marshall , F UTA -
Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Marshall had missed the two games prior to
Thursday's action because of a sprained knee, but returned to the lineup
against Vancouver and had seven points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.
Because Marshall comes off the bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But
with him back in the rotation forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will
play less minutes now.     Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated
12/08/00Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained
knee.  He is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence
will force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have
positive or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston
frontcourt players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or
flounder under the current conditions.    Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent
Updated 12/08/00Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room
for the injured Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive
enough playing time to be a valuable Fantasy player.     Greg Buckner , G DAL
- Free Agent Updated 12/08/00Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to
remove a cracked bone spur on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline
Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rookie Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured
list to make room for Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he
has been sidelined with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner
for he rest of the season or until he is playing and producing on a
consistent basis again.     Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated
12/08/00Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to
return to the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.
"Oak," who was suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has
Fantasy value as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity
outside of deeper leagues.    Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated
12/08/00Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as
though Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden
State Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting
about the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the very
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.
Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00Hill was a game time scratch on
Thursday night against the Nuggets. The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that
Hill is expected to return to the court on Monday when the Magic travel to
Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers. Hill's return is long overdue for
Fantasy owners who held onto his rights this season. Unless you have a number
of solid forwards on your roster, give Hill the start this week pending any
setbacks.    Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Turkoglu
is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for Friday's game
against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but has very little
Fantasy value.     Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Nash
returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two straight
games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by the injury
as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is now safe to
play Nash on your Fantasy team again.     Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free
Agent Updated 12/07/00Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is
questionable for Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters
Bryon Russell and Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid
using Marshall until he appears to be fully recovered.    Kevin Garnett , F
MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00Garnett hurt his right ring finger in
Tuesday's game and was scheduled to have it examined Wednesday.  He is
expected to play against the Wizards Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.
Something as simple as an injured finger on his shooting hand could lead to
an offensive slump and affect his Fantasy numbers.    Terry Davis , F DEN -
Free Agent Updated 12/07/00Davis will be eligible to come off the injured
list Sunday but Achilles tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him
sidelined a little bit longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his
career and doesn't have much Fantasy value.    Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The
Rounders Updated 12/07/00McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's
game against the Heat and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the
Magic.  Keon Clark will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.
The leg is sore now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few
days.    Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00Hill may be ready to
return to the court for Thursday night's game against the Nuggets. He has
missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he practiced on
Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court. "I can't give
you the official thumbs up," said Head Coach Doc Rivers, "but it looks good."
Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will likely get him
back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a four-game West Coast
road trip.   Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00According to The
Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful that Trent will
travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing on the East Coast.
Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but could be back in action
in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the first preseason game
with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a good inside scorer and a
solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does return Fantasy owners
should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately need a forward.
Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00Marbury missed
his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of an ankle injury. He
turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turned it again the
following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is still lacking
some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankle is
diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host the
Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have their
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes.  Vince Carter ,
G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Carter was in uniform for Wednesday
night's game against Portland, but he didn't see any playing time. "Air
Canada" said that he felt well enough to play, but team doctors wouldn't give
him permission to get in the game. "We'd like to have him back as soon as
possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens, "but we're not going to bring him
back before he's ready." Toronto finishes their three-game West Coast swing
on Friday night against Golden State, at which time Carter hopes to make his
return. The Raptors' star should be back before Monday, so most Fantasy
owners can re-insert him into their lineup in time for next week.    Andre
Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00Miller took a knee to the nose
during Wednesday night's game at Chicago which sent him to the bench
temporarily. He returned to the game with a vengeance, finishing with 20
points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot
to the nose won't keep Miller from missing any playing time, so continue to
use the young point guard in your starting lineup.    Elton Brand , F CHI -
Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00Brand missed his second consecutive game on
Wednesday night against Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his
hyperextended left knee, and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.
Brand is listed as day to day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance
of playing on Friday night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring
on Monday, Fantasy owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their
lineup for next week's games.   Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated
12/06/00The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes.
Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Dudley will travel with the
Suns on their end of the week road-trip that starts in Milwaukee Thursday.
He will most likely be questionable for all the games.  Look for him to
finally return to action next week.  With Dudley out of the lineup Corie
Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to get playing time.  With
the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding makes him a starter on your
Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his position.    Chris Mills , F
GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game
against the Lakers because of pain in his right ankle.  He was scheduled to
see a foot specialist on Tuesday and underwent surgery last season to remove
bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mills on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you
are playing in a small league drop him from your roster and add another
forward.     Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00Mercer
sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu.  Corey
Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's status for
Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment so far
this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your roster,
if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The way Mercer
has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a better guard.
Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Williams sprained his
ankle in Tuesday's game against the Grizzlies and is questionable for
Wednesday's contest at Seattle.  The ankle will probably limit Williams'
production in the next few games so use a healthy forward instead.    Billy
Owens , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Owens strained his right biceps in
Tuesday's game against Vancouver.  He has actually been productive this
season when healthy, but don't gamble on him.  Owens has been injury prone
throughout his career and is too risky a player to take a chance on.  Use a
more durable player instead.     Joe Smith , F DET - Free Agent Updated
12/06/00Smith got his first start as a Piston Tuesday at power forward.  He
scored 12 points and grabbed eight rebounds.  With his promotion into the
starting lineup it is now safe to start Smith on your Fantasy team.  With an
increased role Smith will be a consistent rebounder and scorer.    John
Wallace , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00Wallace was placed on the
injured list due to tendonitis in his left knee.  He is a good offensive
player but his shortcomings on defense have limited his playing time.  His
lack of playing time prevents him from being a productive Fantasy player so
avoid using him in your league     More Updates

Player NewsTeams
Farragut Academy Player News Lamar Odom , Reserve FUpdated 10/26/00Head coach
Alvin Gentry is considering playing Odom at the point guard position. This
move would allow Gentry to play swingmen Darius Miles, Eric Piatkowski, Corey
Maggette, Quentin Richardson, and Tyrone Nesby more frequently. Odom played
point guard last season and is an exceptional ballhandler for his size. The
shift for Odom is expected to begin Friday when he suits up for the preseason
finale against Seattle. Odom had missed four consecutive preseason games due
to a bruised left quadriceps.  Kenyon Martin , Reserve FUpdated 10/25/00Nets'
Head Coach Byron Scott sat Martin down this week and insisted that he step up
his game on a nightly basis. The talk may have worked, as Martin scored 14
points and collected 11 rebounds in 33 minutes of work, but the Nets still
fell to the Knicks, 91-80.  Darius Miles , Injured FUpdated 11/16/00Miles did
not play in Wednesday's game against the Knicks. Head coach Alvin Gentry
chose to go with a more experienced lineup and started Tyrone Nesby at
shooting guard. Keep and eye on this situation. This could lead to a
diminished role for Miles.  Larry Hughes , Active GUpdated 10/16/00Shooting
guard Larry Hughes displayed his athleticism Sunday against Portland by
scoring 16 points and grabbing 10 rebounds. Don't hesitate to select Hughes
in the middle rounds of your Fantasy draft. This 21-year old is extremely
talented.  Michael Olowokandi , Reserve CUpdated 10/19/00Starting center
Michael Olowokandi will sit out Thursday's preseason game against the Nuggets
to rest his sore ankle. Camp invitee Zendon Hamilton will get a chance to
prove his worth to the club as he slides into the starting spot in place of
Olowokandi.  Travis Best , Active GUpdated 10/24/00Best returned to the floor
for the first time this preseason on Monday night, and proceeded to have a
huge game for the Pacers. He scored 19 points, dished out seven assists and
collected five rebounds in 40 minutes of play. He will be Indiana's starting
point guard when the season opens on October 31st.  Shawn Bradley , Active
CUpdated 11/02/00Bradley will replace Christian Laettner in the starting
lineup at center for Thursday's game. Head coach Don Nelson was impressed
with Bradley's effort in the season opener in which he scored six points
grabbed five rebounds and had six blocks in 20 minutes.  Sam Cassell ,
Reserve GUpdated 03/02/00Cassell had a night to forget. He had 8 points and 8
assists on 2-of-10 shooting.  Danny Fortson , Reserve FUpdated
11/23/00Fortson had successful surgery on his broken right foot Wednesday,
and will be sidelined for at least two months. He had been leading the NBA in
rebounding when he suffered the injury, and was placed on the injured list
November 15. His rehabilitation program will consist of an immobilization of
the foot for about eight weeks, after which point he will enter the final
phase of recovery. Fortson will likely not return to the Warriors until after
the All-Star break.  Kevin Garnett , Active FUpdated 12/07/00Garnett hurt his
right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to have it examined
Wednesday. He is expected to play against the Wizards Thursday. Monitor
Garnett's situation. Something as simple as an injured finger on his shooting
hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his Fantasy numbers.  Tracy
McGrady , Reserve GUpdated 11/30/00McGrady returned to action on Wednesday
night after missing two games with an infected hand. He played the game with
his hand wrapped in a bandage, but it didn't effect his production. The
Orlando star scored 28 points and pulled down seven boards in losing to Utah
88-86. McGrady should continue to be a Fantasy stud as the NBA season
progresses.  Jermaine O'Neal , Active FUpdated 11/29/00O'Neal was held out of
the starting lineup because he was late for a team plane Monday. He had
started his team's first 12 games. He still managed to post another
double-double, scoring 17 points and grabbing 11 rebounds. O'Neal should be
back in the starting lineup for Thursday's game at Golden State.  Jalen Rose
, Active GUpdated 11/20/00Rose his hoping to make his season debut on Tuesday
night against the Rockets, but he's not making any promises. He was suppose
to return to action last week, but the team's medical personnel advised him
to wait a bit longer before hitting the court. If Rose is on your roster,
give him at least another week before putting him into your starting lineup.
