Sara,
Procter & Gamble has proposed that we start negotiating using their ISDA
schedule.  Enclosed is a note (that addresses a few critical issues) from my
business counterpart and a draft schedule.
P&G is the largest buyer of pulp and containerboard in North America - two
key commodities for our business.  Executing a Master with them is very
important.  If at all possible, I would like to accomodate their requests to
negotiate from their schedule.
However, as you know, I am not a lawyer.  Please review and share your
thoughts with me.  Thanks.
