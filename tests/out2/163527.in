As you are aware, IEP has endured a number of staff  changes over the past
few months, primarily in the accounting/office management  functions. As a
result, we have been delinquent in sending invoices to  member companies for
their dues and/or special fund commitmentsmade during  the year 2000.
However, we also have been modifying our accounts payable  (AP) and accounts
receivable (AR) procedures, essentially shifting the tracking  of these
accounts to our external accountant.

Accordingly, our external accountant (Dan Ross  Accountancy) will be sending
invoices to IEP members for outstanding dues and/or  special fund commitments
which have yet to be paid. Some of these amounts  may be for commitments
last spring. We ask your indulgence as we become  current. Some
commitments/checks may have slipped through the cracks  during this period.

We thank you for your patience and prompt response  to the invoices you will
be receiving in the near future. Upon receipt of  these invoices, if you
have any questions, you may contact Ann Ross  (IEP's external accountant) at
916/635-1424 or me.
