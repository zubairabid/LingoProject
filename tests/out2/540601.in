Sarah,
Thanks to you and Jennifer for arranging.   I will be in attendance at 3:00
pm and have asked either Jim Crowder or Everett Plante to also attend.   I do
not know their availability yet due to the Enron PRC meeting conflicts.   Is
it possible for me to attend starting at 1:00 pm - I have not been through a
complete Experience Enron meeting ?
thanks again for your help.
