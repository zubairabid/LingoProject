Boondoggle ??????
My fingers are bare to the bone, the blood is oozing out of them.......I have
been typing my- watootsie off -reviewing counterparty's, oh gotta run, the
Queen is calling me for lunch.
Ahh I am back, she is such a suite lady...
Regarding the Keyspan issue, I received a request from Maureen Smith about a
month ago to set up a GISB with ENA and these Ravenswood entites.  At the
same time they sent us a guaranty which ENA -Physical Legal was reviewing,
this is the first I have heard they want to transact financially.  Ravenswood
is a CoGen facility that operates in New York City, I am assuming they want
to buy gas to operate the plant and hedge the gas at the same time.  KeySpan
Corp is the holding company, and also owns two regualted utilities that serve
the NY metro area, one of which is Brooklyn Union Gas ( now named KeySpan
Energy Delivery).  I am fine with these Ravenswood trading financially as
long as they meet the ESP requirements, and becuase they will be guaranteed
by KeySpan Corp I am assuming they will.  Also, regarding KeySpan Energy
Management, that guaranty includes KeySpan Energy Services as well but only
cover Physical transactions.  I don't see any need, at this time, to include
them on this Ravenswood guaranty as we have not exposure their at all.
