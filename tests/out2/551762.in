for someone who isn't into their birthday you sure are stretching out this
celebration.  it is about as long as mardi gras.  830 isn't too late for me.
i will be there with bells on.  when you become an adult, as i am, sometimes
you get a little more tired.  and if you have to be at work at 7 am rather
than 9 you get a little more tired.  where did your brother take you?
