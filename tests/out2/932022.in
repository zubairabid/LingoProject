We got back from Dallas yesterday about 5:00 and it was a fun and very
fruitful trip for the team.
Schools are categorized by size - small, medium, large and super.  Klein is
super-sized.  The Bearkadettes won first place and the grand champion trophy
in the super category.  Best in Category awards are given for each category
of team dance entered, regardless of school size.  Klein won best in category
for all four team dances entered - kick, pom, military and jazz - a clean
sweep.  Klein also had the first place winner in the solo category and first
place in the duet category.  Also won first place in officer dances for super
sized schools.  They also won two special judges awards - not given out every
time, but only when the judges want to especially recognize achievements.
They got a special judges award for Creativity and Originality (commentary on
both our fabulous costumes made by a group of Bearkadette moms and the
choreography) and a special judges award for Perfect Score (a score of 100
awarded by all 3 judges for a particular routine - apparently very rare).
The Perfect Score award was for their pom routine, where they are dressed
like penguins (one of the ones that Meagan was in).  The girls were pretty
excited and the moms were cheering a lot, too.  They all work so hard and
spend so many hours practicing that it is nice to see that pay off!!

I am ordering the video from competition, so we can show you the routines
sometime.

I had a lot of fun.  The girls are cute and I enjoyed getting to know some of
the moms who were chaperoning as well.  But it was nice to get back to
Houston yesterday.
