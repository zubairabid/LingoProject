Houston vs. Texas
Men's Basketball - Wednesday, December 20
Hofheinz Pavilion at 7 p.m.

Tickets available at 713 GO COOGS

Come out to the UH vs UT basketball game on 12/20/2000.  We need to get a
bunch of Cougars there to alleviate the effect of the ridiculous amount of UT
fans that come out.

94.5 The Buzz will be at the game collecting new teddy bears and
blankets for their Santa's Letters promotion.  Any fan donating an item to
Santa's Letters will have the opportunity to upgrade their seats to floor
seats and one lucky winner will win a suite to a future game.  So please
help a family in need this holiday by bringing a new blanket or teddy bear
to the game.

Get out there and stop December madness!!
