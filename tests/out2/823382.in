Hey Guys and Girls,

Here's an idea for an icebreaker activity for our  2nd week of NEON. This is
only an idea, you can use it or do something  totally different. Again, let
me know along the way if you have something  that has worked well for your
group so we can share in the wealth.

Someone in your group should have a couple of  classic books full of
icebreaker-game type of activities, Building Community  in Youth Groups, and
Youth Group Trust Builders. We all at  one time had a selection of
icebreakers in a gray binder that you might still  have somewhere in a
drawer. Spend time in the games and forced  interactions, especially over
the beginning of the semester. If you don't  have these resources, let me
know. Even if some of these ideas may seem  familiar to you, remember that
you may have been doing this far longer than the  oldest kids have been in
your group.But again, if you have any ideas for  resources let me know.

In addition to the ideas to think about at the top  of the 2nd weeks topic, a
couple of additional thoughts given me by  leaders:
-Realize and possibly  communicate in a low key manner to the freshman
that their expectations of NEON  may not initially be met. They may be
coming in with ideas of what NEON  is, only to possibly be disappointed. In
a sense it is similar to going to  a restaurant or movie after tons of people
have recommended it to you, and being  a little let down. More importantly,
they need to realize that NEON is not  an event, it is a process. The teens
who say they love it are most often  the ones who have been in it long enough
to have built relationships and to have  shared a bunch of common
experiences. With time and a commitment on their  part to be at NEON weekly,
their expectations will ultimately be  met.
-Remember that the best quality  time you have with the kids is probably
before or after NEON, or at other  non-NEON times.

Have fun loving on your kids  Wednesday!
