Nick,

I understand that they terminated their agreement.  However, I don't feel
that we can confiscate their production.  We need to either pay them for the
gas, or cut a deal to redeliver a like volume to them at another meter.
Given the decrease in prices from September to current and prompt month, I
would guess that they want to be paid.  We won't know that until we call
them.  I don't know where the responsibility lies as far as calling to
explain to them that we took delivery of their gas until the meter was
shut-in.

Please let me know if I can do anything further to assist.

Mary
