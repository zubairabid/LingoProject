Vince,
Thank you for forwarding the following messages.  I am sorry that I am just
now getting back to you, my lotus notes was down all afternoon yesterday.
We currently have the Cal Berkeley General Presentation set for Wednesday,
October 18th at 7:00 p.m. which works out well because it is just prior to
the time deadline for students to submit their resumes.  The General
Presentation is a general overview of Enron, the Program, the interview
process, as well as a chance for students to meet and chat with Enron reps.
Since this is the first year that we are recruiting from Cal Berkeley, I
think that it is important that I attend this event on campus so that I can
answer any interview process questions.  I will check the schedule and see if
it is possible to move the presentation to the 23rd.  The only negative is
that I will not be able to attend because I will be conducting interviews at
Rice that day.  Also, it is very difficult to find a location to hold the
presentation, and I need to check on location availability on the 23rd.
However, I do think that we should take advantage of the seminar on campus.
This may mean that they are two seperate trips to campus.  Perhaps, we can
also set up some other presentations for the 23rd or even the Monday prior.
Although I would like to be able to attend the class/seminar presentations, I
don't think that it is as vital as the General Presentation.
What are your thoughts?
