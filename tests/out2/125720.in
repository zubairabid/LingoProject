Russell,
Regarding their first point, we should only guarantee amounts that are
covered by our contracts.  Non contract amounts should not be subject the the
guarantee, incoming or outgoing.
Remember that we need to keep the guaranty amounts specific as to each enron
entity.  This is because the part that pertains to Houston Pipe Line Company
will need to be deleted from the guaranty and a separate guaranty from HPL's
new parent will need to take its place.
Somehow we need them to accept buyin on the fact that the new guarantee will
not be effective until the old guaranty has been superceded, even if this
takes the action of their spun off entity.
Clement,
Do you agree?
