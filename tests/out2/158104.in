The Enron Europe legal department has grown steadily over the five years
since Enron,s merchant business was introduced into the UK in 1995 and
continues to grow, currently comprising some thirty lawyers in four
countries. In order to align the legal department as closely as possible with
Enron Europe's business units, to streamline the management of the department
and to clarify for all which lawyers within the department specialise in
which areas of Enron Europe,s activities, the following new groups within the
department will be created with effect from Tuesday 2nd January 2001, each
reporting to myself as General Counsel:

Asset Management and Origination / EES

Headed by Jon Chapman, this group will deal with all legal work relating to
Enron Europe,s existing and future asset positions (which include the TPL,
ETOL, Trakya, Sarlux and Nowa Sarzyna power stations and the Arcos project),
Enron,s retail power business: Enron Direct throughout Europe, and all EES
business. This group will also handle human resource related matters.
Reporting to Jon will be Alan Black, Sarah Gregory, Chris Wood, Stephan
Dewald, Stephen Hands, Tim Underdown (in his TPL legal capacity) and Annette
Patrick.

Finance / Continental Trading and Origination

Marcus Von Bock will head this group which will deal with Enron Global
Finance transactions (monetisation, securitisation and capital market related
transactions) and all gas and power origination and trading matters
throughout continental Europe. Mark Elliott, Martin Rosell, Michael Schuh and
Michael Slade will report to Marcus.

Technology and Global Markets

Justin Boyd will head this group which will deal with all European work
relating to all of Enron,s internet based trading platforms, including Enron
OnLine, Enron Credit.com and Clickpaper.com. This group will also handle all
Enron Global Markets, work in Europe, including weather, currency, equity,
interest rate, FX, and commodity derivatives, crude and products, coal,
emissions, LNG and paper and pulp trading. Robert Quick, Rahul Saxena, Ian
Brungs and Lorna Jones will report to Justin.

UK Energy/Credit/Metals

Paul Simons will head this group which will deal with all UK power and gas
trading and origination transactions (including the effort to amend existing
power contracts to ensure their viability in the new bilateral trading
market) all metals and softs related work and work originated by Enron
Credit.com. Adam Duguid, Denis O,Connell, Ed Cooper and Matt Dawson will
report to Paul.

As before:

- the Broadband Services Group continues to be headed by Mary Nell Browning
reporting to myself and to Kristina Mordaunt (General Counsel Enron Broadband
Services) in Houston;

- the Company Secretarial Group continues to be headed by Sue Kelly reporting
to me. Cindy Buckley reports to Sue; and

- the Regulatory Group continues to be headed by Jonathan Marsh, reporting to
me. Jon Barrett and Julie Russell report to Jonathan.

A chart showing the new structure is attached for your information.

This restructing of the group will inevitably result in some work being
transitioned from the lawyer currently responsible to lawyers within the
appropriate group. This will be achieved gradually over time (beginning Q1
2001) so as to prevent any disruption to ongoing transactions.

Please join me in congratulating Jon, Marcus, Justin and Paul on their
expanded roles.
