I sent an e:mail message yesterday saying that I could make dinner in Austin
on Wednesday, October 25.  That date does not work for me now.  I need to
attend a get together for the CommodityLogic team that evening, that was just
set up today.  As of last week, I am now co-leading CommodityLogic (under
Enron Networks) along with Tom Gros.  This is in addition to my role within
ENA.  As a new lead over the group, it is important for me to join the team
for their team building next Wednesday.

Let me know whether or not you have enough takers for dinner in Austin next
week.  If you are short, let me know and I will see what I can do on another
night that week.  --Sally
