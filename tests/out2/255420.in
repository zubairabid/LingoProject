Stan,

I have worked with Lawrence over the past three years while he was working
with Aquila.  As you know, Aquila is a major trading partner of ENA.
Lawrence and I have had numerous meetings/discussions related to credit risk
management and overall corporate credit exposures between ENA and Aquila.  My
initial feedback on Lawrence is that he has developed a good grasp of high
level apects associated with trading operations.  He is very attentive to the
detailed aspects of capturing and reporting risks and appears to be a vocal
and demanding leader.  My only concern is that in some of our past
negotiations he did not seem to be as flexible and innovative as Enron would
typically would like.  I am not sure it that is an issue with his style or if
that is a reflection on Aquila.

I don't know your expectations of Lawrence in the CFO role for EOTT, but I do
believe he has the ability and confidence to provide value to their
operations.

Regards,
Bill
