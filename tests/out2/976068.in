April, I'll be in Colorado until March 10.  We can schedule next week or you
can talk to him directly.  Currently, EBS research is helping Kevin Howard
and Scott Yeager (indirectly via Kevin) in their effort to assess the value
of an eyeball.  Paulo's research will complement this effort.  The research
that Paulo will perform for you will be part of a bigger picture work that
Kevin Howard has aked Stinson and I to support.    You can call me on my cell
713-516-5440 while I am in CO.

Regards,

Ravi.
