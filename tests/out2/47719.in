Group,

California has asked us to swing energy up from NOB around to COB...We do
this by using the following account #'s.
1. The CISO provides us with energy at NOB
2.  We then use BPA(t) to take it to SNOPUD-BPA account #682840
3.  We do a buy/resale with SNOPUD for $25
4.  SNOPUD gives us the energy at their system and we take it to PGE at John
Day- BPA account #840542
5.  We use PGE direct from John Day down to the CISO.
6.  We collect $150 from the CISO for the service.

Phone numbers are:
BPA(t):9-1-360-418-2581
SNOPUD:9-1-425-304-1620
PGE(t):8650

The CISO would like to be able to call upon this when PATH 15 problems occur
and they are in an emergency situation.
When the CISO asks, please put this deal in as early as possible, and then be
sure to check out closely with all counterparties including the CISO at NOB
and COB.

As always, please ask me if you have any questions.  I can be reached on my
cell phone at 503-887-3889.

Thank you,

Bill
