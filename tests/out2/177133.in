Shelley,
Since Steve and Kevin are out, I'll wade in here.  The TW Red Rock expansion
is for 150,000 Dth/d.  It is a mainline expansion, allowing Transwestern to
flow west from receipt points East of Thoreau to the California border.  As
you recall, we held an open season in November for an [undefined] expansion
to the system.  Customers were encouraged to define volumes/price/path in
their expressions of interest.  As you'd expect, we received wide-ranging
expressions of interest for various locations/term lengths/paths/pricing.
After months of work to define the most economical project for TW, we were
able just this week to go back to the original open season respondents and
define the project for them.  We've given them until March 2 to provide us
with a binding bid for capacity in the expansion.  We'll look at those bids
once they're received and sort/allocate them [in the event volumes bid exceed
150,000] according to our tariff.   We've identified what receipt and
delivery point capacities are available for customers on the expansion.
There is no capacity available for deliveries to SoCal Gas at Needles.  We
expect gas to be delivered to PG&E, Southwest Gas and the two new power
plants recently constructed off TW at the Cal. border.
In my view, and I think a view shared by many, is that there really isn't
[necessarily] a lack of upstream interstate capacity.  Rather, the bigger
obstacle to meeting growing gas demand in [Southern] California are the
physical and regulatory bottlenecks in the California utility systems.  For
example, SoCal Gas has a physical bottleneck coming off TW into its Line 235
that limits TW to 750,000 Mcf/d sustainable capacity.  With the addition of a
modest horsepower increase at the SoCal Gas receiving station, they could
easily take another 150,000 Mcf/d off TW.  Similar bottlenecks exist into
SoCal Gas Line 3000 system off EPNG at Topock, as well as the interconnect
with PG&E and Kern/Mojave at Wheeler Ridge.  The Line 225 takeaway capacity
from Wheeler Ridge is rated only at 680,000 Mcf/d.  PG&E and Kern/Mojave
could easily deliver over 1 Bcf/d.  The problem at Wheeler Ridge will only be
exacerbated if both PG&E and Kern are successful in building expansions to
their systems.  The clearest description of this problem I've ever heard came
from Jeff Dasovich.  Jeff likened the interstate pipelines serving California
to "an interstate highway system that ends in a dirt road."  The gas
transmission infrastructure in California has been sorely neglected.  In
fact, if it hadn't been for the construction of Kern/Mojave in the early
'90's building directly into Kern County, problems would be much worse
today.  The issue has reached such a crescendo in California, that even SoCal
Gas is convening an industry "forum" to discuss intrastate infrastructure
issues on March 8.  Transwestern will be represented there.
As to regulatory bottlenecks, the CPUC launched an investigation a couple of
years ago into the unbundling of the gas industry in California.  In an
unprecedented effort, the majority of stakeholders in the SoCal Gas system;
marketers, producers, pipelines, the CPUC's own Office of Ratepayer
Advocates, and SoCal Gas itself, offered up a comprehensive unbundling
proposal to the CPUC for its consideration and approval.  Unforntunately, the
vested interests of the new owners of former utility generation, used to
having SoCal Gas system resources for balancing/swings [paid for by other
customer classes], put up significant resistance to the comprehensive
settlement proposal.  This generator opposition, along with the well
publicized timing of problems blamed on electric system unbundling, have put
a stake in the heart of the regulatory reform process.
To answer your question about larger expansions, as I said above, I'm not
sure that additional interstate pipe [beyond the current list of expansions
on TW, PG&E and Kern] necessarily has to be put into the ground in order to
meet near term (3-5 year) demand in California.  However, I do believe that
California must take a rational look at its infrastructure needs with an eye
towards relieving significant physical and regulatory bottlenecks in its
intrastate transmission system.
