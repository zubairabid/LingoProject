Harbor Cogen called this on Monday night shift at approximately HE 24 stating
that they would be unable to supply their day ahead schedules due to a crack
in an oil supply line.  Mike at Harbor stated that we should not bid in day
ahead schedules for Wednesday either as it appears to be a problem which may
take some time to fix.  To cover the day ahead schedules we looked for power
to cover it in SP however we could not find even an offer during the night
shift.  I would advise Les and whomever is on the day and night shifts on
Tuesday to keep in touch with Harbor regarding this issue.  Thank you for
your attention to this matter and if you should have any questions please
call me on my cell 702-0463
