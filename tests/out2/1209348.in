Thor,

We are trying to globalise the GTC's so that a customer could transact on a
particular weather product up to 24 hours per day and do so on similar terms
and conditions, even if the product is being passed from one Enron office to
another during the day.

I have learned today that the legal resource we need to work on this will not
be available until the first or second week of January, behind another
weather project which is currently consuming their attention. We are trying
to identify another resource which may be able to help (we need to coordinate
legal response from each of the Enron offices), but so far, no luck.

I had hoped we would be able to resolve this sooner, so that you would not
have your customers accept a new GTC, and then have to accept it again in
short order if we apply changes to the GTC in order to "globalise" it.

If you want to proceed now with the current GTC, we can certainly do that. If
you would prefer to wait for a globalised GTC, we can do that too - it's your
call.

Please advise how you would like to proceed.

Dave
