Per Stacy Aune concerning this issue, her understanding is that a manual
entry will be kicked out unless a cost center is entered for applicable
accounts.  If you have entries to accounts 60000000-79999999 you should
replace the profit center with a cost center for entries with a posting date
on or after 11/1/00.  Most profit centers have one or more related cost
centers assigned to them per the Standard Hierarchy Report but some do not.
If your chosen profit center does not have a related cost center let me
know.

Keep in mind that this is only for accts. 60000000-79999999 and most of those
accounts are not used by our group.  However, we do use some of the accounts
such as 62000000 Interest Income - Third Party, among others.

Cost Centers are only needed for these accounts for entries with a posting
date of 11/1/00 or later.  If you are doing 10/31/00 close entries, do them
the same as you have been.

Since we are in the middle of 10/00 close and this issue does not affect
10/31/00 entries, I will remind everyone in November to review this issue for
their entries.  Let me know if you have any questions.
