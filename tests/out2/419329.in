Enron Canada has a Master Agreement [ECT form, non ISDA] in place with Energy
West Incorporated (which ENA could trade under per the Services Agreement
with ECC covering financial trades only).  Per my conversation a second ago
with Credit, Energy West Incorporated and Energy West Resources are not
showing up in their records as being one and the same corporation.  Sounds to
me you need to call Credit for approval.  If we do not have a master, they
would have to get Credit approval to do a trade w/o a master in place.
