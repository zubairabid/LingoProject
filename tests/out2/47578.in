As some of you may have heard, Jesse Bryson will be heading up our effort on
real-time tagging with the assistance of Cara Semperger.  To better
facilitate our effort on tagging and to improve coordination with
settlements, Jesse will be moving to days beginning January 10th.
As a result of Jesse leaving the rotation, we will have an opening for shift
work in the group.  If you are aware of someone that you feel might be a good
fit in the real-time group, please pass their resume onto Greg Wolfe, Amy
FitzPatrick or myself, and we will take a look at them.

Thank you,

Bill
