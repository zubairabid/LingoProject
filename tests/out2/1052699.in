The ISO (K Robb) circulated the ISO's position on the Def Penalties this
PM. It is attached.
As it stands, what the ISO wants now (or previously wanted) is an issue to
be decided by the BIC. What is now proposed - empowering the ISO to change
the deficiency rates if an adjacent ISO modifies (presumably upward) their
caps - has one large problem: if such an action were taken in the midst of
a Capability Period it would cause all sorts of issues with participant
positions.
Having said that I offer the following:
The FERC staff report strongly indicated that caps would have to exist (if
at all) on a regional basis and at similar levels.
In order to de-list and be free to sell out, a generator must make that
decision for the following month by the 10th of the current month. That is
trading a sure ICAP revenue stream for the increased opportunity to sell
energy at higher prices - even if some disaster befell one of out
neighbors, the amount that can move is limited by the transmission
capability.
What is the likelihood that any of the 3 NE ISOs will be uncapped next
Summer?
The transmission system limits how much energy can flow regardless of price
considerations. NY-NE about 1500Mw and NY-PJM about 2000 Mw (pending return
of the PARs).
BME, if faced with a reserve shortage (or inability to meet load), will
curtail exports to solve that problem.
