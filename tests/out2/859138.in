the Men and Women  who,ve served our Country as we approach Veteran,s Day
this Saturday. If you know a Vet, thank him or  her. I don,t want to force
my  non-football views but for those interested, I,ve included a quick piece
thanking our Veterans at the end of this report. Thanks.

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.

Passing Game  Matchups. Here's how I see the matchups this  week. Please
note, see the  cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week11sheet.htm
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start. Just because
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup. The matchup info  is meant
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between
players.

Note: I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info. The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position  numbers are from
ESPN.com.

Here we go:



Locks: These games heavily favor the Offense

Kansas City  Passing Game vs 49er Defense  Virtually every  skill position
player is a decent start against the 49ers. But understand that last week
QB Elvis  Grbacthrew for more  yards than Randall Cunningham, Akili Smith,
Doug Pederson and Kordell Stewart  combined. San Francisco can,t stop
anyone and I don,t envision them learning how this week. San Francisco
allows more Fantasy Points  to the opposing QB than any other team in the
league. The KC RBs are a mess and  coach Gunther Cunningham says they won,t
throw as much but he says that every  week. WRs Derrick Alexander  and
Sylvester  Morrisare great  plays.  TE  Tony Gonzalezcould be big  too. If
you have a Chief, start him  this week.

Denver Passing  Game vs Raider Defense  For the year, the  Raiders have
been pretty weak against the pass averaging 18.22 Fantasy Points  Allowed to
the opposing QB which ranks them #23. But over the last four weeks, they,ve
been awful, letting opposing offenses rack up an average of 276 passing
yards  per game. That,s the most in the  league. Granted, two of those
games  were against the suddenly pass happy Chiefs but there were also games
against  Seattle and San Diego in that average as well. Elvis Grbac set some
records last week  torching the secondary for 500+ yards and Brian
Grieseshould have  success as well. He continues to  play excellent football
making good decisions. Most importantly, he has a healthy  Terrell  Davisnow
to keep the  defense honest.  WRs Ed McCaffrey  andRod Smith  are must
starts as  both are liable to explode at any time.  The TEs are trickier to
predict as they have three who figure heavily in  the mix.  Dwayne Carswell,
Byron Chamberlain  andDesmond Clark  all rank in the  top 30 TEs over the
last three weeks.  It,s tough to count on any one of them but if you had to
pick one,  Carswell had 4 catches last week.

Jacksonville  Passing Game vs Seahawk Defense It wasn,t supposed to play
out  this way for Seattle but as we enter week 11 of the season, the Seahawks
find  themselves floundering. Not only  are they having trouble scoring
points, their defense is giving up entirely too  many points. CB Shawn
Springs is a  player but the defense has allowed an average of 268 passing
yards per game over the last four  weeks. That ranks them  29th in the
league. They  rank 18th in the league when it comes to Fantasy Points
allowed to the opposing  QB for the year. Jacksonville,s  certainly had its
struggles but this could be a game that  QB Mark  Brunelldoes some damage
with a week to prepare. WR Jimmy  Smithis listed as  probable on the injury
report this week.  Reportedly, he,ll be ready by Sunday but keep an eye on
it. Keenan  McCardellwill be  ready. I keep trying to like rookie  R. Jay
Soward but just can,t do it. He could do something but I don,t have  any
faith yet.  TE  Kyle Bradyis suddenly the  Jacksonville Secret Weapon and he
could play a big part again in the  offense.

New Orleans  Passing Game vs Panther Defense Last year it was St. Louis.
This year the Saints are the once awful  team that,s playing inspired
football.  ThePanther defense has allowed an average of 261 passing yards
per game  over the last four weeks. That  ranks them 28. They've been
slipping as for the year, they rank # 9 in Fantasy Points allowed to the
opposing QB.  Jeff Blakeis coming off a 3  TD, 275 yard game last week and
should continue to roll. WR Joe  Hornis the prime  receiver as he reeled in
167 yards worth of Blake,s passes Sunday. Keith  Pooleon the other side  was
supposed to take up the slack for injured WR Jake Reed but he,s been
disappointing.  WR  Willie Jackson caught 4 passes  Sunday and he could
continue to see action. TE Andrew  Gloverlooked very good  Sunday and he,s a
guy that might come on.

San Francisco  Passing Game vs Chief Defense The Chiefs have no problem
throwing the ball. Unfortunately  for Chief fans, they also have no problem
letting the other team throw the  ball. Kansas City ranks # 27 in  Passing
Yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. They also rank # 20 in
Fantasy Points Allowed by  the opposing QB for the year. All  that spells
another solid day for Jeff  Garcia. Keep a very close eye on  Terrell
Owens,turf toe  though. Reports are that he,ll play  Sunday but this type of
injury can be ugly and hard to recover from so we,ll  watch this one closely
for you.  Jerry Riceis as solid as  ever on the other side. If Owens is
limited, JJ Stokesor  Tai  Streets would see more action. Personally, I
like Streets of those  two. RB Charlie  Garneris always a  threat receiving
the ball and TE Greg  Clarkshowed a hint of  being more involved last week
catching 4 passes. I,m cheering for him but I don,t expect  Garrison
Hearstto be a factor  for the 2000 season.

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Jets Defense Whether you want to lay it  on
the opponents or not, it,s hard to deny the Jets defense has slipped
lately. For the year, they rank #  13 in Fantasy Points allowed to the
opposing QB and over the last four weeks,  they,ve allowed an average of 261
passing yards per game which puts them at #  26. They,ve given up 11 total
TDs  over those four games which is more than you,d expect from them. This
week, they,ll face a Colt team  that,s been challenged by QBPeyton
Manningand coach Jim  Mora to kick up the intensity.  Again last week, the
Colts seemed to be going through the motions for the  first half and then
made a mad dash at the end. Last week, Manning ran out of tricks in the bag
as they were  humiliated by Chicago. He still  finished with 300+ yards but
he could have been even better. I like the way he,s rallying the team  and
once again, he should be looking to WR Marvin  Harrison. After Harrison, it,
s tough to call as  Manning,s spreading the ball around.  WRs EG Green,  and
Jerome Pathon  both saw  action. For some reason,  Terrence Wilkins wasn,t a
factor as he only had a couple of  passes thrown his way and didn,t catch
either of them.  TEs  Marcus Pollard andKen Dilger  were their usual  solid
but tough to predict selves.  And of course RB Edgerrin  Jamesis a solid
receiver. Outside of Harrison and  James, it,s a gamble for who will do well
but any of these guys are probably  worth a start if you,re thin for
receivers.



Prime Matchups:  These games favor the Offense

New York Giants Passing Game vs. Rams  Defense Two very good teams going in
slightly different  directions. The Rams are dealing with adversity losing
their two best  players while the Giants are regaining some of their early
season steam.  Rejuvenated QB Kerry Collins will face a St. Louis defense
that's still yielding lots of passing yards. In fact, they rank # 25 in
passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. They rank # 23 in
Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs for the year. WR Amani  Toomer's
rewarded the owners who hung with him through the rough games  as he's been
on fire lately. Ike Hilliard is a fine # 2  WR as well. RBs Tiki Barber and
Ron Dayne  provide a solid running threat and TE Pete Mitchell  should
contribute more than he has been.


St. Louis Passing Game vs  Giant Defense New York is a good team and it's a
pretty  tough matchup against the Giants. New York ranks # 16 in Fantasy
Points  allowed to opposing QBs this year. And they rank # 4 in passing
yards  allowed over the last four weeks. Plus they'll be getting CB Jason
Sehorn  back this week it appears. QB Trent Green has done an  admirable job
filling in for Kurt Warner. I'm betting he'll continue that  success here.
Isaac Bruce is the # 1 WR,and he'll  bring Az-zahir Hakim and Torry Holt
into the  fold as well. All are viable starters. TE Roland Williams  is a
decent play but he's inconsistent. Throw in the fact they'll  likely be
throwing a lot without Marshall Faulk and I think they'll do  well.

Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Packer Defense  Green Bay may have salvaged their
season with Antonio Freeman's  spectacular catch Monday night but they still
have a pass defense that gives up  too many yards. For the year, they rank #
24 in Fantasy Points allowed to  opposing QBs and over the last four weeks,
they've allowed 242 passing yards per  game which also ranks them # 24.
Shaun King continues to  post nice numbers even if they're not real pretty.
Over his last three  games, he's thrown 7 TDs but has only rolled up 526
yards. Still, that  ranks him # 12 among QBs. He's been diagnosed with
Tonsillitisas of  Thursday after complaining of fatigue.He's expected to
play but  watch it. Of course, his favorite WR is now Keyshawn Johnson  after
Keyshawn's private meeting at King's house a couple of weeks  ago. They're
winning with getting the ball to Johnson so don't look for  that to change.
Jacquez Green is a solid WR and the  better deep threat. TE Dave Moore has
been more active  catching a TD last week.

New York Jets Passing Game vs Colt  Defense Owners of Chicago's Jim Miller
like to think  it was all Miller last week as he ripped through the Colt
secondary.  Truthfully, the Colt's porous pass defense had plenty to do with
it.  Vinny Testeverde should have similar success. The Colts  rank # 18 in
passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. But that  includes
giving up a decent amount of yardage to less than juggernauts Chicago,
Detroit, New England and Seattle. WRs Wayne Chrebet and  rookie sensation
Laveranues Coles should do well.  TE Anthony Becht is finally starting to
fulfill  expectations. He's probable on the injury report with a knee injury
but  should be able to play.


Buffalo Passing Game vs Bear Defense  The Bears have played decent pass
defense of late ranking # 17 in  passing yards allowed over the last four
weeks. Peyton Manning rolled up  302 yards against them last week and there
were several badly dropped  passes. The Bills will reportedly start Doug
Flutie. He's a foot shorter than Manning but brings scrambling  ability the
Bears may have a tough time with. TE Jay Reimersma  is back to the focal
point we all thought he'd be and that should  continue. Eric Moulds is the
prime threat at WR with  Peerless Price and Jeremy McDaniel rounding  out the
WRs. I'd think Reimersma and Moulds will get the bulk of the work  though.



Even Matchups: These games feature no real advantage  either way

Chicago Passing Game vs Bills Defense If I'm  Cade McNown, I'm starting to
get very worried. New QB Jim Miller  looked very good Sunday as he went 24
for 35 with 214 yards, 1 TD and 0  interceptions. That's a great start.
He'll have a tough go of it  this week there could be enough hoopla
surrounding the Buffalo QBs that Chicago  can sneak in. The Bills are ranked
# 19 in passing yards allowed per game  over the last four weeks. Miller's
main target will again be WR  Marcus Robinson. He's big enough to match up
well with  the Bills CBs. After Harrison, it gets hard to predict with Eddie
Kennison and Marty Booker catching plenty of  balls. TE Kassem Sinceno
becomes a little more involved  each week. I keep looking for him to make
that big catch.

Oakland Passing Game vs Denver Defense The  Raider attack is firing on all
cylinders here. Denver ranks # 8 in passing  yards allowed over the last
four weeks. They rank # 15 in Fantasy Points  allowed to opposing QBs for
the year. In their week 3 matchup, QB  Rich Gannon threw 2 TDs but had his
lowest yardage total of the year  (159) and had 2 interceptions. They've
improved since then.  WR Tim Brown is the primary guy of course but both
Andre Rison and James Jett may make  plays. I'm not totally into the Rison
hype as he's not getting tons of  looks. Although he is making the very most
of what he's getting.  TE Ricky Dudley awoke from his slumber with a
vengeance.  He's so frustrating but he's too talented in too good a
situation not to play  unless you have another great TE.

Dallas Passing Game vs Bengal Defense  The Bengals rank # 20 in passing
yards allowed over the last four  weeks. They're # 14 in Fantasy Points
allowed to opposing QBs. What an  injury list the Cowboys have accumulated.
QB Troy Aikman  took the needle again this week with more cortisone shots for
his  back. Is it just me, or is he looking more and more like Nick Nolte in
North Dallas 40 each week? The WRs are hardly recognizable with  James
McNight, Wayne McGarity and Jason Tucker  carrying the load. I'm not real
excited about any of them.  TE Jackie Harris could be the focal point for
the passing  game.

New England Passing Game vs Brown Defense Keep  an eye on this one as much
depends on Drew Bledsoe's right  thumb. He's still listed as questionable
but we'll know more Friday and  Saturday. Assuming he's ok, this is still a
tough matchup. If  Bledsoe sits and John Friesz starts, this probably slides
to a  "downside" matchup. The Browns rank # 5 in Fantasy Points allowed to
opposing QBs. And they rank # 9 in passing yards allowed per game over the
last four weeks. WR Terry Glenn's struggled some of late  but this could be
a game he takes advantage of the Cleveland secondary.  Troy Brown is seeing
some passes as well. The Patriots  haven't thrown to the TE since Ben Coates
left town.

Minnesota Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense  Suddenly, the Vikings and
Daunte Culpepper are  human. Coach Denny Green says Culpepper's been limited
by a sore tailbone  and knee that's hindering his mobility. This week they,
face an Arizona  defense that ranks # 13 in passing yards allowed per game
over the last four  weeks. They also face new coach Dave McGinnis, a guy
with a reputation for  designing defenses to confuse young QBs. They rank #
10 for the year in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing QBs. Some of that is
no doubt a reflection on  their weak rushing defense but the cause really
isn't important. Culpepper  will be throwing to the usual culprits of Randy
Moss and  Cris Carter. Aeneas Williams is fine corner but he can't  cover
everyone. Both Moss and Carter are must starts, as is Culpepper.  They've
had to find a consistent TE.

Detroit Passing Game vs Falcon Defense Lots of  uncertainties as Batch
returns from a concussion in the wake of coach Bobby Ross  quitting. Won't
get on a soapbox but between Barry Sanders bailing out on  his team on the
eve of training camp and Bobby Ross throwing in the towel on a  team with a
winning record in November, I can't remember seeing two quitters on  display
quite so prominently in a while. I'm sure there are behind the  scenes
situations involved but his resignation seemed awfully odd. Must be
something in that Detroit water... The Falcons rank # 14 in passing yards
allowed per game over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank # 25 in
Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs. Charlie Batch  will be throwing to
WRs Johnnie Morton and  Herman Moore who have both been disappointing
lately.  TE David Sloan needs to pick up his game and he could be the  key
to allowing Batch to get into a rhythm.

Green Bay Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense  Both teams seem to have found
their way recently and want to keep the  momentum rolling. The Bucs rank #
15 in passing yards allowed per game  over the last four weeks. They rank #
11 in Fantasy Points allowed to  opposing QBs for the year. QB Brett Favre
is a wily vet  and he'll be pulling out all the stops. Monday's game was
encouraging not  just for the win but because Favre seemed to be comfortable
feeding WR  Antonio Freeman the ball more often. That's great news for both
players. Bill Schroeder is a factor too but Freeman is  clearly the most
talented WR.  Bubba Franks and Tyrone  Davis still share enough time at TE to
limit the other from being a  major factor.

Carolina Passing Game vs Saints Defense The  turnaround of the Saints is
one of the best stories of the season.  Certainly, their tough defense
deserves much credit. Against the pass, New  Orleans ranks just # 16 in
passing yards allowed over the last four games.  They're much tougher
against the rush. For the year, they rank # 6 in  Fantasy Points allowed to
opposing QBs. Steve Beuerlein  is certainly not the 1999 version we saw but
he's still a pretty good  QB. Donald Hayes and Muhsin Muhammad will continue
to  make plays. They have a decided height advantage over New Orleans CBs
Fred  Weary and Kevin Mathis. In the absence of TE Wesley Walls, Casey
Crawford will  likely get the start if Kris Mangum can't go.


Downside Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Arizona Passing Game vs  Viking Defense If you're in contention in week 11
with  Plummer as your QB, congratulations, you're one heck of a manager. I'm
no  Jake Plummer fan but if you're going to play him, this could be  the
week. Minnesota is improving on defense, but they're still susceptible  to
the big plays. They rank # 23 in passing yards allowed per game over  the
last four weeks David Boston is injured with a bad  hamstring and missed
practice Wednesday. Frank Sanders is  in a huge slump, even by his standards
which is saying something.  Martay Jenkins may be the best WR on the team
right now.  Enough said.

Miami Passing Game vs Charger  Defense Quietly, the Dolphins and Jay
Fiedler  are winning football games. Fiedler probably isn't winning them
for your fantasy team though. He faces the Chargers this week who are back
to playing a little bit more like the Chargers of old. San Diego ranks #  26
in Fantasy Points allowed by opposing QBs for the year but they rank # 11 in
passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. Fiedler will be
throwing to Oronde Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd.  Tony Martin is expected to
see action as well. Fiedler may  continue to play well but the Chargers are
improving on defense.

San Diego Passing Game vs Dolphin  Defense Charger coach Mike Riley has
announced  Moses Moreno will get the start at QB. At least with  Harbaugh
you had an experienced QB behind center. The Dolphins rank # 22  in passing
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. But for the  year, they
rank # 8 in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs. I think  they'll be
closer to their year long numbers this week. Moreno will throw  to TE
Freddie Jones primarily and  even with the matchup, he's  too good to
sit.Although it remains to be seen if Moreno will lock onto  Jones like
Harbaugh did. In theKC game where Moreno played  extensively,Joneswas the
target 7 times which is less than his  normal.  WRs Curtis Conway and Jeff
Graham are  up and down players and probably not starters in most leagues.

Seattle Passing Game vs Jaguar  Defense With Brock Huard's set back this
week in his  recovery from a concussion, it looks like Jon Kitna gets
another start. The Huard situation is very worrisome to me. He's  awfully
young to be having this type of problem. Usually, it seems like  it's the
old guys like Aikman and Chandler that have trouble shaking the  cobwebs. I
don't like it. Jacksonville ranks # 22 in Fantasy Points  allowed to
opposing QBs this year. Over the last four weeks, they rank #  21 in passing
yards allowed per game. Kitna will spread the ball between  Derrick Mayes and
Darrell Jackson likely as  Sean Dawkins is battling a deep quad bruise.
Dawkins  might be a factor but he looks to be limited right now. TE
Christian Fauria caught just 1 pass last week but it was for a TD so  you
have to consider him again.



Defensive Slam  Dunks: These games heavily favor  the Defense

Tennessee Titan Passing Game vs. Raven  Defense QB Steve McNair has
trouble  throwing the ball with a healthy bunch of WRs. He doesn't have
anything  close to a healthy bunch of WRs. Kevin Dyson is  gone. Yancey
Thigpen is gone without technically  leaving. Carl Pickens is hobbled and #1
WR  Derrick Mason is less than 100%. Looks like more receptions for  TE
Frank Wycheck. Imagine that. The Ravens are  suddenly inspired with their
offense finally breaking the scoreless TD-less  streak and they could be hard
to handle.

Philadelphia Passing Game vs Steeler  Defense In case you haven't noticed,
the Steelers are an  excellent football team. They'd be hard to handle if
only they had a QB.  They're defense is all we're concerned about here and
it's pretty darn  good. They rank # 2 in passing yards allowed over the last
four  weeks. They also rank # 2 in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs.
This doesn't bode well for QB Donovan McNabb. He'll  attempt to throw to
Torrance Small and Charles  Johnson. Small is actually starting to get more
looks but it  probably won't matter. TE Chad Lewis hasn't been nearly  as
effective as he was early and I don't look for him to rebound in this  game.

Atlanta Passing Game vs Lion  Defense This one could get ugly as Chris
Chandler  looks to miss the game as he recovers from a concussion suffered
last  Sunday. Danny Kanell gets the start. He'll  facea Lion defense
that's pretty solid and ranked # 7 in passing yards  allowed over the last
four weeks. Kanell with throw to WRs Terance  Mathis and Tim Dwight. Mathis
has played very  well of late but could struggle against a Lion Defense that
will be looking to  exhibit some of that post coach firing enthusiasm. TE
Reggie Kelly  shows nice flashes here and there but needs to be  consistent.

Baltimore Passing Game vs Titan  Defense The Ravens exploded last week in
the TD department  ending their much publicized drought. That "explosion"
came against the  Bengals who'd have a tough time stopping the University of
Maryland, much less  Baltimore. I'm guessing the Ravens find the going just
a tad bit rougher  against a solid Tennessee defense. The Titans rank # 5 in
passing yards  allowed over the last four weeks and # 7 in Fantasy Points
allowed by opposing  QBs for the year. QB Trent Dilfer gets the start
again.  Qadry Ismail and Patrick Jeffers are the WRs  with Travis Taylor now
on injured reserve. But TE  Shannon Sharpe is the primary threat, especially
in the Red zone.  He's probably the only Raven I'd feel good about starting.

Cleveland Passing Game vs Patriot  Defense The Browns are tough to watch.
QB  Doug Pederson, bless his heart, seems to try awfully hard but it takes  a
lot more than trying to succeed at this level. Against a crafty  defensive
guy like Bill Belichick who's great at confusing the QB, it might be  ugly.
One good thing about Pederson is that he does seem to rely on WR  Kevin
Johnson almost exclusively. He's not a bad play if you need  a WR just
because you know he'll see the ball.Although you haveto  wonder how he'll
fare againstPatriot CB Ty Law.  Rookie WR Dennis  Northcutt has talent but
like the Bengal's Peter Warrick, is stuck in a  bad situation. TE Aaron Shea
isn't a factor.

Pittsburgh Passing Game vs Eagle  Defense The Eagle / Steeler game looks to
be a slugfest as  both defenses should manhandle the offenses. Philadelphia
ranks # 6 in passing  yards allowed per game over the last four weeks.
Against QB  Kordell Stewart, that number ought to look even better next
week.  The Eagles rank # 3 in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs for the
year.  Stewart will try to throw the ball to WRs Plaxico Burress, Troy
Edwards  and Hines Ward but I wouldn't hold my breath.  TE Mark Bruener did
score last week but I wouldn't expect that  too often.

Cincinnati Passing Game vs Dallas  Defense Let's put it this way. WR
Peter  Warrick may be the best QB on this team. The Bengals face a  Dallas
team that's got it's back against the wall with a near comical series of
injuries. The Bengals may be just what the Cowboys need for taking out  some
frustration. QB Akili Smith will face a defense  that's ranked # 10 in
passing yards allowed per game over the past four  weeks. Smith will throw
the ball to WRs Peter Warrick and  Craig Yeast. This team just doesn't have
any veterans to  show these guys who to act. Warrick's a great talent and
probably worth a  start as you never know what he'll do but it's a tough
situation for him.  TE Tony McGee is tough to depend on.



Rushing Game Matchups  Here's how I see  the matchups this week. Please
note, see the cheatsheet online for exactly where I rank  players and to
determine who to start.  Just because one matchup may be more favorable than
another, that doesn't  necessarily mean I'd start the player with the best
matchup. The matchup info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box
when it comes to deciding between players.



Locks: These games heavily favor the  Offense

Oakland's Tyrone Wheatleyand  Napoleon Kaufman vs Bronco Defense IfI
learned one  thing last week, it's to notto listen to Jon Gruden concerning
Tyrone  Wheatley.Remember last week all he talked about was how limited
Wheatleywould be and that Kaufman would carry the load. We know how  that
went. This week will be even worse with Monday night. I'll get  you every
bit of info that I hear but I can already see it's going to be tough  call
with his ankles. Making it worse is the fact Denver has given up tons  of
rushing yards. They rank # 31 in rushing yards allowed over  thelast four
weeks but of course the Corey Dillon romp skews that a  bit. For the year,
they rank # 21 in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing  RBs.

Minnesota's Robert Smith vs  Cardinal Defense New coach Dave McGinnis may
have given the  team a boost but he was the defensive coordinator for one of
the worst rush  defenses in the league before he moved to the head post.
Arizona ranks #  30 in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks. With
Daunte  Culpepper still learning the game and likely to face some confusing
schemes from  McGinnis, look for Smith to be relied upon.

New England's J.R. Redmond and  Kevin Faulk vs Brown Defense J.R. Redmond
has been a nice  surprise after a slow start. He's shown nice power and
quickness.  Kevin Faulk has seemingly settled into the 3rd down role which I
think suits him  better. Cleveland hasn't stopped anyone on the ground as
they rank # 26  for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing RBs. They
rank # 29 in  rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks. I never feel
completely  comfortable predicting what Bill Belichick will do but I'd guess
Redmond will  see the bulk of the work here.

Jacksonville's Fred Taylor vs  Seahawk Defense Seattle ranks # 24 in
Fantasy Points  allowed to opposing RBs for the year. It's even worse lately
where they  rank # 28 in rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks. I
look for  Fred Taylor to have a nice game as the Jaguars try to salvage
their  season. They're on the brink of missing the playoffs and I'd expect
coach  Tom Coughlin to focus on what he loves best, the run.

Cincinnati's Corey Dillon vs  Cowboy Defense The Baltimore game last week
showed Dillon  isn't Superman but this is a great matchup for him. Dallas
hasn't stopped  anyone on the ground ranking # 27 in rushing yards allowed
over the last four  weeks. They rank # 29 in Fantasy Points allowed to
opposing RBs. I  worry about the Bengal passing game (or lack of it) but
Dillon still should be  able to run.

San Francisco's Charlie Garner vs  Chief Defense The Chiefs rank # 27 in
Fantasy Points  allowed to opposing RBs this season. They're # 26 in rushing
yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks. That has to have Charlie
Garner owners  licking their chops. He's cooled a bit from his red hot start
but this  could be the game he gets back on pace.



Prime Matchups:  These games favor the Offense

Detroit's James Stewart vs Falcon Defense  Atlanta comes into week 11
ranked # 30 in Fantasy Points allowed to  opposing RBs. They rank # 25 in
rushing yards allowed over the last four  weeks. This could be the
confidence boost the Lions need after the Bobby  Ross resignation. Atlanta's
struggling and with Chris Chandler likely out,  the Lions have a chance to
dominate this game.

Atlanta's Jamal Anderson vs Lion Defense  This could be a running game
"shootout". The Lions aren't much  better than the Falcons defending the
rush ranking # 24 in rushing yards allowed  over the last four weeks. Jamal
Anderson has been fairly quiet this  season. With QB Chris Chandler likely
out, they'll need him to carry the  offensive load.

New Orleans' Ricky Williams vs Panther  Defense Carolina ranks # 16 in
rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and that number will
likely be worse once Ricky  Williams is through with them. He's running with
the power and aggression  everyone hoped for last season. I think the
difference is not only his  health, but a solid passing offense to take some
heat off him.

Cleveland's Travis Prentice vs Patriot  Defense New England only ranks # 23
in rushing yards  allowed per game over the last four weeks. For the season,
they rank # 26  in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing RBs. Prentice and the
Cleveland  offense have struggled but this could be a decent matchup if
you've been  thinking about playing him.


Dallas' Emmitt Smith vs Bengal  Defense Cincinnati ranks # 20 in Fantasy
Points allowed to  opposing RBs. They rank # 12 in rushing yards allowed
over the last four  weeks. With their QB and WRs decimated by injuries, it
looks like it'll be  Emmitt almost by default. I'd look for Dallas to ask
him to carry the load  this week.


Even Matchups: These games feature no real advantage  either way

Pittsburgh's Jerome Bettis vs  Eagle Defense The Eagles rank # 22 in
rushing yards allowed  over the last four weeks. For the season, they're a
little better than  that ranking # 16 in Fantasy Points allowed to RBs.
Bettis has been a nice  surprise this season but it looks like he'll be
without starting center  Dermontti Dawson and that's a blow.

Seattle's Ricky Watters and  Shaun Alexander vs Jaguar Defense Over the
last four weeks,  Jacksonville ranks # 21 in rushing yards allowed per game.
For the season,  they rank # 17 in Fantasy Points allowed to opposing RBs.
That's not very  Jaguar - like and you know they're dying to get it turned
around. The big  worry for Watters owners is that coach Mike Holmgren starts
looking to next year  and gives Alexander more time. Be careful there.

Tampa Bay's Warrick Dunn and  Mike Alstott vs Packer Defense Green Bay
checks in with the  # 20 defense for rushing yards allowed per game over the
past four weeks.  For the year, they're # 11 in Fantasy Points allowed to
opposing RBs. It's  tough to predict how coach Tony Dungy will use his RBs.
Dunn has been  carrying the ball more than usual lately but you'd think Tampa
would like to get  into more of a grind it out mode with Alstott. Although
the big guy has to  prove he can hold onto the ball.

New York Jet's Curtis Martin vs  Colts Defense Defenses have keyed on
stopping Martin lately  while they take their chances with QB Testeverde.
It's been pretty  effective as Martin's not made much noise. I'm not sure
the Colts can  contain him though. They rank # 19 in rushing yards allowed
over the last  four weeks. With Martin and Edgerrin James on the field,
it'll be a  matchup of two great RBs.

Buffalo's Sammy Morris and  Shawn Bryson vs Bear Defense Chicago ranks # 18
in rushing  yards allowed over the past four weeks. With QB Doug Flutie
under center,  I'd look for continued running from Morris and Bryson. Both
seem to put up  similar Fantasy numbers. If I had to pick one, I'd probably
go with  Morris.

Indianapolis' Edgerrin James vs  Jets DefenseTheColts are looking to
rebound  from a sub par performance last week. I'd think you'll see better
execution and more of a reliance on James instead of Manning having toplay
catch-up. The Jets rank # 15 inrushing yards allowed over the last  four
weeks. James is a must start with his potential in all facets of the  game.

Arizona's Michael Pittman /  Thomas Jones vs Viking DefenseKeep an eye on
Pittman  as he seems to have a habit of finding some sort of injury to limit
him.  The Viking defense isjust averageas they rank # 13 in rushing yards
allowed over the last four weeks. Newcoach Dave McGinnis reportedly  wants
toget the ball into Pittman's hands more. Although Jones is  the guy
they've paid the big money to so you have to wonder how long he'll  sit.

Miami's Lamar Smith vs Charger  Defense For the season, San Diego ranks #
13 in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing RBs. They've been tougher lately
but I like the  way Lamar Smith is running with confidence. I'd start him
without  hesitation this week.



Downside  Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Green Bay's Ahman Green vs Buccaneer Defense With  Dorsey Levens out, the
Pack turns to Green. He seems to be anxious and  ready to contribute. Tampa
ranks # 11 in rushing yards allowed over the  last four weeks so it'll be a
tough matchup. For the year, Tampa ranks #  10 in Fantasy Points allowed to
opposing RBs. He's got skills though and  could do well.

Baltimore's Jamal Lewis vs Titans Defense  Tennessee comes into week 11
ranked # 10 in rushing yards allowed over  the last four weeks. For the
year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points allowed  to opposing RBs. That's
solid. They're quick and athletic and should  be a good match for the
physical Lewis. I'd expect less than his normal  production from him.

Kansas City RBs vs 49er Defense San Francisco has  been fairly soft against
the run ranking # 17 in rushing yards allowed the past  four weeks. For the
year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy Points allowed by  opposing RBs. But I've
lost all faith in Gunther Cunningham and his  running game. They've gone
from everyone getting the ball to nobody  getting the ball while Elvis Grbac
throws all day. I like Kimble Anders  but I'd avoid all KC RBs if you can.

San Diego's Jermaine Fazande vs Miami Defense  Fazande seems to be the RB
of the week for San Diego as he ran for 74  yards on 22 carries last week.
That's a lot for a Charger RB. The  Dolphins are tough against the run
though ranking # 9 over the last four weeks  in rushing yards allowed per
game. Even without LB Zach Thomas, it'll be a  tough matchup.

Denver's Terrell Davis vs Raider Defense  Make sure to understand: Terrell
Davis is a sure starter, this is just  a tough matchup for him. Over the
last four weeks, Oakland ranks # 2 in  rushing yards allowed per game. I
expect Davis to do well, he's just got  his work cut out for him.

New York Giant's Tiki Barber and Ron Dayne vs Rams  Defense The Rams have
been tougher against the run lately  where they rank # 6 in rushing yards
allowed over the last four weeks.  Their offense continues to force people
to pass the ball. The Giant RBs  have been very effective though so you
can't count them out. Coach Fassell  seems more willing to use Ron Dayne in
different situations than he did early  on. And Barber is a great threat
catching the ball.



Defensive Slam Dunks: These games heavily favor the  Defense

St. Louis' Justin Watson vs  Giants Defense The Giants rank # 1 in both
Fantasy Points  allowed for the year to opposing RBs and in rushing yards
allowed over the past  four weeks. In other words, they're tough, and
they've been tough.  Justin Watson will have had more time to prepare for
his start this week but I  don't think this is an Olandis Gary for Terrell
Davis type situation where the #  2 guy steps in easily and performs almost
as well as the # 1 guy. Marshall  Faulk does too much in that offense.
He'll also be spelled likely by Trung  Canidate but I'll believe it when I
see that candybone on the field.  Robert Holcombe could see some time at RB
too.

Chicago's James Allen / Curtis  Enis vs Bills Defense The Bills play tough
rush defense  ranking # 3 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed
per game.  They rank # 5 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed by opposing
RBs. This  will be a tough matchup for any Bear that carries the ball.

Carolina's Tshimanga  Biakabutuka vs Saints Defense New Orleans ranks # 4
over  the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game. They're
shutting  folks down and I don't think the Carolina running game is strong
enough to buck  that trend this week.

Tennessee's Eddie George vs  Raven Defense  Eddie George is a must start
assuming he's healthy  this week. I just don't like the matchup against a
very tough Raven  Defense that's ranked # 7 in rushing yards allowed over the
last 4 weeks.  He'll grind out some yards but it'll be tough.

Philadelphia's Darnell Autry vs  Steeler Defense Autry may have had success
last week but  this week he hits a roadblock in the Steeler defense.
Pittsburgh ranks # 2  for the year in Fantasy Points allowed for opposing
RBs. I don't that will  change after this game.





WHAT IS A  VET

Some veterans bear visible signs of their  service: a missing limb, a jagged
scar, a certain look in the eye. Others may carry the evidence inside  them:
a pin holding a bone together, a piece of shrapnel in the leg - or perhaps
another sort of inner steel: the soul,s ally forged in the refinery of
adversity. Except in parades,  however, the men and women who have kept
America safe wear no badge or  emblem. You can,t tell a vet just  by looking.

What is a vet?

He is the cop on the beat who spent six months  in Saudi Arabia sweating two
gallons a day making sure the armored personnel  carriers didn,t run out of
fuel.

He is the barroom loudmouth, dumber than five  wooden planks, whose overgrown
frat-boy behavior is outweighed a hundred times  in the cosmic scales by four
hours of exquisite bravery near the 38th  parallel.

She or he*is the nurse who fought against  futility and went to sleep sobbing
every night for two solid years in Da  Nang.

He is the POW who went away one person and  came back another*or didn,t come
back AT ALL.

He is the Quantico drill instructor who has  never seen combat*but has saved
countless lives by turning slouchy, no-account  rednecks and gang members
into Marines, and teaching them to watch each other,s  backs.

He is the parade*riding Legionnaire who pins  on his ribbons and medals with
a prosthetic hand.

He is the career quartermaster who watches the  ribbons and medals pass him
by.

He is the three anonymous heroes in The Tomb  Of The Unknowns, whose presence
at the Arlington National Cemetery must forever  preserve the memory of all
the anonymous heroes whose valor dies unrecognized  with them on the
battlefield or in the ocean,s sunless deep.

He is the old guy bagging groceries at the  supermarket*palsied now and
aggravatingly slow*who helped liberate a Nazi death  camp and who wishes all
day long that his wife were still alive to hold him when  the nightmares come.

He is an ordinary and yet an extraordinary  human being*a person who offered
some of his life,s most vital years in the  service of his country, and who
sacrificed his ambitions so others would not  have to sacrifice theirs.

He is a soldier and a savior and a sword  against the darkness, and he is
nothing more than the finest, greatest testimony  on behalf of the finest,
greatest nation ever known.

So remember, each time you see someone who has  served our country, just lean
over and say Thank You. That,s all most people need, and in most  cases it
will mean more than any medals they could have been awarded or were  awarded.

Two little words that mean a lot, &THANK  YOU.8

Remember November 11th is Veterans  Day!

&It is the soldier, not the reporter, who has  given us freedom of the
press. It  is the soldier, not the poet, who has given us freedom of
speech. It is the soldier, not the campus  organizer, who has given us the
freedom to demonstrate. It is the soldier, who salutes the flag,  who serves
beneath the flag, and whose coffin is draped by the flag, who allows  the
protester to burn the flag.8
