Beyond The Numbers

Monday,s action resembles the good old days

Monday morning futures indicated for a very sharp opening. Markets
gapped open higher and traded lower due to the continued uncertainty
in the political front. However, shortly after dipping into the negative
territory, buyers stepped up to drive the markets higher again. Strength
in technology stocks helped Nasdaq outpace the blue-chip index.
Nasdaq finished the session higher by 97 points to close above the
3000 mark. Blue-chip index for its part finished the session higher by
only 12 points, thanks only to the strength in Intel and Microsoft. Monday,
as tech stocks picked up momentum old economy stocks went out of
favor. It is worth noting that we saw the same pattern of trading many
months ago when Nasdaq was in favor.

Federal Reserve,s actions will take time to produce results

Monday,s &Market Analysis8 explained why a change in interest rates
by the FED may take many quarters to produce any meaningful effects.
This was clearly evident when the Federal Reserve raised rates 6 times
beginning last June 1999 to slowdown the economy. As our readers
may realize the effects of all those rate hikes were not evident up until
recently. Which implies that buying stocks in anticipation of a rate hike
may not translate into a sustainable long-term rally.

Plenty of problems ahead

Monday more companies pre-announced negative earnings for their
upcoming quarters. We like to remind our readers there are still many
weeks left for pre-announcements. We at Realtimetraders.com expect
this quarter,s pre-announcements to exceed last quarter's. We also
believe the earnings picture for US companies to be mixed with a
negative bias for the next few quarters.



Sector Analysis

Momentum is starting to build in technology stocks

Despite the problems in the economy, the oversold technology stocks
are setting the stage for a Santa Claus rally. In Monday`s market
analysis we wrote of several reasons why we expect the markets to
see an upside move in the next few weeks. Given Monday,s upside
move in tech stocks and the fact the tech index (Nasdaq) managed to
close above the initial resistance level of 3000 is yet another reason
that leads us to believe the markets may be setting the stage for a
rally in the next few weeks.

Semiconductor and biotech Indices are heading higher again

Some of our readers may recall that semiconductor and biotech were
the 2 strongest sectors that powered the Nasdaq index to record levels
in early 2000. Monday,s best performing sectors were the 2 former
high-fliers. Given the momentum that is building in these sectors, it is
a good idea to watch these 2 sectors and the Nasdaq as a whole in
the next few weeks.



Economic Reports & Bond Markets

Bond markets remain quiet

As the equity markets have been rallying in the past few sessions,
bonds have been trading in a range. Monday long bond finished the
session lower by 2 ticks at 103.08. There are no major economic
reports due out on Tuesday.
