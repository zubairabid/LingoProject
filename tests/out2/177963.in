ENERGY ALERT FROM THE SILICON VALLEY MANUFACTURING GROUP

At 11:46 this morning the California ISO announced a Stage 3 alert, and
immediately ordered rotating outages throughout the state.  At a minimum,
consumers in blocks 9H through 10B are projected be effected by rotating
blackouts.  The outages will last until at least 2:00 p.m. today, while the
Stage 3 alert will be in effect until midnight tonight.

In an ongoing effort to ensure the integrity and reliability of our local
electricity grid, the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group is urging member
companies to immediately voluntarily reduce their use of electricity to
avoid the imminent threat of rolling blackouts.

Below, the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group is providing energy
conservation action items, which can be used immediately to help avoid a
more serious energy shortfall. Please incorporate these tips into your daily
routine while in the office and at home.

Following are some suggestions by PG&E to reduce electric demand today, and
through this time of short supply.

Turn off lights when they are not needed. Turn off lights in unoccupied
rooms.
Send documents via email instead of fax.
Turn off PCs, monitors, printers, and copiers when not in use or not
needed. If you can, simply turn off the power strip after shutting down your
computer and peripherals. If you cannot turn off the whole computer, turn
off the monitor and the printer.
Avoid using major appliances this afternoon and early evening, if
possible. If you must, do only full loads when using your dishwasher and
clothes washer. Use the cold water setting whenever possible, and select the
air-dry setting, rather than heat-dry setting on your dishwasher, if you
can.
Unplug energy leaking electronic equipment. Many new electronic devices
(TVs, VCRs, computer peripherals, etc.) use electricity even when turned
off. If possible, unplug electronic devices with block-shaped transformers
on the plug when not in use.
Turn off lights in unoccupied rooms. Turn off unnecessary and decorative
lighting around your home and office.
Cook in your toaster oven, microwave or broiler oven. They use half the
energy of a regular oven.
Install motion detectors to control lighting in frequently unoccupied
areas such as storage rooms, copy rooms and rest rooms.
Retrofit incandescent bulbs with energy efficient fluorescents.  Seventy
percent of what comes off the 100-watt bulb is heat, not light.
