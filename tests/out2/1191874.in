Dear Justin,
Have spoken with Dave Minns just now and I think he is going to spk with you.
I don't think I have been clear enough and I am sorry.  We here at Enron
Japan have no particular desire (or resources at the moment) to send out EOL
related correspondence from here.  If, however, EOL decides it is better for
EOL related correspondence with Japanese counterparties to go from Enron
Japan Corp. (as the legal entity responsible for the content of a letter)
rather than any other Enron entity, then we will have to review and sign the
correspondence (since it will create legal obligations for us) or have
someone else sign pursuant to a limited power of attorney.
If you want the letters to go from Enron Japan Corp. and for the EOL logo to
be on the paper then we would also need to consider whether we (EJ) needed to
register the logo as a business / trade name here.  I am not sure whether
this has been done.  (Also note that at the moment although the Japanese
version of the letterhead refers to "Enron Japan Corp.", the English
translation says "EnronOnLine".  In any case these should be consistent I
would think.
On the other hand, if the correspondence can go from EOL LLC, or another
Enron legal entity then we do not need to be involved and I think this would
be our preference.
I know that the Enron Metals people here are trying to convert their
customers over to EOL.  The EJ traders are also trying to sell EOL in the
market.  The time therefore may come when we prefer to "personalize" our EOL
dealings by having them sent from EJ or Enron Metals out of Tokyo but I don't
think that time has quite come yet.
As a separate issue, if EOL wants to use the Enron Japan address in Tokyo on
its letters to Japanese counterparties, it may have to register a branch and
this may have unexpected tax implications for EOL LLC. This would need to
considered by Susan Musch.
Pls let me know what you decide to do and again I am sorry about the
confusion.
