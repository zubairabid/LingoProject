The online bond trading sites we are evaluating have stated that they and
their clearing broker are our nominal counterparties.  However, I was
informed yesterday by Weiss, Peck & Greer that our exposure on affirmed
trades is to our prime broker.  (Our prime broker has exposure to the site's
clearing firm.)  We confirmed this with our prime broker and with Sheila
Glover.
Thus, statements that 1) transactions will be cleared through our prime
broker and 2) the site is responsible for the accuracy of terms of offers and
executed trades (as Buy Side Direct added) may sufficiently address the issue
of our exposure.
Please let me know if you would like to discuss.
Thanks.
