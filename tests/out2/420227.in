Re: Navajo Tribal Utility Authority:  Per Leslie, not a FERC approved
counterparty.  This cpy can have read-only access for US power products.
Leslie spoke to Dinanna Dechilly at the authority and they are not interested
in trading power at this time, but will let her know when they are.  She will
have to follow up with them re: their FERC approved status at that time.
