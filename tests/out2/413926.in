Below is my listing of the remaining projects.

1.  Finish painting sunroom.
2.  Paint bedroom furniture.
3.  Replace two front door thresholds.
4.  Put mailbox in Nancy & Peter's front door.  They have the hardware.
5.  Sheetrock over their livingroom bookcase at Nancy & Peter's.
6.  Paint outdoor pipes same color as house.
7.  I spoke to Bob Goss, they took the light fixture cover out of my back
stairwell (it's in the ceiling) and lost it.  Bob asked if you could replace
it for him and send him the bill.
8.  Additional plumbing (1) airconditioning pipe, and (2) washing machine
hoses in back of garage, and cover open drain near door to garage bathroom
plumbing.

That should do it!
