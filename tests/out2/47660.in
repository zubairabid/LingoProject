We would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone who took the time to
respond to the Pulse survey conducted in October.  Your feedback is very much
appreciated.
The survey helps identify inhibitors that keep you from accomplishing your
job, while helping us assess the company,s progress toward removing barriers
that keep employees from achieving their personal best.
Out of the 2,299 ENA/EGM/EIM employees invited to participate in the survey,
1,478, or 64% responded.  Enron uses an outside firm, Watson Wyatt, to
tabulate data and report results.  A synopsis of what we heard from you has
been added to our intranet site.  The site address is

we intend to continue in this vein.
