Hey Kate! I received a BPA trade that Mike/Greg did and under Special
Provisions on their confirmation it reads:
This is a remarket of Kaiser Aluminum & Chemical Company power. KAC's
point-to-point transmission agreement will be utilized. KAC's scheduling
agent may request changes to the delivery point(s) under alternate point of
delivery capabilities associated with KAC's transmission agreement. BPA shall
accommodate the scheduling of such changes.
Is this language o.k. ?
