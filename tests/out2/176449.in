To Help Provide Power During Energy Crisis
AQMD EXTENDS OPERATIONS LIMIT ON EMERGENCY GENERATORS
In an effort to give essential public services greater ability to respond to
power emergencies, the region's air quality agency issued an executive order
today extending the amount of time that such agencies can run emergency
generators.
"Gov. Davis declared a state of emergency last week due to the state's power
crisis," said Barry Wallerstein, AQMD,s executive officer. "In response, AQMD
has increased the amount of time that emergency generators at hospitals,
police stations, fire houses and other essential public services can operate."
Under AQMD's executive order, essential public service providers can operate
emergency generators up to 500 hours in a calendar year, which more than
doubles AQMD's Rule 1110.2 operation limit of 200 hours per year. AQMD rules
normally limit emergency generators to 200 hours per year because they are
typically diesel-powered, have no pollution controls and emit 300 times more
smog-forming pollution per unit of energy than a new power plant.
Today's order allows essential public service providers to operate up to 500
hours per year during an imminent or actual power blackout in the provider's
area. It also promotes the use of low-sulfur diesel fuel, defined as
containing 15 parts per million or less of sulfur, if reasonably available.
The provisions of the order are consistent with U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency guidance on this issue.
The order expires on Feb. 3, 2001, but can be renewed in 10-day increments.
It applies to the following public services:





Police and fire fighting facilities;

Hospitals and other health care facilities;

Kindergarten through high schools;

Drinking water agencies;

Public transit agencies;

Prisons;

911 emergency dispatch operations;

Publicly owned sewage treatment plants;

Landfill gas operations; and

Critical military operations.

Under AQMD's Rule 118, the agency's executive officer can suspend AQMD rules
for public health and safety services for 10 days at a time in response to a
state of emergency declared by the state or federal government.
AQMD has set up a hotline, (909) 396-2660, to assist operators of backup
generators at non-essential public services to voluntarily apply for a
variance with AQMD's independent Hearing Board.
AQMD also will approve applications submitted by any emergency generator
operator that is not an essential public service to revise their permit to
allow up to 200 hours of operation.
"The governor has determined that the power crisis poses an extreme peril to
public safety," Wallerstein said. "We are doing our part to ensure that
public health and safety agencies can keep operating during periods of
potential blackouts."
AQMD is the air pollution control agency for Orange County and the urban
portions of Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties.
