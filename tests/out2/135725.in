Candy:

I have been having trouble with my email, but it's back on line. Have  you
gotten my phone messages regarding the meeting with Murray Fogler? It  went
well, and he hasagreed that if we can't find an easy solution to the
issues, he will support me in court on the motion to transfer the case to
Houston. At my suggestion, he will also ask Duke about the possibility
oftheir participation in a quick mediation or binding arbitration, and  will
make contact (he says he has had none up to now) with counsel for Chisos to
take their temperature on these and all other issues.

In the meantime, he will (at his own prompting) consider the last paragraph
of my original letter as our settlement offer and come back with an
"official"  response. I will let you know as soon asI hear something.
