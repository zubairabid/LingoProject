case summaries


Administrative Law



Back to Quicklinks

This summary also appears under Constitutional Law

Issues: Whether the Attorney General's dual representation as the party
appellant and as counsel for appellee-PSC constituted an impermissible
conflict of interest; Mootness; Standing; Conflict wall; Michigan Rules of
Professional Conduct
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Published)
Case Name: Attorney Gen. v. PSC
e-Journal Number: 8713
Judge(s): Griffin and Talbot; Dissent - Meter

A conflict of interest arises when the Attorney General intervenes as a party
in opposition to a state agency that she represents as counsel. Therefore in
this case, the Attorney General's dual role as both the party appellant and
as counsel for appellee-PSC constituted an impermissible conflict of
interest, and the Attorney General was not exempt from the conflict of
interest rules by virtue of her statutory powers. The court acknowledged the
unique status of the Attorney General as a constitutional officer of the
state and her concomitant statutory authority to represent the state as its
chief legal counsel, although the Attorney General is not immune from the
rules of professional conduct. In this case, the court directed the Attorney
General to file either a stipulation for substitution of counsel for the PSC
or a consent of the client for continuation of counsel after consultation
regarding the conflict of interest within 21 days to remedy the conflict or
the appeal would be dismissed.

Contracts



Back to Quicklinks

This summary also appears under Real Property

Issues: Breach of contract; Option to purchase real property conditioned upon
acquisition of governmental approval and permits for development; Whether
purchasers could unilaterally waive conditions in option agreement;
Applicability of Brotman v. Roelofs
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: Vidican v. Wright
e-Journal Number: 8667
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Zahra, Hood, and McDonald

Plaintiffs could not unilaterally waive the conditions in the parties'
contract granting plaintiffs an option to purchase a subdivision from
defendants, because the conditions requiring receipt of all necessary
governmental approvals and permits for development inured to the benefit of
all parties. This case was distinguishable from Brotman v. Roelofs because
here, defendants could only receive payment if plaintiffs were successful in
disposing of the individual subdivision lots, and the governmental permits
were a necessary precondition to the sale of any lots in the eventual
subdivision and therefore, any payment to defendants. Where, as here, all
parties benefited from the conditions and there was a continuing relationship
after transfer, Brotman was inapplicable. Summary disposition for defendants
was affirmed because under the clear and unambiguous conditions of the
parties' contract, failure to satisfy the conditions caused the option to
expire. Affirmed.

Family Law



Back to Quicklinks

Issues: Termination of parental rights
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: In re Shirley
e-Journal Number: 8672
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Cavanagh, Talbot, and Meter

The family court properly terminated respondent-mother's parental rights and
its findings on the statutory factors were not clearly erroneous. The family
court found that respondent failed to show sufficient consistency with her
children, she had made insufficient progress with her problems, the children
had serious problems that needed to be addressed, and respondent often missed
or was late for visitations with the children. The family court also found
that because respondent showed little intention of complying with the agency
agreement, termination of respondent's rights was not contrary to the
children's best interest. Affirmed.

Insurance



Back to Quicklinks

Issues: Uninsured motorist coverage; Whether plaintiff's claim for uninsured
motorist benefits was barred by the "other owned vehicle" exclusion in the
policy; Whether the term "motor vehicle" in the "other owned vehicle"
exclusion in the policy included motorcycles
Court: Michigan Supreme Court
Case Name: Wert v. Citizens Ins. Co. of Am.
e-Journal Number: 8708
Judge(s): Weaver, Taylor, Corrigan, Young, Jr., and Markman; Voting to grant
leave to appeal - Cavanagh and Kelly

In lieu of granting leave to appeal, the court reversed the judgment of the
Court of Appeals in this case (see e-Journal # 7193, in the 5/31/00 edition
and the July 2000 Michigan Bar Journal Green Sheets edition) for the reasons
stated by the dissenting judge, and remanded the case to the circuit court
for further proceedings.

Litigation



Back to Quicklinks

Issues: Attorney misconduct; Offer of judgment sanctions; "Interest of
justice" exception; "Unusual circumstances"; Admission of expert testimony;
Qualifications of expert; Whether expert's method had gained general
acceptance; Harmless error; Admission of testimony that defendant's staff was
unaware of any previous falls in defendant's parking lot; Cumulative error
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Published)
Case Name: Stitt v. Holland Abundant Life Fellowship
e-Journal Number: 8712
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Hoekstra, Griffin, and Bandstra

Defense counsel's repeated attempts to introduce evidence relating to the
illumination of plaintiffs' counsel's parking lot, despite the trial court's
having ruled the evidence inadmissible, did not warrant reversal of the trial
court judgment of no cause of action. Although plaintiffs objected to each of
the instances complained of on appeal, all but one of those objections was
sustained and no further relief was requested. The court could not conclude
that questions of counsel which were not answered constituted misconduct
requiring reversal when plaintiffs neither requested that the jury be
instructed that questions of counsel were not evidence, nor requested a
mistrial. However, the award of offer of judgment sanctions against
plaintiffs was reversed under the "interest of justice" exception. "Unusual
circumstances" existed in this case, (1) because of the unsettled nature of
the law, which was changed or clarified during the course of appeals in this
case and (2) the gamesmanship that occurred by the offer of judgment
defendant made after the mediation evaluation. Defendant rejected a $160,000
mediation evaluation, then made an offer of judgment of $25,000. Affirmed in
part and reversed in part.

Full Text Opinion




Malpractice



Back to Quicklinks

Issues: Medical malpractice; Whether the trial court erred in refusing to
default the defendant or prevent him from presenting a defense based on the
failure to follow the requirement of o 2912e that a defendant shall file an
affidavit of meritorious defense; Whether the defendant's failure to file an
affidavit of meritorious defense deprived the trial court of subject matter
jurisdiction
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Published)
Case Name: Wilhelm v. Mustafa
e-Journal Number: 8711
Judge(s): Collins, Jansen, and Zahra

Defendant's failure to timely file an affidavit of meritorious defense did
not deprive the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction and the trial
court did not abuse its discretion by denying plaintiff's motion seeking to
sanction the defendant by entering a default or by precluding the defendant
from presenting a defense. Although the requirement that a defendant file an
affidavit of meritorious defense is mandatory, the statute does not indicate
that default is the mandatory, or even appropriate, remedy where a defendant
fails to file the affidavit. Plaintiff did not raise the issue of the
defendant's failure to file the affidavit until the first day of trial. The
trial court could have sanctioned both parties--defendant for not filing the
affidavit of meritorious defense in a timely manner, and plaintiff for not
including her procedural defense in the final pretrial order. A court's
subject matter jurisdiction is determined only by reference to the
allegations in the complaint. It was apparent from the allegations in
plaintiff's complaint that the negligence alleged was within the class of
cases with regard to which a circuit court is empowered to act. The trial
court had jurisdiction, and the defendant's failure to timely file his
affidavit did not affect the trial court's power to hear the case. The jury's
verdict of no cause of action was affirmed.

Negligence & Intentional Tort



Back to Quicklinks

Issues: Premises liability; Slip and fall on an oily substance in a parking
lot; Failure to present evidence from which it may be inferred that defendant
or defendant's employees either created or knew of the oily substance in its
parking lot; McCune v. Meijer
Court: Michigan Court of Appeals (Unpublished)
Case Name: Leske v. Warren Dental Assocs., P.C.
e-Journal Number: 8668
Judge(s): Per Curiam - Zahra, Hood, and McDonald

Summary disposition in favor of defendant-property owner was proper in this
premises liability case, because the evidence indicated that the oil spot
plaintiff slipped and fell on was of the nature of a condition commonly found
in ordinary parking lots. Opting to allow it to naturally absorb into the
asphalt was not an unreasonable response. Defendant did not, by unreasonable
action or inaction, create a dangerous condition in the parking lot. To
withstand defendant's motion for summary disposition, plaintiff had to
establish that defendant had notice of the condition, but plaintiff presented
no direct evidence indicating how or when the oil was spilled onto the
parking lot. The only evidence plaintiff offered to show that defendant knew
or should have known of the oil spot was her testimony that the oil was black
and had spread to a diameter of two and a half feet. This was not sufficient
evidence from which one could infer that defendant had notice of the oil
spill. Affirmed.

Employment Discrimination/Harassment Investigations



PROPER HANDLING of employee discrimination and harassment claims requires
outside counsel. Selecting an attorney
experienced in employment litigation and the EEO investigative process
ensures the integrity (i.e., fairness and objectivity) of the
internal investigation. It also avoids in-house conflict of interest
problems. An independent investigative summary gives
management a credible basis for evaluating an employee's claims, taking any
necessary workplace corrective action, and
minimizing liability exposure. Attorney Lori K. Shemka, who is also an
EEO-certified investigator, is presently accepting new
employment investigation assignments. (248) 568-6494 or shemka@concentric.net
