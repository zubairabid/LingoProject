Demand Side,s Promise

The coldest days of the year are when wholesale electricity prices are  among
their highest, and when the risks of blackouts are greatest, least  welcome,
and even dangerous. On these days, frequently around the holidays, our
electric system and wallets are stressed to the limit. As energy demand
surges,  prices in the wholesale electric market skyrocket, with price caps
serving as  the only limits to the pricing power of wholesale suppliers. And
as more  electricity is generated, old fossil fuel power plants emit more and
more  pollution into our environment.

At the other extreme, the hottest days of the year present the same
scenario, often with the added designation of being the smoggiest days.
Sometimes the smog * caused in part by the sun heating up pollutants emitted
from power plants * is so bad that people are advised to stay indoors, and
thousands with respiratory illness crowd emergency rooms across the nation.

Yet, we could all breathe easier, save money, and worry less about our  power
going out, if many more consumers were given the opportunity to change  their
electric usage in response to escalating prices, and to profit from doing
so. In electric restructuring vocabulary, &demand-side response8 is
typically  used to describe these consumer actions to reduce or shift their
electric usage  in response to changes in prices.

For years, encouraging demand reduction or energy efficiency has been the
holy grail for the environmental community, because many of our country,s
most  pressing environmental and public health problems cannot be solved if
the nation  simply guzzles ever more dirty power. But these days, the case
for fostering  demand-side response has never been stronger, and there is an
emerging consensus  that goes well beyond the environmental community about
the importance of  increasing demand-side response.

More and more experts now agree that empowering consumers to modify their
electricity usage in response to price will powerfully address the triple
threat  of pollution, high electric bills, and rolling blackouts, all of
which are now  plaguing California. Indeed, electric restructuring in
California or any other  state will not be complete until consumers are able
to modify their usage in  response to real-time prices.

But while greater demand-side response would deliver numerous benefits to
consumers, the economy, system reliability, and the environment, most
electric  markets presently provide far too few opportunities * even within
Pennsylvania  and PJM, where retail and wholesale electricity competition
have been the most  successful.

Therefore, as the next crucial stage in its electricity restructuring,
Pennsylvania and PJM must now lead the way in creating policies and market
mechanisms to increase opportunities for demand-side response.
Encouragingly,  both the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (PUC), where
Commissioner  Fitzpatrick sponsored a November 21st conference on the
subject, and PJM,s  management understand the stakes.

Demand-Side Benefits
A legitimate demand-side market  would serve as a check on high prices in the
hourly and forward PJM energy  markets. PJM,s Market Monitoring Unit
calculates that a 1 percent reduction in  demand during peak periods (about
500 mW) can reduce market prices by about 10  percent. Empowering customers
to participate in the demand-side market limits  wholesale and retail prices,
impacting the forward market and making the retail  market more competitive.

In addition, a demand-side response reduction of 5,000 mW would enable PJM
to once again retain its one-day-in-ten reliability standard, an historic
reliability benchmark which has been put at risk due to the off-system sales
of  generators this past summer.

The Technology
Three types of technologies are required  to achieve 5,000 mW of reliable
demand-side participation. Each is readily  available and, more importantly,
pays for itself. Yet not enough of these  technologies are being installed in
homes and businesses to safeguard the public  interest.

Remote appliance controls. These controls enable a consumer to  voluntarily
curtail his/her electric usage during peak periods in exchange for  an
economic benefit. For example, in its &On Call8 program, FPL installs an
energy management device in consumers, homes, connecting it to one or more
qualifying appliances. Through this program, FPL pays consumers up to $161
per  year in credits on their electric bills. More than 600,000 FPL customers
are  currently participating.

Here in PJM, BGE pays residential consumers $10 per summer month for
installing an &Energy Saver Switch8 on their central air conditioners.
During  periods of high demand for electricity, BGE sends a radio signal
which activates  the switch, cycling the compressor in 15-minute increments.
More than 225,000  BGE residential customers currently use the Energy Saver
Switch and help BGE  manage summer peak load. Consumers who choose to
similarly cycle their electric  water heater receive an additional $5 credit
per summer month.

Also in PJM, PEPCO,s 200 mW-sized &kilo-watchers plus8 program offers
participants about $100/year for the right to remotely cycle 100 hours of
residential air conditioning. In another example, The Allegheny Electric
Cooperative in Pennsylvania remotely switches air conditioners and water
heaters  from a central location in downtown Harrisburg.

For most consumers in these programs, it,s money in the bank without
noticeable impact. These programs demonstrate that many small consumers want
the  opportunity to voluntary save money in return for agreeing to brief
interruptions of selected appliances, and that it,s fairly simple to provide
the  technology and operate the program.

The Pennsylvania PUC and other state Commissions should encourage and, if
necessary, direct jurisdictional EDCs to offer remote appliance devices to
consumers. It,s not difficult to imagine that, if remote appliance devices
were  implemented throughout PJM, 3,000 mW of small commercial and
residential  remotely cycled load could be bid in a demand-side market.

Metering Set-Top Devices or Advanced Metering. Advanced metering or  metering
set-top devices register load decrements, enabling consumers and/or  their
suppliers to sell firm power into the peak market, instead of using it.  For
example, a supplier (either the local utility or a competitive supplier)
could offer a lower price to a large consumer willing to reduce usage during
peak load, enabling the supplier to sell a relatively small amount of
electricity to those requiring firm service during the peak load. The
consumer  need not agree to limit usage except upon specific approval.
Already Duquesne  and soon PECO Energy will have deployed advanced metering
system-wide,  demonstrating that it can be economic even without the benefits
of demand-side  response.

There are also various devices or meter add-ons that modify existing meters
and allow recording of load decrements (see, for example,
www.stonewatersoftware.com). These  devices or meter add-ons appear to pay
for themselves when the energy is sold  during periods when prices are above
the price the consumer is paying the EDC.

The need to ensure reliability in PJM, combined with the current
availability of technology to enable demand-side participation by all
consumers,  dictate that by 2004, all Pennsylvania customers should be
equipped with a  metering or appliance control device.

Internet-based Energy Management Platforms. Computer software is  necessary
to maximize the effectiveness of advanced metering. Programs have  already
been developed and used by major international corporations which enable
them to make precise decisions on when to sell power back into the market,
decrease usage, and use on-site generation. BGE, for one, recently announced
deployment of the Omni-Link platform
(www.powerwebtechnologies.com/news/111200.htm).

Demand-Side Barriers
There are no inherent obstacles to  obtaining the benefits of demand-side
responses, but there are several important  commitments necessary to make the
promise of demand-side market participation a  reality.

PJM and other ISOs, as well as utilities and suppliers, must all be able to
offer demand-side platforms without discrimination. In addition, PJM and
other  ISOs have the direct responsibility to manage system reliability and
the  wholesale energy market. Demand-side responses directly impact
reliability and  wholesale market prices, including undesirable market power
during peak load.  There can be no doubt that ISOs have an inherent role,
indeed an inherent  responsibility, to maximize the effective deployment of
demand-side market  responses, especially to offer a platform for LSEs to
sell load decrements  created in response to price signals. PJM is on board,
but consumers who want to  sell directly into the PJM demand-side market face
opposition from some  EDCs.

To unlock the potential of demand-side markets, the Pennsylvania PUC, other
state commissions and the FERC must support the role of PJM and other ISOs
in  creating such a market. PJM must be permitted and encouraged to offer a
demand-side platform. Finally, EDCs must be required to fully deploy
advanced  metering and remote appliance control programs.

These small but important public policies will help to protect the
reliability of our electricity system, our wallets, and our environment.
