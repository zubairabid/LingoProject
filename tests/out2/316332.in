Joel,
Mary Lynn Ruffner has been involved, but to my knowledge has not reviewed the
documents.  Matt Gockerman handles most of the tax stuff for enovate.
As for the structure, the commercial focus is on keeping things as simple as
possible.
If Sarah doesn't have a copy of the LLC agreement, I can get you one.
Lou Stoler was involved in the formation of enovate, although I coordinate
most of their legal issues now.
I've seem a preliminary DASH, but I don't know where it sits now.
Hope this helps.
