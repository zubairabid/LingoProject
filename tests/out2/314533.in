Hi guys,
Here are some quick thoughts:
2.10  Suggest we delete "specific" from second line.
3.3  (i)To protect cash flow neutral status we need to get the money a couple
of business days before date due.
6.2  We need to discuss changes which could materially impact the value of
the agreement to MEH, not just the risks/responsibilities.
I'd bracket the concept of what the Admin Service Fee is supposed to cover.
Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing
docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?  I think we probably need to
limit our role to "short of litigation" type stuff.   Maybe "reasonable
efforts, short of litigation", something like that?
That's all for the first quick read.
