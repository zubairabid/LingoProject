This testimony was provided by PG&E in response to TURN's motion to roll TRA
balances into the TCBA.  While useful for internal purposes, the testimony
was struck from the proceeding.  PG&E has said they will be filing a
subsequent application to the Commission on their rate stabilization plan
within the next week.  I would expect to see this, or similar information, in
that filing.
