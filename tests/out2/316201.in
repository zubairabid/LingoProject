SU was fun, but there was  a little incident with a streaker (more like a
stroller on stage).  Otherwise, it was great.  Paige did really well, and she
was front and center for most of their act.

I don't know what we are going to do about Thanksgiving.  Neil and I are
negotiating. I neglected to discuss it with Paige this weekend, of course.
It is hard to believe it is only a few weeks away.

Michael and I are both better, although he didn't get better until Friday
night.

Hi to all!

Love,

Kay
