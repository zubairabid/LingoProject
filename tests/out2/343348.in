Mark -
thanks for the response.
I agree with you that identifying all of the Regulatory Risks associated with
either a specific asset (e.g., Sutton Bridge) or a trading book (e.g., UK
gas) is impossible.  We could have 50 people spending 100% of their time
sitting around dreaming up 'what-ifs' and still not see everything.  On the
other hand, as your team does now, once we have been able to identify
reasonable risks, it is more than appropriate to attempt to impute /
calculate the potential loss and assign people to mitigate these risks.
On the flip side of the risk coin, the process of identifying Regulatory Risk
should also allow Govt Affairs, working with our business colleagues,  to
identify rule changes / policy changes that could positively impact our
bottom line.  For instance, we could push through regulatory action for a
retail rate decrease providing EES with more commodity margin.
I don't disagree that these risks which I am trying to track are business
risks.  But they are fundamentally the result of changes in regulatory policy
(taxes, export/import, rates, etc.).  Because Enron is actively participating
in many regulated or semi-regulated environments, regulatory risks are
business risks.
Finally, it is my understanding that Govt Affairs needs to be involved in
assisting our business people in managing these risks.  To this end, the
Regulatory Risk Working Group has identified the following set of
responsibilities for Govt Affairs:
_ To identify Regulatory Risks within current assets.
_ To analyze pending transactions for Regulatory Risks.
_ To recommend alternative commercial arrangements to reduce Regulatory Risk.
_ To assess and compute &value at risk8 for each Regulatory Risk.
_ To develop transfer mechanisms for Regulatory Risk (e.g., insurance).
_ To propose and/or plan mitigation devices for Regulatory Risks.
_ To assign EGA and/or commercial responsibility and resources for mitigation
efforts.
_ To review mitigation efforts against existing plans.
_ To advocate regulatory frameworks which reduce Regulatory Risk (e.g., BIT).
_ To prevent catastrophic Regulatory Risk events (> $25 MM).
_ To report to Enron management global Regulatory Risk position.
_ To coordinate knowledge with other risk groups within Enron.
I look forward to seeing you when you are in Houston and discussing this
further.  Like you, I don't want to create some process that provides little
to no value.
