Could one of you please call Amy Baird to talk to resolve Items #3 and #4 in
her memo.  They have agreed to our changes on #1&#2.  Mike Cesario at Ormet
told me to drop #5.  They did agree to limit total consequential damages to
$1,000,000 for the contract.  They would like for the language in 8.3 to
limit their damages to actual replacement costs (transport, hedges,
re-marketing the gas)  since we can't really incur consequential damages.
