Wayne - to remind, there are two operational issues that had been on the
agenda that keep
getting deferred : the Singapore license entity and a regulatory issue in
Korea.   The deferral of
the Singapore one defers our license application and our timeline for
Singapore.  I
told the commercial team  we hoped to deal with it in this week's call, but
that even then
the license would slip to January, with Singapore processing time.   So we
need to try
to decide the entity this week or next, either in this call, or by e-mail, or
in a separate
call - - whatever is the most efficient way.   Otherwise with the holidays we
may lose
an additional month.   What is the best mechanism to decide this?
In Singapore, if we can see our way clear to go with the already established
entity, of course
that would be simpler, but I defer to the group's judgment.
For the Korea question, perhaps all we need to do is agree to ask Kim and
Chang
to look at it (including mine and Jan Haizman's and Jae-Moo Lee's thoughts)
and
give us their advice.  If legal authorizes that I can get some material worked
up to send.
I will be on the Thursday call from the beginning unless I am in the air in
which case
I will join around 60-90 minutes into the call.
Thanks.
