Responsibility  for daily operations of building support services in the
Enron Building, Houston leased offices, and Two Pacific Place (Omaha) will be
transitioning from Corporate to Enron Energy Services (EES) by year-end.  The
areas affected include facility operations and maintenance of mechanical,
electrical, and air-conditioning systems; mail delivery;  housekeeping;
food, copier, and records services.
This transition of services, as presently managed by Enron Property and
Services Corp. (EPSC), is designed to optimize value to Enron,s Business
Units by leveraging facility management businesses now offered by EES to
their commercial customers.  EPSC staff having administrative responsibility
for these services will report to Enron Facility Services, a subsidiary of

in its development role, remains a part of Enron Corporate Administration
Services (ECAS) along with Corporate Security and the Aviation Department,
