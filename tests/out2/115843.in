Dave:
1. Are you referring to the paragraph where I have a blank?  If so, this is
part of Leslie Hansen's issue which she and Mark have discussed and I wasn't
sure when I drafted this who our counterparty would be.
2. With respect to Paragraph 4, all we are doing is saying that their
indemnity to us does not  cover losses that we incur as a result of our own
acts.  This is a crave out that we have given in the past to those that I
have requested it and it seems to us a fair compromise given the one-sided
nature of the indemnity language.
