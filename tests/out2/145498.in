Over the next several months Enron will be phasing in a new expense-reporting
product, Concur Technologies, Expense Management System (XMS).  You will be
able to prepare your expense report, send it for approval, and transmit it
for payment using the Intranet.  It will be far more user-friendly than the
Excel-based form currently in use and will provide a truly paperless
process.  In addition, the system efficiently integrates with the SAP
accounting system.

On October 16, employees who used a prior version of the product upgraded to
the most current release.  On October 30, it will be available to Enron Corp
employees, Company 0011.  The rollout to other groups will continue through
January 2001.  Rollout announcements will be made to each business unit.

In Houston, IT Central will provide four training sessions per week. To
enroll in a class go to itcentral.enron.com and click on
Services>Training>Schedules. Those in outlying locations and those who prefer
on-line training can use LEAP by signing on to sap.enron.com and clicking on
Training, then LEAP.  Use xms (lower case) as the User ID and Password.

We are excited about this new system and hope you will find it useful.  If
you have questions regarding its use contact IT Central at (713) 345-4727 or
