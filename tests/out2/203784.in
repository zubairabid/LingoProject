Interactive Open Season - Two packages of transportation capacity were posted
on Friday 7/21 for auction.  Strong markets out west indicate we should
expect at or near max rates for the 3-month space and above average bids for
the 12-month space.  We expect 6-12 bidders to actively participate.  A
significant amount of time was spent by all team members working with IT
personnel modifying the existing computer system to enable the auction to
take place.  Thanks to all who made this come together.

Duke - We sold to Duke a firm transport agreement that will bring 20,000
MMBtu/d of incremental supply to TW's east end at the Crawford receipt
point.  The contract is a 2 year FT agreement beginning 8/1/00 for 20,000
MMBtu/d from Crawford to Oasis (EOT - EOT) at $0.02 for year 1 and $0.0250
for year two.

NGPL Winkler I/C - This interconnect was activated on Monday and began
flowing gas its first week of operation.  We received a nomination of 40,000
MMBtu to supply western gas demand.

Southwest Gas - We received the shipper executed agreement in our office this
week!

August Gas Sale - 10,000 MMBtu/d was sold for the month of August at
$4.10/MMBtu.

SoCal - Visited their office to discuss among several things the issue of the
Needles Window.  SoCal's fluctuation of this set point has hampered TW's
throughput for several months now.  They agreed to give Transwestern a chance
to meet the 750,000 MMBtu/day.  The window has been 750,000 MMBtu/day and
above since our visit and TW,s deliverability has not been a problem.
Additionally, PG&E has raised their window to 300,000 MMBtu/d.  These two
events combined allowed TW to deliver near-record throughput to California
this week.  Thanks to everyone, including all Ops Team Members for helping
make this happen.

PG&E - Met with Market Center personnel to discuss storage opportunities for
both TW & PG&E.  They were interested in the idea of using TW,s Park'N Ride
Service when their storage was allocated (a role reversal from when we
initiated this program last year).  The Market Center and TW will continue to
talk daily to pursue any storage opportunities that arise.

El Paso Merchant Services was provided a 10-year proposal for transportation
in TW's East of Thoreau Area for a potential power plant load off of the
PG&E-Intrastate line beginning November 2001.  Initial expected load
requirements of 10-15,000 MMBtu/d may increase to 75,000/d during the term of
the agreement.  This would be incremental supply into TW's east end.

Unbound Technology - Met with Unbound representatives again this week.  This
wireless message provider gave us a draft proposal outlining potential
services TW could use in an effort to be more proactive with customers
regarding noms, confirmations, cut notices, and auction information.  We will
review the draft internally and follow up with them next week with additional
questions.

Cross-Functional Team Meeting - Attended the Operational Team meeting in
Albuquerque this week.  We gave a short presentation on the status of various
capital projects, proposed transport services, and overall market conditions
that are impacting the pipeline.

Aquila - Gained $35,000 in the realignment of points on an existing Aquila
contract.
