The Friday Burrito

" To succeed in politics, it is often necessary to rise above your
principles"

This is the last Burrito for the Year 2000. I, like you, need some time off,
although I doubt that will happen. Just take a quick look at the events of
the last three weeks. Can you believe what we have been through? From FERC
Orders, to emergency filings, to on-again, suspended, and then on-again rate
stabilization filings, data subpoenas, credit crunch, and don't forget some
wickedly high price spikes.

I have been unhappy with the public image our industry portrays. I feel
there needs to be a stronger, more effective group public relations media
blitz that has yet to materialize. I asked one journalist with whom I have
had several interviews, "When you write a column, who is your audience?" She
said she writes as if she was explaining the matter to her mother. It's an
old journalist's trick.

Amazed at the answer, I decided to call my mother, and ask her what she
thought about the whole electric situation. After all, she qualifies as a
typical fixed-income California resident living in a retirement community in
Laguna Hills. "Mom," I asked, "what do you make of the whole situation?"
"Oh, I am disgusted," she chirped, "with that Supreme Court ruling. That's
no democracy." "No, not that situation, Mom," I said to calm her down, "but
the electricity restructuring thing." "Well," she sighed, "everyone is
worried about their electric bills. How much are they going up? And, why
haven't you called me more often? I could have died, and my children would
be the last to know?" Every tag line has a message.

So there it is. If you want a simple view that people understand, then there
it is. People are worried about their electric bill. The reasons for the
increase are of less concern, than how much their bills may go up. All the
blather about forward contracts, alleged gouging, Stage 3 emergencies,
governance, jurisdiction, and FERC Orders is not on the minds of ordinary
California citizens. They want to know how much more they are going to have
to pay. And they are worried.

Focus, then, on how we, as an industry, will help. We want to hold down
consumer electric bills in three different ways: by adding new generation, by
giving people more choice as to their energy provider, and by assuring there
is always a provider of last resort to keep the lights on. From these three
simple principles, all else flows. Give me some feedback, and let's see if
we can simply the message even more. Less is more.

This week's holiday grab bag should be big enough to feed any appetite.
