Hi, guys.  The House Commerce Committee currently has five Republican
vacancies with two likely to go to Californians.  Last week, Leadership
determined that Freshman Members are ineligible for this assignment.
Obviously it is important that these new California Members be supportive of
Enron on electricity restructuring.  Currently, Congresswoman Mary Bono and
Congressman George Radanovich have expressed their interest in securing
appointment to this Committee.  We can certainly work with these Members, but
are there other non-Freshman, California Republican Members who would be
better?  Many Members are unaware of how few Members are seeking these
vacancies so a little education on our part could sway their interest.
Please advise.   Many thanks.  Cynthia
