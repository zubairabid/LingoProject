Thanks for your list.  I have talked with Brent and of the three names that
you have listed, he wants to include only Cindy Horn.
I have thought more about Heidi Mason and Jan-Erland and think that they
should be included.  While they do roll into Europe and also have a tie to
accounting, they are the individuals in Sydney and Toyko that we are
depending on to stress and enforce controls.  Heidi particularly does have
active responsibility for risk, confirmations and settlements on a day-to-day
basis.  And in addtion to their role reporting in to Europe, we are looking
to them to oversee controls for other non-EEL traded commodities in their
locations - weather, coal, etc.
I will include Fernley on the invitation list, as I had mentioned the meeting
to him when I saw him in San Antonio.  He can certainly respectfully
decline!
