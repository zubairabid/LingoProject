Hi Mum!  No, tickets were hard to come by.  Tried to get some they released a
couple of weeks ago, but didn't realize everyone would send their secretaries
and interns downstairs to hold places in line!  I'm sure the VPs will get
tired of going to the games, and start giving tickets away.

Tonight is the big CAM gala.  Bill was in trial all week and had no time to
go shopping, or even to get measured for an ordinary tux rental, so he
borrowed one from Andre (who owns 4).  Andre is a couple of inches shorter
than Bill.  Depending on the overall look, I may or may not acknowledge that
Bill is my date.  My 60's dress I got at Wear It Again Sam looks fabulous.
It is a sleeveless gown with an empire waist; the top is maroon velvet and
the rest is very heavy pink satin.  Since it wraps in the back I was able to
move the hooks over to get it to fit.  Dress was $38 but it cost $35 to get
it hemmed!  Ann and I were considering asking Mema to do our hair, but I'm
really going to be pressed for time this afternoon.  Too bad the party is not
on a Saturday.

Our plans for the rest of this weekend are still up in the air.  What are you
doing the weekend of the 16th?  Bill has signed up for the MS150 again that
weekend.  If you are free that weekend why don't I plan to come either Fri.
or Sat. a.m.  Let me know.

Our law conference begins Thurs. a.m. in San Antonio.  Dot (Staci's boss) is
having a party at her house on Lake McQueeney on Wednesday, so I'm driving
Frazier and Tony in the Dentmobile that morning.  We really do have a fun
group; it should be a good time.  If K&J want company I'll drive over to see
them on Thurs. night instead of going to the awards dinner, which was a big
drag last year.  I'll call them this weekend and see what Jim's travel plans
are.

Today we'll find out about settlement in the California proceeding...this
will decide whether I will be tied up in hearings for most of May.  Keep your
fingers crossed!

Love,
Sooz
