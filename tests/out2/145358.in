users.  You can access the system from the Enron Home Page by typing in the
address field http://xms.enron.com.

The new system features coding validation at the line item level and supports
inter-company transactions . The foreign currency activity window is now more
user-friendly.

LOGON ID:
Each night HR information is loaded automatically into XMS.  However, that
process is not yet finalized.  An incomplete load can result in some people
having their old ID (first initial and last name in lower case) and some
having their eHRonline ID (begins with the letter &P8).  If your old logon
does not work, try your &P8 logon.
