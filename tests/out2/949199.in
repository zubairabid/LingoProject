Hi Donna!!

Please sign the Enron Team up for Feb. 20th.

Thanks!!! ...and thanks for all your help last week!  Everyone at Enron is
enthusiastic about the Project, and the Students have been very gracious in
their "thank you" notes.

We're looking forward to the video conference Thursday.  My assistant,
melinda McCarty, will contact you to make sure we're "reciprocally" in sinc
for the broadcast.

Thanks!

--Christie.
