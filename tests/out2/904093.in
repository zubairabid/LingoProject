Internet Tip of the Day
Monday November 27, 2000

For More Information ...

For years now, public TV and other education-oriented broadcasters, like the
History Channel and Discovery Channel, have given their viewers Web addresses
where they can go to get more information on the program's topic. This is a
great idea, and not just because it'll help you get your homework done. If
you're inclined to watch "educational" TV in the first place, you probably
need no coaching to pursue topics you find interesting. These sites are great
places to start. They often list links and other resources. They're also
great for the morning after, when you're discussing what you watched last
night with your friends and co-workers. If you can't remember a certain
thing, or if anything is in dispute, a quick click or two will take care of
things. After all, the Internet is the ultimate argument-solver.

Today's Science & Technology News:

E.T. May Be Here
Scientists thought we'd have to go to Mars or further to find
extraterrestrial life, but the answer may be in our own backyard,
cosmologically speaking -- microbes found in the upper atmosphere may be from
outer space. If so, it could bolster the "panspermia" idea that life camme to
Earth from space, possibly via comet. In other news, seeds buried by a
botanist 121 years ago have sprouted. The climate treaty talks appear doomed.
Also -- lost colony, nanocopters, pack-hunting dinosaurs, nuclear explosions
in space, and rule-breaking buckyballs! Click  here to read more!
