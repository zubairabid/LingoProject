Mark,

Can you please start putting together documentation for the following?

- Pipeline Capacity Trading ETA (to appear on the new capacity trading
website)
- Pipeline Capacity Trading Service Contract (entered into on paper with
piplelines wishing to post their capacity on EnronOnline

I imagine the ETA will be modeled pretty closely on the existing ETA.

For the Service Contract, I assume we will be covering things like:

- Nature of the Service (what we will do and what they will do)
- They will
-Post products on EnronOnline
- Take responsibility for their prices
- Be bound by any transactions which result, subject to their Tariff
schedules.
- Pay for any hardware needed at their end and/or any 3rd party connection
costs (e.g. internet service providers)
- We will
- Provide the software
- Host and maintain the database
- Facilitate access to the application
- Administer User ID's
- Provide support for Product creation
- Representation, warranties and limitations of our liability for the service
- Confidentiality

I assume we may need to sit down and discuss in more detail. I will forward
the latest copy of our functional spec.  Please call and let me know what I
can do to help in putting the above together.

Thanks,

Dave
