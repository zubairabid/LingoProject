that is the saddest response i have heard.  teachers should be continually
tested.  i had some idiot teachers that should have been fired b/c of their
incompetence.  you shouldn't be scared to be tested if you are good at your
job and half way competent.  democrats are so lazy.  how could you vote
democrat?  al gore makes me sick.  enough of my ranting and raving.  what are
you doing this weekend?  i am tired today b/c i went out last night.  this is
a good scene.  probably not as good as miami but there is a lot going on now
and our downtown is booming.    name some small towns that are cool to live
in near south florida.  i heard naples is great.  i need to live on the
ocean.
