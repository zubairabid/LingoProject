Tana,

Attached is an excel file which shows all ECC transactions done with Fletcher
Challenge Industries Limited since October 10, 2000.



I am also faxing back the list of deals which were sent to us by Chamberlain,
Hrdlicka with a couple of comments noted thereon with regards to one
transaction (Basis 5 according to their list).

As well, as I mentioned on the phone, all of our transactions are with
Fletcher Challenge Industries Limited and not Fletcher Challenge Limited as
noted in the letter from Chamberlain, Hrdlicka.

If you require anything else, please let me know.

Dianne
