Frank Vickers and I met with Jack Davis, Pres. of APS about 2 years ago on
their restructuring proposal, and while I don't think there is any love lost
there, he was gracious.  But, we can probably start a little lower down on
the totem pole.  We have just engaged two attorneys who represent APS to help
us with SW, and they can probably give us the right names to call, and can
maybe call ahead to help set things up.
