To Members of the RTO West Provisions and Requirements Content Group:
Hello!
Attached is an e-mail regarding California's New Facility
Interconnection Policy.  My thanks to Barney for sending this to my
attention!
Regarding the March 21st meeting -- I appreciate all of your responses
regarding the rescheduling request.  While some of you were amenable (in
fact it worked better for many of you), it was not doable for a
significant number of members, in particular some who had already made
their travel plans.  As such, we'll go ahead with the meeting as
original scheduled on the 21st.  My apologies to those of you who will
not be able to attend.
