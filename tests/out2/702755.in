Kim:

As we discussed, you will be sending in the response to the SDG&E RFP due on
Thursday morning at 6:00 am.  You can send the prices at the end of the day
Tuesday as I have conditioned the offer as "subject to change for any reason
by EPMI."   In our response, send  via e-mail, 2 documents.  These are
attached.  Shari Stack prepared the red lined version of the EEI  contract.
We tried to get SDG&E to discuss these proposed changes with us, but they
have not called us back.  Tracy put the credit terms together some time ago
so please check to see if these need to be revised.  If so, get aSHari to put
the revised terms into the red lined version.  Our changes are fairly
significant.  It is highly unlikely that they would agree to these terms
prior to our responding to their RFP.  I want to send them prices anyway.
This would be done by completing the Attachment A2 below.  Get prices from
Mike and Matt.

Thanks

Chris
