Stuart -

Attached are the chain of e-mails on the agreement.  I recommend a direct
red-line between the two agreements (what I sent them, and what they sent
back) before we mark up their letter.

They understand what we are doing with the plants, and I don't think will
have a problem with the changes we discussed.  I don't yet know what their
response to Brownsville will be however.

After you review the attached give me a call to discuss.

Mitch
