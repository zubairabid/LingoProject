Job Hunters' Mother Lode

Welcome to the inaugural issue of The Careers Insider,  the bi-weekly e-mail
newsletter of Business Week Online?s Careers Channel!

If you?ve already signed up for this newsletter, this is what you?ve been
waiting for.

If you haven?t, here?s the explanation: Because you already subscribe to  one
or more free Business Week Online newsletters,  we wanted to alert you to our
newest one, which keeps you updated with our  rapidly expanding Careers
channel. We thought it made sense to give you a sample of the newsletter
itself, so that if you like what you see, you can register  to keep receiving
it. If you decide not to, don?t worry: We won?t bother  you with this
suggestion again. Before you decide, however, you might want  to read on.

Our Business Partner. The Careers channel is a collaboration of Business
Week Online, the Web site of the world's most widely-read business
publication,  and LeadersOnline,  the Web-based arm of top executive
recruiter Heidrick & Struggles. The site's  filled with the information,
insights, resources, and advice you need to  help plan your career. This
newsletter gives you a sampling of the channel's  valuable offerings.

Once you're armed with such insights, you can use LeadersOnline's
executive-search  services by submitting your personal  profile. A
LeadersOnline representative can even guide you through a  resulting
interview process if that's appropriate. Perhaps at no other recruiting  site
will you receive such individual attention.

Thanks for visiting Business Week Online Careers. And please drop us a line
anytime at careers@businessweek.com  to let us how we?re doing!

A: Let's say you know how to manage a [research and development] environment.

people. Again, that goes back to the culture. We want people who are invested
in people, who are sincere about diversity and developing their staffs.

Q: How do you get at those skills when interviewing applicants?
A: If I get a manager from another company, I might ask what their
involvement has been in diversity initiatives. I would ask them to outline
their efforts around performance management. Time and again, you'll get
someone who has been extremely successful in managing a technical group, but
you get the sense that they're going to do that at the cost of some
employees. That's not something Corning is supportive of....
