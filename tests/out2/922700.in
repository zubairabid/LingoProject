HOUSTON - Enron Corp. hosted its annual equity analyst conference today in
Houston.  Ken Lay, Enron chairman and chief executive officer, opened the
conference by highlighting Enron,s tremendous growth across all businesses
and the outstanding 700 percent return to shareholders over the past decade.
Enron presented key objectives for 2000:
Continued strong growth in the core Wholesale Energy businesses.
Break-out performance from Retail Energy Services.
Rapid development of Enron Broadband Services.
Enron,s ability to extend core skills and competencies to new markets was a
recurring theme throughout the day.
Wholesale Energy Business
Growth prospects remain strong for Wholesale Energy Operations and Services,
Enron,s largest business.  Wholesale energy growth in North America is
expected to be driven by the continuing deregulation of power markets in the
United States and large-scale energy outsourcing by utilities and large
energy consumers.  Enron expects to continue to broaden its early lead across
the European continent as markets quickly open to competition.  Finally,
Enron is rapidly expanding its wholesale presence in other markets such as
Japan, where large customers will be permitted to choose their electricity
provider in March 2000.
EnronOnline will provide additional wholesale growth as incremental sales are
generated through this innovative, Internet-based transaction system.  Over
450 customers around the world have used EnronOnline and over 10,000
transactions have been completed since its introduction in late November
1999.  Yesterday, EnronOnline transaction levels reached a new record with
over 700 transactions, representing a notional value of $250 million.
Transaction processing costs with EnronOnline are significantly lower than
costs associated with traditional transaction methods.
Enron,s Gas Pipeline Group is also well positioned to continue growing, with
expansions planned or underway on several of its systems.
Retail Energy Services
With over 16,500 facilities under management, the infrastructure is in place
to service customers worldwide.  As the strong contracting momentum
continues, Enron Energy Services is poised to rapidly increase earnings in
2000.  Enron Energy Services, goal for 2000 is to sign new contracts
representing $16 billion in future expenditures by customers for energy and
energy services, nearly double the level in 1999.
