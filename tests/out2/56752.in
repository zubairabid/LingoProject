We received their redraft of the doc yesterday, it needed a lot of work.  We will return the draft on Monday morning.  We are combining the QSE contract into the Energy Management Agreement.  In addition, there is a master purchase agreement as well.  This results in quite a bit of legal work.  TECO indicated they are undermanned at this time and the turnaround will be slow. From a business concept standpoint we really don't have any "deal killer" issues.   I think we can get the deal done by the quarter's end at the latest and probably late next week.  But then depends on TECO's turnaround time.  Stuart Zisman and Mark Haedicke are going to meet with Lavo on Wednesday to talk legal risks associated with this deal and these types of deals.  I'll be there and I'll let you know the time in case your are interested.
