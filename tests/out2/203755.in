Last month you received an email about enrolling in the Enron PAC.  The
response has been positive.
Thank you to those of you that have already enrolled or made a change to your
current contribution!
If you have not had an opportunity to visit the enrollment site, please
consider taking a moment to do so.  The link to the website is at the end of
this message.

Some of you may have experienced problems launching the site or enrolling.
We apologize for any trouble that you may have had.  The enrollment works
best in either Internet Explorer or Netscape.  The most frequent problems
were a result of the Lotus Notes web browser that many employees have
installed as a default browser.  If this is your case, please copy and paste
the link at the end of this message into either Internet Explorer or Netscape.

As a reminder - Following is the original message regarding the PAC
enrollment:

Last year the Enron Political Action Committee (PAC) launched a campaign to
become a "million dollar PAC".  Enron employees, who provide all of the
funding for the PAC, responded and the Enron PAC reached its objective,
becoming one of the largest corporate PACs.  This year we face a new
challenge.  With the sale of EOG, the announced sale of PGE and normal
employee turnover, we have lost a significant number of consistent
contributors.  We are seeking your support.  If you are not a member, please
join.  If you are a member, we hope you will consider increasing your
contribution.

The Enron PAC is an essential tool in our effort to promote sound public
policy.  Our PAC funds support local, state and federal candidates, of both
parties, who support open markets, deregulation and customer choice.  Amounts
contributed may be used to make political contributions in connection with
federal and state elections and are subject to the limits of the Federal
Election Campaign Act.  While our PAC has grown thanks to our employee
contributions, it still generates just a fraction of the expenditures of
those who oppose these ideals.

This year, as always, we face challenges and opportunities for every one of
our businesses, including such issues as taxation and regulation of
e-commerce, electric industry restructuring, regulation of derivatives,
international trade and investment legislation, pipeline safety, local and
state decisions affecting the siting and interconnection of power plants and
a variety of environmental and tax issues.  Enron has a long and successful
track record of supporting and advancing good public policy.  That track
record depends on access to and regular communication with, decision makers.
The PAC provides that access - - it shows policy makers that real voters care
about what they are doing.

One of the best things about Enron is that we don,t just take things as they
are.  We challenge the status quo.  We ask why.  We change things.  The PAC
helps us do that.  We need you to help the PAC.  Sign up today ) and please
consider the following contribution guidelines:

You are free to contribute more or less than the guidelines suggested and
Enron will not favor or disadvantage anyone by reason of the amount of their
contribution or their decision not to contribute.  You may refuse to
contribute without fear of reprisal.

Only U.S. citizens and resident-aliens living in the U.S. can contribute to
the Enron PAC.  Amounts contributed may be used to make contributions in
connection with federal and state elections and are subject to the
limitations of the Federal Election Campaign Act.  The maximum contribution
is $5,000 per year per individual.  An individual may not contribute more
than $25,000 to all federal candidates and committees within a calendar
year.  The law requires that Enron report name, address, employer and
occupation for every person who contributes over $200/year.

federal income tax purposes.
