Today Paul and myself met with Ted Kerr and Martin James both partners at
Mallesons concerning the attached Request For  Proposal from ISDA. It relates
to  the possible development of an online site where electronic versions of
ISDA documentation could be accessed. There would be some other functionality
that would include a document negotiation,  processing/execution and storage
facility.
I understand the RFP was issued following an approach by Mallesons to ISDA
earlier this year. Apparently  whilst the ISDA Board was enthusiastic about
the idea and a demonstration website Mallesons had produced they thought it
appropriate to invite other proposals.
Mallesons is preparing an initial response to the RFP (due on 8  Sept) and
wanted to know if Enron was interested in collaborating. Our reputation in
the finance idustry, experience with online contracting and strong presence
in e-commerce  they see as a good fit with their skills.     Paul sees some
real potential and will be (or perhaps is already) talking to Networks. The
commercial interest primarliy relates to the "deal room" concept that would
require significant data storage data/transportation.
I wanted to acquaint you as soon as possible with this approach to check
whether Enron is involved in any other responses to the ISDA RFP. I note Mark
H. was a recipient of the RFP email and would be aware of this initiative.
Also as  the opportunities for Legal to bring in an e-commerce business
opportunity are rare it  would be a pity if we did not make every effort to
promote this one within Enron. Accordingly any observations you would have
would be greatly appreciated.
