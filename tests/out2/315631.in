Mark/Karen,
I received your voice mail regarding my comment about substituting the LOC.
The reason for this suggestion is to provide flexibility in our financing
structures, depending on which entities own equity in the LLC at the time of
the posting of the security.  Perhaps language such as  "an appropriate
payment security" or other similar language can be utilized. Please be
assured that I have an understanding of the differences between an LOC and a
corporate guaranty.
The draft responses have been forwarded to the Enron tax department, due to
the discussions concerning certain tax issues.  I believe it is appropriate
to get their approval of the language prior to these answers being released.
Also, I don't believe I fully appreciate the context of these questions and
answers, and how and to whom these answers will be given. A brief explanation
would be most appreciated.
Thank you,
