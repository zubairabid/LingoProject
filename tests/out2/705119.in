We received preliminary sample results yesterday. Sample #1 (TPH = 97 mg/kg)
and Sample #2 (TPH = 121 mg/kg) were collected from the east wall of the
excavation about 2 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about 4 feet below
ground surface. Sample #3 (TPH = 22400 mg/kg) was collected from the east
wall of the excavation about 8 feet outside the NNG facility fence and about
8-10 feet below ground surface. There was little visual evidence that this
soil sample was affected, but apparently it is.
In my discussions with Texaco's consultant, I inquired about their sample
analysis plan. He indicated that they were submitting soil samples for TPH
analysis by method 8015mod (GRO & DRO). I was concerned about comparing
results from the 8015mod analysis to our older data generated by method
418.1. In light of this I submitted our samples for analysis by method 418.1.
The 8015mod method is a more compound specific analysis than the 418.1 method
and often the more appropriate method to use. However, in this case it may
not be the most appropriate method. The 8015mod method is a GC method used to
measure the mass of hydrocarbon compounds that will elute within specific
time windows. The first time window is set up to measure the mass of gasoline
range organics (GRO). The second time window is set up to measure the mass of
diesel range organics (DRO). Any hydrocarbon compounds that elute after the
DRO time window are not measured. This would not be an issue if the soil was
contaminated with a light condensate, but Texaco's oil pit was reportedly
used to accumulate liquids not suitable for feed stock to the plant. I think
we can assume this meant heavy hydrocarbons. The 418.1 method is a less
sophisticated method that measures petroleum hydrocarbon compounds over a
wider range of carbon number, that is, it will measure the presence of
heavier hydrocarbons that would not be measured using method 8015mod. In
light of this, the 418.1 method is likely the more appropriate method for
assessing soil affected by the Texaco oil pit, particularly when results are
compared to older data generated using method 418.1.
I have requested our lab to confirm the results for Sample #3 using method
418.1. In addition, I have asked that they run the sample using method
8015mod (GRO & DRO) so that we can compare the two results. We should have
these results later next week. I would like to get this additional
information and discuss it among ourselves before we respond to Texaco. Right
now I am inclined to say that the Texaco oil pit is neither implicated or
cleared as the culprit of contamination found in NNG's monitor well MW-3.
