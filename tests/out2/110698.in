SHARE YOUR HOLIDAYS
Members of the Houston Texans front office, including Bob McNair and Charley
Casserly, donated clothing and canned goods Friday morning to KTRK/ABC-13,s
annual Share Your Holidays food drive.

Share Your Holidays is a community-wide effort sponsored by KTRK to collect
canned goods and other non-perishables for the needy in Houston and
surrounding areas. The Texans dropped off their items at the HEB Pantry Foods
store at the corner of Westheimer and Fountain View near the Galleria.

This year marks the 20th anniversary of KTRK,s Share Your Holidays. Last
year, the food drive helped collect 1,475,000 pounds of food at 45 sites.
More than 10 million pounds of food have been collected since 1980. Click
