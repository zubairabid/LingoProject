Can we create a San Juan phys for Oct bidweek?  What did we decide with this
product - swing only?  If we do, I would like to link it to the basis plus
nymex, or to the fixed price gas daily (fixed price gas daily will be rolled
out during bidweek this month because of our risk in gd basis going
forward).  I want to roll the Inside Ferc phys points out during bidweek 7-4,
as defined by Inside Ferc, last trade is mid.  The NGI index points will be
out 7 to 4 during bidweek, as defined by NGI.

We will plan on sending the data to both index publications.  Time open to
market, time of actual trade, counterparty, price, etc.  This will be
considered their last opportunity to be accurate or we will decline to
participate until their numbers are audited.

Thanks,
Mike
