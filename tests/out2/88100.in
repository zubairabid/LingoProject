established a Fundamentals Analysis Group.  Under the direction of Andrea
Reed, the group is similar to the others, with the objective of providing
market, industry, and regulatory information and identifying potential
commercial opportunities for originators and traders.  Doug Moreno and Carol
Marshall are the information experts.   They are presently working to
aggregate all of Enron,s various resources into a library and a website
(coming soon at http://eimfundy.dev.corp.enron.com/).  Jennifer Riley is the
quantitative analyst, and has already analyzed a number of statistical
relationships for the business entities to identify possible hedging
strategies.  Peggy Determeyer (steel) and Karen Carter (paper/pulp and
lumber) will be providing analytical services to the two primary product
lines. Tammy Davis keeps them all organized with terrific administrative
support.  Doug, Jennifer, Tammy, and Carol have followed Andrea from her
previous Merchant Asset Portfolio Management assignment, while Peggy and
Karen have joined from Enron South America and Enron North America,
respectively.  If you have any ideas for critical analyses or information
needs, contact one of them for help.

FINAL RESULTS FOR THE PULSE
Thanks to all who participated in Enron's annual employee survey.  The total
participation rate for ENA/EGM/EIM was 68.90%, which was an increase of
almost 20% from last year.  Additionally, we beat the Enron Corp. average
68.90% to 68.87%.  Some might say that this is statistically insignificant,
but we prefer to point out that a win is a win!

two things: specify exactly what you want and identify several bidders you
deem qualified to fight for the business. Let your imagination roam. At Enron
they never stop thinking about new products and services for which they can
make markets. First gas and electricity, now bandwidth, ocean shipping,
paper, and much else."
