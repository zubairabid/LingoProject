Anything over 250, in my book is "DREAM TEAM" status, as those of you who
were with us in '98 will remember how excited we were to get to that level.
It's happened again! - as of this moment, we have 293 registered riders, and
we have room for more - so please be in touch if you have anyone else to add
to the team.  (A handful of you who've told me you're not riding are still on
the list - we're hoping you'll change your mind, and  also we get numbers
credit for the amount of people registered.)

The deadline has passed for registering for $25.  As of today, registration
is $35, and if you are a member of the cycling club, you will from this point
forward need to register yourself and request a reimbursement from Stephanie
Strong.

Many thanks to Becky Pham, Uniform Officer, and Stephanie Strong, Treasurer,
who are handling jersey distribution.  It's going very well under their
supervision.  And thanks to John Norden for chairing the jersey design
process.  Please get in touch with Becky Pham at 713-345-7094 or Stephanie
Strong at 713-853-1653 to get your jersey reserved and/or picked up.  The
jerseys have caused quite a "stir" and it'll be great to see them on the road.

HERE'S TEAM ENRON 2000 !
