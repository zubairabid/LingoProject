Internet Tip of the Day
Wednesday December 6, 2000

Kid-Safe Browsing

Parents are right to be worried about their children seeing "adult" content
on the Internet. Pornography is the biggest worry for most, but so are Nazi
and hate group sites, sites advocating drugs, and online scams and frauds.
Parents can take control of the Web in the home with the help of security
software like Net Nanny. There are others, but Net Nanny is one of the most
popular with parents. Net Nanny's filtering software blocks objectionable
sites on your home PC. It can be configured a variety of ways. It "limits
access to material that parents deem inappropriate, prevents the threat of
'Cyber Strangers,' and denies the misuse of personal information such as
credit cards and phone numbers." You can create customized lists for every
family member, and you can check to see where users have been. Kids today are
usually more skilled with computers than their parents. Parents have come to
rely on Net Nanny and other products and services like it! to help them keep
their kids away from inappropriate online content. If censorship is the
answer, it should begin at home.
