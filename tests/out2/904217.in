Book Search Engines

If you're a book collector, or a bargain hunter, or if you need an
out-of-print title, then try some of the used book search engines on the Web.
These link together hundreds of small (and not-so-small) bookstores coast to
coast and in other countries, letting you search hundreds of inventories for
the right book. You can search title, author, publisher, and other
attributes, like hardbound or paperback, dust jacket, first edition, etc.
Condition is listed, too. You often get multiple hits for titles, giving you
a choice of prices. Collectors can find what they need to round out their
favorite authors. Bargain hunters can find used copies of out-of-print books.
You can purchase the books online, too. Two of the best are ABE and Alibris.
Both give you lots of search options.

Visit ABE.

Try Alibris.
