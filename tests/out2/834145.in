Hey guys and girls, there are three things you need  to announce tomorrow
night at NEON.

1) Get a count  of the kids in your group who need to go to the
retreat late. There is a  van leaving later Friday night, due to a several
kids who are participating in a  Northland basketball game. There is only
one van, and priority will be for  the kids playing and girls cheering. Get
a count of those who need to go  late (it might even be good to get their
names). You can email this  information to beckyp@bammel.org
2) The  toilet bowl will be at the NCS field at 2:00, unless the
field is wet, and then  it will be moved to the Strack Middle school field.
3) There will  be a superbowl party at Scott Simpson's home starting
at 5:30. Girls bring  sweets, guys bring chips and dips.

It looks like a busy weekend for the kids!  Have a great NEON.

Bobby
