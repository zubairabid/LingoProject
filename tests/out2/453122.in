Portal.
The list of HR employees to receive the IM Portal Survey is pending
approval.  HR is delayed because of compensation responsibilities.  Temporary
delay will not impact pilot deliverables.

The technical team is creating portal templates for the respective Business
Units/Functional Units.  Each template will reflect BU/FU content, a similar
&look and feel8, a dynamic technical platform (a platform which can be easily
updated), and a secure platform (a platform which reflects the latest single
sign on effort).

The production server for the portal is being built.

myhome.enron.com is being targeted as the portal name.  Brandon Rigney has
been consulted to provide user experience input and ensure a smooth
transition of current users from the former myhome.enron.com site to the new
best practices IM Task Force myhome.enron.com portal.

IM Task Force is investigating IT pilot project for single sign-on
application.  The Task Force intends to provide a single sign-on interface
for all applications accessible from portal

Unstructured Data Management/Enterprise Search Engine tool.
A request has been made for vendors (Autonomy, Verity and Inktomi) to
provide the IM Software Selection Team with a proof of concept evaluation and
customer references.

The SST is having a challenge getting software prices from all three
vendors.  GSS will be requested to support this effort at this early stage.

Each of the vendors license their software in a different manner.  Inktomi,
s licenses are based on number of documents indexed, Autonomy,s licenses are
based on number of end users, and Verity,s can be a combination of server
instance and end users.  The inability to accurately predict numbers of
documents, users, and server instances makes a side-by-side comparison
difficult.

The SST is continuing to work on the software evaluation report.  Customer
feedback and pricing will be incorporated as it becomes available.

IM Strategy Proposal.
Momentum from the pilot phase of this project is needed for the delivery
stage ) the stage where we take what we have developed for a pilot and bring
it to Enron corporate-wide.  To do so, an IM executive coordinator needs to
be identified ASAP.

Allan Sommer is meeting with Price Waterhouse and Ernst & Young and will
collect information on Knowledge/Information Management.

Although this project has task force accountability and timelines, no one
executive has accountability for the budget.  True accountability lies within
the organization which has a defined, approved budget for the project.

Information presented at last week,s Analyst meeting appears to support the
need for a formalized, executive sponsored IM program.

The IM Task Force is meeting with EES next week to discuss the information
released at the analyst meeting.
