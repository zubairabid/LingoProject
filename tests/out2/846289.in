Chris, as per our discussion, I just want to confirm that we have the ability
to break the contract with the EPC provider at any time.  Further, I want to
confirm that our costs will be minimal and that this whole process (ie
putting a number on a term sheet) has been based on trying to maximize the
short run value of the project.  In other works, we have no intention of
lifting their offer.  Finally, we are not ordering HRSG's or steam turbines.
These guys add no value and they are killing me!
