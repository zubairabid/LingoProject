The list attached below sets out the tentative guests at your Church Gourmet
Party on May 13.  Some of these persons have confirmed that they will be
attending, but approximately half have not confirmed.  Please call all of
your guests in the next few days to invite them to your home and introduce
yourself.  You may set the time of the party to suit your own schedule and
entertainment style.  After you have a final guest list, please e-mail me
with your final list so that I can add one or more additional persons who are
on our reserve list if you have space.  If you have too many persons who
cancel or too many who accept, we have time to do some balancing among the
party groups.  Ideally each party will have 10-12 persons when we are
finished.

Penny Linsenmyer is preparing the recipes for this party and will have them
complete early next week.  The menu is a back-yard grill special with an
emphasis on casual, easy summer foods.  We hope that the weather will
cooperate to allow all of us to entertain out doors this time.  If you don't
have a grill, let me know ASAP and we'll find a way for you to borrow one.
Casual tableware (including nice paper/plastic) is fine.  It is perfectly
acceptable and appropriate to ask guests to bring serving utensils and other
items you might not have.  It is also acceptable to set up card tables and
similar casual seating if you have more guests than you usually seat.

Most guests have participated in at least one party by now and know the
routine.  But you should remind guests to bring a bottle of wine or other
beverage to share.

Our menu is as follows:

Black Bean Dip to be served with chips/bread or veggies
Roasted Red Pepper Dip
Gaspacho Soup with Shrimp with French Bread Loaves (paper cups are fine for
serving this)
Grilled thick-cut pork chops and chicken breasts with mango/basil sauce - to
be cooked on the grill at the host's home
Scalloped Potatoes
Death by Chocolate

All of the recipes are easy-moderate.  No tricky ingredients or culinary
skills this time.  Nonetheless, you might ask your guests their first choice
of recipe.

All of your guests are listed in the Church Directory.  Please call the
Church Office at 713-523-2864 if you can't find a telephone number.  Also, I
have found e-mail is a great way to circulate info and recipes.  You might
ask your guests if they use e=mail and if they will share their address.

Thanks for your help.
