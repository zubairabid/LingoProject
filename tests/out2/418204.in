Susan Bailey, the paralegal working on this master, spoke to the Company
after receiving these emails.  They faxed to her a copy of the assumed  name
certificate wherein Northern Illinois Gas Company transacts business under
the name Nicor Gas Company.  Per her conversations they have not changed
their name, they are only operating under the assumed name Nicor Gas
Company.  Being so, the online account would have to be renamed as Northern
Illinois Gas company dba Nicor Gas Company.  Per my conversation with Stacy
Dickson, a physical gas lawyer, they still transact physical gas under their
master with Northern Illinois Gas Company.  I will have a copy of the assumed
name certificate walked down to Adnan.  If we are all in agreement after
this, it seems like we need two counterparty names "Northern Illinois Gas
Company" and "Northern Illinois Gas Company dba Nicor Gas Company".  Upon
receipt of the assumed name certificate, please confirm your agreement and I
will contact Credit and the Online team.
