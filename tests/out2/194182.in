Ken,

I had to respond.

Speaking of bitch....all of the Cornhusker fans are bitching about Stoops
not  taking the head coach position at the Cleveland Browns or any other job
that will get him out of their backyard.  By the way, Stoops just started
working on his book "OU's 7th Football National Championship"; Chapter 3, Who
are the Huskers?
