It has been brought to our attention that the Underwriters Lock-up Agreement,
prepared by our outside counsel and forwarded to you last week, included an
incorrect reference regarding the market on which the Common Stock of TNPC,
Inc. is to be traded following the planned IPO.

On page 2 of the document, in the verbiage following item (iii), the 8th line
of copy which reads as follows:

(X) the reported last sale price of the Common Stock on the Nasdaq National
Market is at least ...

Should read as follows:

(X) the reported last sale of the Common Stock on The New York Stock Exchange
is at least ...

When we receive all of the completed Underwriters Lock-up Agreements, we plan
to correct the second page containing the incorrect reference prior to
forwarding the completed Lock-up Agreements.   We just wanted you to be aware
that this change was being made to the documents.

REMINDER:  We hope to receive the completed Agreements prior to the end of
September and prior to the pricing of the IPO on the New York Stock
Exchange.  Thank you to those who have already forwarded their completed
documents to us.
