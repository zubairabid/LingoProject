Kay,
Attached is the LM 6000 and options scope that ESA has prepared, that will
be input to our MOU.  It does not reflect the scope of equipment that will be
procured from ABB yet; this should be forthcoming.  Also below is the current
cost estimate of the machines with their S&S options and the ABB scope.
Please let us know what other information regarding scope that you might
need.
