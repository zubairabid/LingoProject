Paul,
Thanks for the update.  With regard to further interference from the PUCN,
and the comment that the PUCN must approve each generation divestiture of
Sierra, do we anticipate any of these (the generation divestitures) closing
prior to the Sierra/PGE closing?
I'll check with CSFB to get their perspective.
Thanks,
Mitch
