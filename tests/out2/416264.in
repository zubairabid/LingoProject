Larry Gagliardi has been talking to Valero Marketing and Supply Company about
doing some gas crack business, and it appears Valero  will not trade with us
under the current form of Master Swap Agreement we have in place with them.
They will only trade under their form of ISDA Master, a copy of which is
attached below.  I spoke to their lawyer, Kim Bowers, who is very nice, and
she asked us to make our comments to their form by email.   After talking to
Tanya while you were out, it appears that we need to revisit their credit
situation since the credit under our existing master swap is quite old.  We
will try to work on reviewing the legal terms while we wait to get the credit.
