pedantic (pe-DAN-tik) adjective

Characterized by a narrow, often ostentatious concern for book learning
and formal rules.

Vulgar Latin *paedens, -paedent-, present participle of -paedere, to
instruct, probably from Greek paiduein, from pais, paid-, child + -ic.]

"Mr Updike uses different names for his characters... But the name
changes are jarring, and their flavour is pedantic, as if Mr Updike
simply wants credit for doing his homework."

Men seek out retreats for themselves in the country, by the seaside, on the
moutains... But all this is unphilosophical to the last degree... when thou
canst at a moment's notice retire into thyself. -Marcus Aelius Aurelius
