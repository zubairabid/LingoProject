GREENFIELD CAPITAL PROJECTS

Cuiaba Pipeline (Bolivia/Brazil)- Joe Kolb reports that construction in the
Ridges is now proceeding in all areas.  Directional drilling of some of the
Ridges is progressing more slowly than originally anticipated due to the
hardness of the limestone.  Specialists are being called in.  Restoration of
disturbed areas is being accomplished at a rapid pace in anticipation of the
onset of the rainy season.  Joe will be going to inspect the route along with
Edgar Zuleta (Corp EH&S South America) next week.

RioGen/Eletrobolt PPs (Brazil)- Joe Kolb is waiting for a pipeline
reroute-specific conference call to be scheduled (as per the last project
conference call) to discuss the issues.  Joe conferred with Lauren Goldblatt
and John Ayers (Enron SA) and John is working to ensure that the conference
call is scheduled and to ensure that the school/orphanage is avoided.  Bob
Moss will be presenting his route findings to Lauren, Joe, Susan W., John
Ayers, Lisa Alderman (Enron SA), and Keith Micelli on Friday, Oct. 26.

Metgas Pipeline (India) - Joe Kolb reports that the approval of the two
laterals from the Metgas mainline may delay the overall project.  Lauren
Goldblatt offered wise counsel on alternative ways to obtain government
concurrence without having a full-blown public hearing.  The goal is to close
financing by the end of March 2001.  Main controversy is not related to
environmental matters but associated with ROW acquisition.

Powertel - Joe Kolb received considerable information from Annat Jain (Enron
India) on this fiber optic project.  It appears that it will have minimal
environmental impacts because the cable is being suspended aerially from the
existing electric transmission towers and is being buried only at
substations.  Impacts will mainly be from the equipment moving along the
corridor.

ACQUISITIONS

Project Crane (Quebec, Canada and Port Angeles, Washington) - Don Stevens has
been informed that Enron did submit a non-binding bid for Quebec City.  We
are currently in negotiations over the terms of our bid and there is at least
one other bidder still in the hunt.  We won't make it to the next round
unless we can resolve the terms and conditions sticking points. No further
due diligence is planned at this time.

Project INGA (California and Pennsylvania) - Don Stevens reviewed DASH
(draft) from George Schaefer.  Environmental issues have been addressed in
the DASH.

Military Base Privatization (Maxwell AFB/Gunter Annex) -  Joe Kolb provided
direction to Stephan Laroche (Enron OEC) on how to develop information
requested for operating the wastewater systems.  The information related to
tracking waste disposal.

CWT Thermo-Depolymerization - Don Stevens is preparing an environmental
issues matrix for the various feedstocks which may be used in the process.

Project Delta - Don Stevens has completed the review of Dames & Moore's
Preliminary Environmental Reviews of four potential underground natural gas
storage well locations.  The proposed locations are in the states of
Washington, Utah and New Mexico.

Project Toucan -  After meeting with Georgia Pacific management,  Enron is
not interested in the Brunswich, GA site due to the product being
manufactured.  Enron's offer would not be as competitive as others.  Also,
Enron is not interested in the Woodland Mill as it appears that they have
operational issues.  Enron will send a couple of engineers to the site for
review.  Enron will only be bidding on the Leaf River, MS site.  Given the
altered scope, no work is required in evaluating Brunswick.  By November 1,
2000 Enron will decide whether to submit a bid for Woodland.  Georgia Pacific
still requires that binding bids be submitted by mid-November and this date
will apply to both Leaf River and Woodland.  The current schedule has the
management approval process beginning on November 9, 2000.  Don Stevens
conducted a review of documents supplied by Georgia Pacific regarding the
Leaf River site.  Don Stevens will be conducting a due diligence site visit
of the Leaf River facility on October 29 - 30, 2000.

DEPARTMENT PROJECTS

BMPs - Joe Kolb distributed all three linear facility BMPs to the Enron EH&S
Council for their review.  All comments have been received and evaluated for
the Pipeline BMPs.  Joe Kolb sent the Fiber Optic BMPs to Wilson Dietrich
(EBS) for his review and comments. The Electric Transmission Line BMPs were
sent to Bob Moss (EE&CC) for his review and who passed them on to Dennis
Alexander (EE&CC) for his staff to review.  Initial responses are positive.

EHS Guidelines - The Environmental Sub-Committee (of the EHS Council) will
conduct a review of the Enron EHS Guidelines and lead the effort to revise
them to ensure that they have a broader scope to cover Enron's diverse asset
portfolio (power, pipelines, pulp/paper mills, metal recycling, etc.).  This
effort will include the identification of EHS BMPs and will likely include
the construction BMPs Joe Kolb has been developing.

EHS Intranet Site - Gavin Dillingham continues to work on the EHS intranet
site. The target date for launch of the site is now December 1st. Most
content has been received for the site. We are also waiting on the approval
of the Renewable Portfolio Standard information from the Environmental
Strategies group and the Regulatory and Legislative Reports from Marc
Phillips. These two items should be approved by the end of the week.

Life Cycle Analysis Phase I - A.D. Little has completed their identification
of Enron's products and services.  A meeting will be held either Friday, Oct.
26 or Monday, Oct. 30 to discuss follow-up questions with the business
units.

VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES/COMMUNITY RELATIONS

Solar Panel Donation - Joe Kolb and Michael Terraso visited  the Armand Bayou
Nature Center last week, discuss their use of the panels, and have agreed to
donate the panels.

Enron Earth Day Festival/Buffalo Bayou Challenge - Joe Kolb and Gavin
Dillingham have developed a proposal for how to implement a possible "Bayou
Challenge," which would be a bayou cleanup activity.  A meeting with
Community Relations folks to discuss the proposal will occur on October
26th.  The Corporate EHS group will participate in a trial run December 8th
to work out the kinks.

REGULATORY TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

INGAA NSR Task Group - Marc Phillips is heading a newly formed INGAA Task
Group on New Source Review. The first conference call for the group is
scheduled for this Friday.

EPA Regulatory Activities - Marc Phillips distributed to Enron personnel a
listing of 88 actions, mostly regulatory, that EPA plans on taking between
now and January 20, 2001. Fourteen of the actions were identified as having
an impact on Enron. This information was presented at the EH&S Council
meeting.

TNRCC Commissioners Work Session - Marc Phillips attended the TNRCC
Commissioner's Work Session where the Commission directed TNRCC staff to lift
the temporary hold on the review of certain New Source Review (NSR) permit
applications. This hold had affected applications for new permits and permit
amendments received after September 18, 2000, which would authorize new
emissions of NOx in the eight-county Houston/Galveston ozone non-attainment
area.

Office and Field Ergonomics Safety Procedures - Russell Tucker issued the
second draft of the proposed "Enron Office Ergonomics Program" safety
procedure and the first draft of the "Enron Field Ergonomics Program -
Construction" safety procedure for review and comment by the members of the
Enron EH&S Council.

Enron Houston Accident and Injury Reporting, Investigation and Recordkeeping
- Russell Tucker assembled the final three forms necessary to complete the
attachments to the "Enron Houston Accident and Injury Reporting,
Investigation and Recordkeeping" procedure commissioned by the Enron EH&S
Safety Sub-council for development. The procedure is awaiting review by
Maryann Roman De Meza, after which it will be released for review and comment
by the Safety Sub-council members.

ADVOCACY

Pipeline Safety Legislation  - While there is still a slim chance that the
Senate (McCain) legislation may be included in a last-minute appropriations
package, most Capitol Hill sources are pessimistic that a bill will be passed
this Congress. The Administration, concerned that it could shoulder the blame
for killing safety legislation in Congress, is planning an "Executive
Action," which will likely take the form of a Clinton Executive Order, paired
with the release of a DOT rule on integrity management for liquid pipelines
(which was expected shortly anyway.)

MTBE Legislation -- S. 2962, which passed the Senate Environment Committee in
September is not expected to be included in any last-minute appropriations
legislation.  The issue will likely be addressed next Congress.  Enron has
secured commitments of several key members of Congress that "transition
incentives" for MTBE producers will be considered along with any legislation
to ban or limit the product.

Clean Air Act/"Multi-Pollutant" Legislation -- it is likely that next
Congress will consider CAA reform legislation, and much attention is already
being paid to approaches to reducing emissions of multiple pollutants (SO2,
NOx, Mercury, CO2) from the electric generation sector while also fixing
problems with the New Source Review program.   Out of concern that merchant
gas generation, distributed generation, energy efficiency and other "clean"
solutions might be left out of the discussions, Jeff Keeler and consultant
Joel Bluestein organized a meeting of environmental groups and competitive
generation companies (PG&E Gen, Calpine, Trigen, NiSource, El Paso) to talk
about the inclusion of clean energy/IPPs in a multi-pollutant bill.   We will
be drafting a legislative solution in the coming weeks so that it can be
circulated with environmental groups, utilities, and eventually Capitol Hill
and new Administration representatives by the start of next Congress.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE/COMMERCIAL SUPPORT

Clean Air Act/NOx SIP Call Supreme Court Appeal -  The states of Ohio,
Indiana, Alabama, Michigan, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia have
petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an appeal of the NOx SIP call case,
which was upheld in favor of EPA by a federal appeals court earlier this
year.   The states (backed by some industry groups) are hoping that the case
will be linked in the minds of the justices to the EPA's appeal of the NAAQS
8-hour standard case, which will be heard by the Supreme Court on November 6.
(even though one case held for EPA and the other against)   If the Court
decides the two cases are related this could delay a decision until later
next year, and perhaps sway the court into finding against EPA in the SIP
case as well.

Clean Air Act/Energy Efficiency -  Mary Schoen is working on several issues
related to the use of energy efficiency projects to generate tradable
allowances/offsets in NOx control programs.  Indiana is developing its NOx
SIP, and because of the excess of allowances in its budget, would be a prime
target for including energy efficiency set-asides. EES is interested in
creating such a program, and Mary is working with EES and some of its Indiana
customers to advocate the use of energy efficiency projects to meet NOx
reduction targets.  Mary is also working in California to find offsets for
ENA new generation, and has talked with the Bay Area AQMD about using EES
energy efficiency projects to generate offsets.  Stacey Bolton met with the
Center for Resource Solutions, who is developing a "Negawatt" program in PA,
and informed EES who could benefit from participation with commercial
customers in a pilot program.

EES Premium Power Group - The Environmental Strategies team has been working
with EES' new venture into power quality, distributed generation and
reliability to assist them with intelligence about environmental drivers for
their business.  Jeff Keeler introduced EES to DOE and EPA officials working
on power quality issues, as potential sources of information, policy support
and funding.  Mary Schoen is working on a "template" environmental
regulations affecting distributed generation.   Mary is also working to
address a new Texas regulatory proposal that would severely restrict
distributed generation.  Stacey Bolton provided a summary of incentive monies
available for fuel cells and renewable resources.    We expect to provide
substantial support for this EES business as they organize in the next
several months.

California Retail Electric Market -   New Power Company is taking over EES'
residential customers in the California retail market, and Stacey Bolton is
working with NPC to advise them on regulations and reporting procedures
related to the provision of green power products to customers.  Stacey is
also advising NPC on markets in Ohio, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.

Energy Efficiency/California Pilot Project - SDG&E is looking to create a
pilot project to offer competitive energy providers the chance to take over
some of its residential customers and offer a "bundled" package of energy &
services, including many energy efficiency solutions.   Mary Schoen is
working with NPC on potential business opportunities related to this pilot
program.

Green-E Outreach to Commercial Customers -  Green-E is doing some outreach to
commercial sources about certification under the Green-E program, and Stacey
Bolton has been meeting with Green-E to discuss potential business
opportunities for Enron associated with green power offerings to these
commercial customers.

Climate Change -  Jeff Keeler spoke on a panel at the Forbes Magazine
Environmental Superconference in DC, on the topic of Business Opportunities
related to Climate Change.   Jeff also helped organize a briefing by the
White House and EPA for gas industry representatives, to hear about proposals
related to establishing baselines to show "additionally" under the CDM and JI
mechanisms, which will be a hot topic for discussion at COP 6 in the Hague.
