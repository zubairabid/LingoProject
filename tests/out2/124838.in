Dan, I will be sending you my comments on the
Subordination Agreement shortly, but wanted to ask one
question in the meantime--is the legal description set forth in
the Subordination Agreement the correct legal description for
the property--I wanted to give further information to the title
company in undertaking their search of the records.  Let me
know.  Thanks.
