Dear all,

Attached is Anjam's reasoning and final version of the UK PPI PLLU model.

The UK Inflation Book's main exposure is to two PPI indexes - the PLLU and
the DZCV through year 2010. Both are PPI Output indexes with very comparable
baskets. The only significant difference between the two is the presence of
energy in the PLLU (7.6%). The model in use escalates the two indexes by the
same factors. However, with the energy price fluctuations in recent years
different models for the two indexes would reflect better the nature of their
drivers. Anjam concentrated on the PLLU index first and he will shortly
construct one for the DZCV based on the same methodology, but without the
Brent Crude curve.

The new model achieves the two main objectives of the PPI curve: it is
significantly more robust and stable than the existing one, and it is
considerably less sensitive to the input coefficients. This will result in us
having more confidence in our monthly P&L as well as less fluctuations.

Best regards,

Martina
