Dear Sara,

Last week I sent an email with an offer to try ShareBuilder.com and we'd
provide $50 to help get you started.  We had an overwhelming response from
our Netstock Direct customers so I thought I'd send a friendly reminder
message.  If you haven't taken advantage of this great offer yet, you still
can but hurry - you need to open an account and set up a plan before the
offer expires on October 31st, 2000.

$50 OFFER EXTENDED TO FAMILY AND FRIENDS
Many Netstock Direct customer wrote back asking if they could introduce their
family and friends to ShareBuilder and if they too would be eligible for the
$50 'Get Started' promotion.  I'm pleased to announce that WE WILL HONOR the
request so feel free to email this message and the URL below to anyone you
think would enjoy hearing about ShareBuilder and receiving $50 to help them
with their long-term investing plans.
