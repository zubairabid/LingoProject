Dear John,

I spoke with Sara this morning and she is going to speak with you again and
send me some suggested language.  I am a bit confused though and wonder if
you can explain.  When I first mentioned this to the bank I told them that as
(if) their credit rating went down, their credit limit would drop (so by
implication there would not necessarily be any event of default).  Is this
the case or would a drop in their credit rating from "A" automatically
trigger an event of default.  The former will of course make it much easier
to sell them our proposal (involving us having the option to post collateral
before there can be an event of default).  Sorry if I sound a bit vague but
this is all still a bit new to me.

Secondly, we now have their replies to our comments on the various
outstanding issues and I will forward these to you now for your input
(including on the threshold amount point).
