You may be interested to know that on July 20, 2000 the Alberta Minister of
Resource Development signed the new Market Surveillance Amendment Regulation
into law.   The new regulation made four changes to the existing Market
Surveillance Regulation, namely:

(a) it gave the MSA the new authority to monitor the conduct of the PPA
Owners in relation to compliance with their obligations under the PPAs;
(b) it gave complaintants a mechanism to appeal a decision of the MSA not to
further investigate a complaint to the Power Pool Council;
(c) it retained the mandatory referral mechanism by the MSA to another agency
if the MSA's investigation determines the matter falls within another
agency's jurisdiction (i.e. Competition Bureau) but has eliminated the
requirement that upon such a referral the MSA cease its own investigation.
The Power Pool Council now has the authority to determine whether the MSA
should carry on with its investigation after a referral, or not.
(d) it added a section relating to the MSA's authority to apply to the Court
for an order authorizing it to take evidence outside of Alberta.
