Bruce just fyi, I am already on top of this.  Ken Blades and I had a
conversation with Justin Williams yesterday about this ongoing saga (which
has been ongoing a long time...).  Essentially here's where we are and why it
is a good thing that United India has sued us in the London Court.

In the early part of the dispute, we gave consideration to litigation vs.
arbitration, but we could only sue UI in India, which was a bad option.

Several months ago, after lengthy settlement discussions with United India
(UI) and reinsurers about DPC's DSU claim resulting from the first rotor
problems, UI served DPC with a notice of arbitration under the policy.  The
notice was curious because UI clearly disputed both liability and quantum;
however, the policy's arbitration clause states that arbitration can only
include issues of quantum.

Through a series of correspondence, we believe UI has agreed to arbitrate
liability & quantum in the same proceeding and to include reinsurers in the
arbitration.  (The cut through clause in the policy enables DPC to recover
directly from the reinsurers).  It appears, however, (at least we speculate)
that UI has suddenly become uncomfortable with the anomaly, that while they
have served DPC a notice of arbitration, the clause limits arbitration to
quantum, not liability.  Hence UI's declaratory judgment action in the London
Commercial Court to determine liability.  Now, this gives us an option we
didn't have earlier: litigation in the London court since they have submitted
to jurisdiction  or arbitration.  There are pros & cons to both which we are
discussing with Justin and Peter.

An interesting piece of the puzzle is that UI is now trying to realign the
parties since DPC is the insured seeking recovery.    The reason UI wants to
do this is because (i) it would put the burden of proof on DPC as claimant &
(ii) UI as claimant will have a very difficult time meeting its burden of
proof on a dec action because they do not have all the technical information
DPC has.
Pros of litigation: The London court is less likely to permit this
realignment than arbitrators who are typically more lenient in procedural
matters of this type.  We also believe the London court will be cheaper (no
cost of  3 arbitrators) and quicker, since there are statutory time lines.
UI has no incentive to resolve this expeditiously and has, at every
opportunity, slowed the arbitration process by rejecting everything DPC
proposes from the number of arbitrators to the names submitted etc.  Also, in
the London court, there is a strong possibility DPC can get an advance
security for attorneys' fees as the defendant, which is not possible in
arbitration.
Downside of litigation:  It is less likely that DPC can litigate directly
against the reinsurers for procedural reasons.  Furthermore, DPC could
potentially end up in two proceedings: litigation to determine liability &
arbitration to determine quantum which could take longer and be expensive.
Ken Blades believes the loss adjuster stipulated to quantum in a prior
meeting which would enable us to avoid that scenario.  Until we see the
document, however, we cannot determine whether the stipulation  is
enforceable because of issues of authority etc.

The bottom line is, now that UI has sued us in London court, we have a choice
we didn't have before.  We plan to obtain Ken's document re the stipulation,
send a letter to UI and then see their reaction before we decide. Now that
we've been served it just shortens our time limit to do this.  I'm inclined
to go the litigation route, but I want to see that stipulation document first
and discuss with Linklaters its value either as an enforceable agreement or
its strength as evidence of quantum.  Call me if you have questions.  In the
meantime I'll keep you informed.
