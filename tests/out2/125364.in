I forgot to give you her number in the last email.  It is 53218.  I apologize
for her not calling you as well as myself.  I talked to her immediately after
we spoke and she assured my she was going to call immediately.  I did not
spend much time on the phone with her but the little bit I did get was that
she did not see that meter on any of her nomination reports and was not aware
of any gas from them.  Also, generally, if a producer does not agree with a
nomination from their supply points, they just don't confirm it.  If it was
suppose to be confirmed, the phone calls will start at that time.
Again, I apologize for not giving you her name immediately.  Hopefully the
problem is or will be resolved quickly.  Let me know if there is anything
else I can help with.
