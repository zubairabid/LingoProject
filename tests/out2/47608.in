Guys,

Puget is claiming that we did a real-time deal with their trader, Lisa, on
October 17 HE 20.  The terms are 20MW purchased from Puget at a rate of
$115.  We cannot find anything in the Inc or Services sheet, and nothing is
in EnPower.   Please look in your trade books for this deal to confirm.  I
will get more information from Puget if I can, but so far, that's all I know.

Thanks,

Caroline

PS  Please respond to Virginia on this, whether you did the deal or not.
