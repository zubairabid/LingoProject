Greg,

I didn't realize you were doing that, that's great.  I am sure they need your
help, so few people are willing to give back to their old collegiate
experiences.  My thanks as a Sig Ep.

I just changed jobs within Enron  (again) and have had a wild and difficult
morning and your email made me chuckle.  I have done a few things at OU, and
may be coming up in Sept. for a speech, and I'm not sure what pictures you
are talking about.  The business school took some pictures and so did the
Energy Management Program (the old PLM school) but I have not seen them nor
do i know what they did with any they took.  If you are talking about a
formal picture, I could provide one with my corporate bio if you need it for
some reason.

Thanks for the chuckle,
mike

PS:  I have been called a lot of things including "that God damned
McConnell"  but that is as close as it gets.
