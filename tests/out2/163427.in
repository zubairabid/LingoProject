The following is a summary of the attached Edison prehearing conference
statement filed this afternoon in the proceeding dealing with its Petition
for  Modification of the end-of-the-rate-freeze decisions:
Edison says there are There are four key elements to managing the  situation:
Support market reform, including providing greater freedom for  utilities
to contract for longer term supplies of power, completing review  of SCE,s
bilateral contract proposals, and urging other agencies to help  rectify the
market structure problems that have become apparent.
Confirm that the utilities will be permitted to recover their  reasonable
procurement costs incurred on behalf of customers.
Protect customers by implementing a post-freeze rate stabilization  plan
instead of the current plan which directs immediate pass through  of
volatile wholesale power costs. This should include a modest  near-term
energy rate increase of around 10% in the interest of avoiding a  much larger
rate
increase in 2002 and thereafter.
Promptly decide whether the Commission is going to permit the sale  of
the utilities, remaining generation assets. If the answer is &no,8  then
fundamental changes in the implementation of electric  restructuring
would have to be considered. Either way, all parties need  the
Commission,s answer to this key question as soon as possible.
Interestingly, Edison says that, "Based on the valuations SCE has filed for
our hydro facilities, Palo Verde, Mohave and Four Corners (no one has argued
that these valuations are too high), our stranded costs (for the purpose of
Section 368(a)) were recovered no later than
mid-August  2000. The Commission should approve our pending plant valuations
as  soon as possible so that the Commission can put in place a reasonable
ratestabilization plan, including a modest energy rate increase beginning in
January 2001, to deal with the necessary costs of procuring power."
