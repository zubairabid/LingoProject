Kay-
I will look at your copy of the LLC regarding delegation of powers (or if I
can't find it, I will get a copy from the Corporate Secretary's office).
The draft CA does not mention Peoples having to get their consultants to sign
the CA, but I can put something in.
Where are you?  I talked to Carlos today and I believe he will be with us
soon (if we can hire him).  He is anxiously awaiting your return from NY.
