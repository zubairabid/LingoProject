Attached is the agreement in principle reached today between TCPL and its
Stakeholders on terms TCPL is prepared to bring to the board if there is
broad enough industry support.

The following are the key changes from the draft distributed on Monday Feb 12.
Discretionary revenue sharing  to TCPL subject to cap of $5M (from $7.5M)
with higher sharing percentages by revenue class.
AOS of 4% (from 2.5%) of FT demand charge paid as credit to IT invoice.  4%
is approx 240 mmcfd.
IT floor to be railed between 80% and 120% of FT toll but floating monthly
with marginal fuel cost.

There are two very controversial elements that may cause some parties to
litigate.  TCPL has slipped in the severance costs for 200 employees that
were laid off in Dec 2000 but technically terminated in 2001.  At $100K per
employee this works out to $20 m or about one cent on the Eastern Zone toll.
TCPL is also not willing to consider liquidating this year any of their 8 bcf
of storage working gas and are not even conceding that the gas belongs to the
shippers.  Speculation is they have arbed much of it  this winter and are
trying to pocket all of the upside with no benefit to the shippers who paid
for it.

If TCPL proceeds with this agreement without opposition then there will be a
cost of capital hearing to set the ROE and capital structure.  If they don't
then there will be a lengthy rate hearing where many time consuming issues
such as higher depreciation will be debated.  If TCPL proceeds with this deal
in the face of litigants (from the LDCs perhaps) it is unclear which issues
will be raised  or how long the hearing will take.

TCPL is requesting by close of business Tuesday that we indicate whether we
will either
a. sign the agreement or
b. neither sign nor litigate or
c. litigate to NEB.

I understand from discussion earlier this week with Jon McKay and Rob
Milnthorp that Enron will choose Option B.  We can review on Tuesday.  If
anybody wants clarification on anything let me know.
