SUMMARY
On November 22, 2000, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission ("CTFC")approved four releases setting out final rules for
regulatory reform (the "Final Rules").  The Final Rules largely follow
the proposed rules issued by the Commission on June 8, 2000.*
The Final Rules are to be effective 60 days after their publication in
the Federal Register.
