Good Morning Jeff,
Catherine is out of the office until Tuesday 3/20/01.  Not wanting to keep
you waiting for a reply, I thought it best to give you some feedback
immediately.
The great majority of CAD's customers in CA are core.  CAD does not knowingly
terminate any current customer prior to their expiration date. The reasons
why CAD's customers are turned back to the utility are as follows:
1) Upon receiving renewal pricing from the CAD rep,  the customer chooses to
return to the utility.
2) Understanding that the current minimum margin per meter for our customers
is approximately $300, those customers that have extremely low annual volumes
are sent attrition letters and turned back to the LDC, at the end of their
contract.  We cannot competitively price this type of customer versus the
utility, and extract enough margin to support them. Currently in the
California markets (PG&E, SDG&E, & SOCAL) , there exists approximately 50
customers that have usages so low that given current market conditions, we
will not choose to renew the contracts.  The expiration dates for these are
between 5/30/2001 and 2/28/2005.
3) The customer initiates a request for termination prior to the end of their
contractual expiration date.  As we are all aware, California customers,
specifically those with either an index or NYMEX product, experienced a large
swing in their pricing during the past few months.  CAD has been inundated
with customers requesting to be returned to their LDC.  Although we seek to
satisfy our customer to the best of our ability,  returning these customers
to the utility is the LAST thing we want to do!!!!!!!
The steps we have taken to address this issue is to:
a) work with customer service/credit to offer extended payment options to
ease the effect of the increase.
b) offer to restructure the customer's contract, and reprice the customer on
a fixed price product; minimizing their risk going forward.
c) explain to the customer, in more detail, the reasons why this has
occurred, and how, going forward, the index/NYMEX pricing has eased.
Should you have additional questions, please reply or call.
