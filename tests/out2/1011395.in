This is to announce the publication of the ERCOT
Market Guide. The guide is a comprehensive
introduction to the competitive electric market
from a non-technical viewpoint. It is designed for
a general audience within your organization to
introduce the general concepts of the deregulated
market, the market participant and their roles,
and the rules of the competitive wholesale and
retail electric market. It is our hope that this
document will assist you in communicating basic
market concepts to the team of people working on
the successful launch of your efforts to
participate in the ERCOT market. The document is
also available for download at the ERCOT program
website. The document will be revised periodically
to incorporate any changes to market rules and
processes and any comments received. Subsequent
revisions will be posted to the program website.
