Eliz -- I need your group to put together a search which captures the
comments of PG&E and Edison officials in trade press, anlyst reports, and
speeches which would be inconsistent with the idea that they can now recover
their shortfall.  In other words, when they were trying to get AB 1890
passed, when they were fighting Proposition 9, when they floated their "rate
reduction bonds" and when they talked to analysts and rating agencies I'm
sure they assumed that they would live under the rate freeze and take the
risk of stranded cost recovery whithin the statutory deadline.
