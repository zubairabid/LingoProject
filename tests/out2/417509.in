Tana:
The following CPs are NOT authorized to trade US power:
Parallel Petroleum Corp. - restricted by credit
Terra International, Inc. - restricted by credit
Utilities Commission City of New Smyrna Beach - we have a contractual
relationship with the City of New Smyrna but not w/the Utilties Commission.
Let me     know if this CP objects to their restriction for US power, and
I'll talk to them.
