Recent information indicates that the State of Michigan and possibly other
state and industrial parties who have challenged the EPA's NOx SIP Call
regulation in court -- and lost -- will file an appeal with the U.S. Supreme
Court this September.

As you may recall, on June 22, the U.S. Court of Appeals, D.C. Circuit,
upheld the EPA's NOx SIP Call regulations, lifted the stay on the
regulations, and mandated that states move forward with developing and
submitting State Implementation Plans (SIPs) by the end of October 2000.

States that must now develop SIPs include:  Alabama, Connecticut, Delaware,
District of Columbia, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, West
Virginia, Wisconsin  (Georgia, Missouri & Wisconsin were excluded from the
regulation by the Appeals Court in its original decision, but will eventually
be re-included in the SIP process)

Impact of a Supreme Court Appeal:

Parties appealing the case to the Supreme Court will likely ask for a stay of
the EPA requirement for states to submit SIPs until the case is finally
decided.    It is not certain whether or not a stay would be granted by the
Court.  An appeal can not be filed until the Court returns at the beginning
of October, and a decision on a stay might not come until after the October
30 SIP deadline, so it many states might proceed with developing their SIP
anyway.   States who choose to not develop a SIP and assume that a stay will
be granted will be taking the risk that they miss the October 30 SIP deadline
and EPA imposes its own Federal Implementation Plan (FIP) -- if the stay is
not granted, the state would have to live with the federal requirements for
NOx reductions in its state.

Another impact is that the May 2003 deadline for implementation of the rule
-- and compliance by emitting sources -- may also be delayed if the Supreme
Court imposes a stay on the regulations and accepts the case on appeal.   If
the case is accepted, a decision would not likely be reached until June 2001,
which would likely delay a compliance deadline until 2004.

We will keep you posted as this situation develops.  Right now, Environmental
Strategies is continuing to work in the states that are developing SIPs, to
ensure that the states treat new generation fairly and that market-based
solutions to NOx reduction are employed so that trading and other
opportunities for Enron businesses will be maximized.
