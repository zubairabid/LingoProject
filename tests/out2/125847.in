Chuck, The price obtained as the average of the closing price for the last
three trading days for the month plus $0.34 is to be the price for the next
month.  We need to give them a credit for the volumes that we purchase back
due to their volume defaults in the month.  Our buyback price  is to be Gas
Daily midpoint less $0.15 for the shortfall in volumes.  The $0.15 is the
penalty for the default and the Gas Daily Midpoint price is what we purchase
the shortfall back for; but remember if the Gas Daily Midpoint is higher that
the Nx3, we use the Nx3 as the buyback price for the shortfall.  I know that
you will not have  all of the information at the time you send them the
invoice for the next month's prepayment, so you need to keep a schedule and
trueup each month for the prior months activity.
John and Patrice, Do you agree with the foregoing?
