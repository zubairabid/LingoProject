Thanks for your comments on the standards.  Our approach in creating a global
exception reporting mechanism is to start simply and build from there.  Our
initial cut is to have effective exception reporting on a handful of critical
standards by the end of this year.  That will be a first, to on a daily basis
have a view into the exceptions outside the global  standards.  Many of the
measurements that you mention are great management tools for accessing the
level of excellence of the services that we are delivering and the competence
of those that are managing these services.  Some of these may be more
appropriately contained in a monthly operations report that I have instituted
within ENA and which we are working to proliferate across all of the
wholesale merchant services companies.  Give me a call and we can set a time
to get together for a few minutes and I can review this operating report with
you.

We spent some time at our offsite in late October with all operations
controllers reviewing and discussing these standards.  Shona has taken a stab
at the format of these exception reports.  It is likely that we will have a
rep from each of the operating companies participate in the final design of
these reports, so that all feel as if they own the intended output from these
reports.

Yes, we are gleaning this information from those that are responsible for
these activities.  My purpose is not to use this info to punish or prosecute,
but instead to use this exception report as a tool to garner resources as
needed to clear the exceptions.  It is invariably the deals that are
exceptions in some way that create the problems.  For instance, small power
deals that were done in Calgary before they had a power book set up.  These
were "on the side" and not captured in total power exposure because they
didn't have a book to put them in (a discovery during the doorstep review).
If this goes on the exception report, then we can highjack someone in risk in
Houston to help Calgary set up a new book, or get IT resources focused
quickly on any solution that may require their input to fix.  By having a
prescribed elevation of these exceptions, we should get the appropriate
attention to correct them.  The spur for making sure that all exceptions are
appropriately noted, will be that if there is a problem with any deal that
was an exception (not in the books, no confirm, etc.) and was not included on
the exception report, that this will be grounds for termination for the
appropriate operations controller.  I will make sure that as we start this
reporting process that this is well understood.  The other impetus will be
that during doorstep reviews the operational activities will be gauged
against these standards.  The AA internal audits should also access adherence
to these.
