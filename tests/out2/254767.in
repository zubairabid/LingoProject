Thanks for the update, Walt.  One option we were considering was a "share the
pain" settlement with Dreyfus, whereby they would let us buy out of the
remaining position at a steep discount (to acknowledge their contributory
negligence in this matter).  Has there been any additional headway in this
area?  I'm on vacation and haven't heard anything on this.  Weren't we going
to send a V&E litigator to visit Dreyfus' general counsel? If we commence
legal proceedings against Dreyfus, things will become costly and contentious
between us. Information will come slowly and grudgingly.  We have copies of
some of their internal notes which indicate that they knew---or should have
known---that something wasn't quite right with Todoroff's situation.  Before
we start filing discovery motions, we should exhaust the possibility of
meeting with their general counsel to see if a quick "business" settlement
can be obtained.  Please advise. Thanks.  SWD
