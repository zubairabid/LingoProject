Gas Turbines Headed for a 50% Meltdown

High natural gas prices, performance issues and higher than expected
maintenance costs, a general economic slowdown and several other key factors
will combine to create a "near-term meltdown in the gas turbine market,"
according to a report by WEFA, Inc.

Reporting on a study about to be published by the analysis and consulting
firm based in Eddystone, PA, one of its authors predicted "a substantial
short-term correction in the gas turbine market..which could render 50% of
current North American projects uneconomic." Jason Makansi, principal of
Makansi & Co., pointed to other factors, such as the inexperience of many
generating companies with the hedging and trading skills necessary to
optimize profits in the peaking market, the rise of "stealth capacity" from
refitted or otherwise optimized coal and nuclear plants, "gas transportation
bottlenecks and persistent issues with safety and explosions," and "a
protracted quasi-regulatory quagmire."

Under the heading of stealth capacity, "old assets are being purchased or
merged into new electric economy organizations that will improve capacity
factors at coal-fired plants from the typical 60-65% to perhaps 80-85% within
five years." A major part of the gain will come simply from operating the
assets to serve the market and not just a single service territory, Makansi
said. He reported on the soon-to-be released study at WEFA's World Economic
Conference last week in New York.

The nuclear industry is experiencing a similar transformation. Several years
ago predictions were that as much as one-third of nuclear plants would soon
be retired. Today, with many units sold to new owners and re-licensed, it
appears the retirement rate will be more like 5-10% and productivity for the
remaining units will be increased.

The WEFA report points to a "technological correction" for the advanced
technology "F-Class" turbines going into most new plants today, as unexpected
problems crop up with extended use. There are a host of problems in the
technology area, which can be met, but at a cost: the new units may not meet
emissions targets without impacting efficiency, heat rate and durability;
fuel-switching is not living up to its advance billing; units may not perform
as well at high ambient temperatures; overhauls are required more frequently
than had been expected; maintenance costs also are exceeding expectations;
and fuel quality is becoming an issue.

"Variable O&M costs at some projects with F-class machines are running as
high as $25,000 to $30,000 per start. Considering that some of these machines
may exhibit several hundred starts in a year, you have a variation of that
worn phrase, "a start here, a start there, pretty soon you're talking about
real money!"

"The bottom line of all this is that many of the claimed performance
advantages of the gas turbine have been lost or severely eroded." Makansi
also pointed to similar experiences with gas turbines in the U.K., Asia,
Australia, and Chile. He predicted a turbine market correction "and an
unavoidable plateau to work out technological kinks, modify designs and
inject reality into business models. We believe all this will push
consolidation in the generation sector of the electricity industry even
faster." Makansi predicted about half a dozen major players will control 50%
of the generation capacity in the U.S. within five to 10 years.
