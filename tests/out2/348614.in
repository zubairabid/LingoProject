Cynthia:  here is the comment I would forward to Senators Gramm and Schumer
concerning their provision on "Environmental Conditionality".

Sorry this was thrown together very quickly on short notice, but I hope it is
helpful.


Section 154:  Environmental Conditionality

In general, as this provision attempts to close the loophole for
grandfathered (pre 1977) coal plants, there would be an negative impact on
coal trading (particularly high-sulfur) and our equity positions in coal
mines.  However, there are opportunities to still profit by shorting/hedging
our positions -- if we have enough knowledge and information about when these
changes are going to take place, we will likely be able to seize
opportunities from the resulting volatility.

The question in your e-mail asked only about coal markets, but on the whole,
Enron could find some benefits from this kind of provision because of our
ability to trade more gas, transport more gas, and build merchant
gas/combined cycle capacity, renewables, etc.  I have not had the chance to
get any analysis on electricity prices, but I would suspect that our view
would be that there may be some volatility due to the shift in fuels but it
would level out with the right risk management in the longer term -- I can
try to get more for you as this legislation evolves.

Specific comments on the drafting, section-by-section:

(a)  the only comment I would raise is that how the term "electric generating
unit (EGU)" is defined is controversial right now.  The EPA wants to make
sure EGU includes industrial boilers -- this point is being litigated in the
NOx SIP Call and Section 126 cases right now.   Unless it was the intent to
also capture industrial coal boilers in this Section, it may be wise to
clarify that you are targeting utilities.   Industrials will raise a great
deal of opposition if this provision is construed to include them.

(b)  It probably does not make a great deal of difference whether you are
taking the average capacity factor for "coal fired" vs. "fossil" -- averaging
all fossil units will create an average capacity factor that makes it a
little harder for coal to meet environmental performance standards.   I
believe the 1990-1999 average capacity factor for all fossil/coal plants
would be around 65%.  Large, heavily-loaded coal plants are probably in the
70-80% range, so they would have to cut back substantially.   However, some
of the older interim load coal plants may only run at about 65% or less, in
which case they may still emit a substantial amount of pollution but not be
captured under this provision.   So in effect, this section may not limit all
grandfathered coal plants, just the big ones.

(c)  I don't know if this is a drafting oversight, or an attempt to set the
bar unreasonably high for coal, but including the word ALL in the phrase
"average emission performance achieved by ALL electric generating units"
would mean including gas and other clean sources in looking at emissions
averages -- which no coal unit could ever meet.   In the name of workability,
hopefully they will include something like "achieved by all COAL FIRED
electric generating units"
