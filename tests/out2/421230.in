Samantha,

A Counterparty has traded two deals on EOL in which their Trader was logged
in as the wrong entity.  Correct Counterparty is TransCanada Energy Financial
Products Limited.  The entity they traded under (and are not allowed to do
Financial deals under) is TransCanada Energy Marketing USA, Inc.  Can you
have someone create an Assignment Agreement to move these to the correct
entity?  The deal numbers are QF1574.1 (EOL #668266), and QF2534.1 (EOL
#670690), both traded on December 7, 2000.  Enron entity is Enron Canada Corp.

Thanks,
Joe
