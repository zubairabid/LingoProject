Attached is an e-mail that I sent to my management earlier this week.

A also have a couple of questions and observations.  First, do we have
anything in writing from PG&E when they refused to comply with our request to
revise their Roll-off Matrix?

Also, I spoke with Jeff who informed me of the various variables that the
market has to work with to negotiate with PG&E.  I agree with the following
variables:
extend the rate freeze beyond 2001, but no later than the end of 2004.
a $3.5 to $4.0 billion hydro valuation on January 1, 2002 to cover TRA and
TCBA undercollections at that point in time, with future payments based on a
revenue requirement calculation and a fixed rate of return.  These fixed
payments will be offset by the wholesale market revenues for the hydro
output.  Ratepayers will have to make up the difference in the future through
a balancing account and fixed surcharge or surcredit; in financial derivative
terms this is is the equivalent of a negative index (fixed revenue
requirement - market revenues presumed to be the PX).  This essentially NPVs
the cashflows to payoff shortfalls today at the risk of creating shortfalls
in the future to the extent that the value is too high.
increase the level of the frozen rate at some modest amount.  Keep in mind, a
$10 per mWh increase in PG&E's rates beginning January 1, 2001, translates to
a $155 million hit to the book for 2001 through 2010, so we would need an
offsetting benefit.  We could probably offset this hit if the rate freeze was
extended through March 31, 2002.
allow PG&E to hedge procurement costs for the extended frozen time period.
it is critical that the rate freeze does not end before July 1, 2001 for all
customers, including large and small and DA and SO.  Preferably the rate
freeze would end no earlier than December 31, 2001 or 2002.  They can also
extend the rate freeze for a longer period of time for small customers or
change the freeze to an SDG&E type of mechanism beyond December 31, 2001.
The following is PG&E's situtation.

As you can see that they will be trying to cut their losses, even though they
have still not fully collected all outstanding undercollections.
Undercollections are projected to grow through next year.  What PG&E will be
looking for is a way out or a swaption to switch customers from the fixed to
index asap.  I don't think they will be so quick to do give up $500 million
at this point and will be interested in some type of settlement that would
protect this amount.  There is still the political hot potato about rolling
off early and selling out customers and the only way they could do this is
with a quick valuation of hydro.  Maybe they would be willing to take some
loss even in a settlement to avoid upsetting politicians and customers.  If
the process is delayed, PG&E's exposure will probably be over $1 billion by
the end of the year and possible $2 billion by the end of 2001.  So you see,
there would be a need for some combination of a slight increase in rates,
extension of the freeze to capture the backwardation in commodity price, and
a higher hydro valuation with ratepayers incurring the risk for the higher
valuation in the future, in exchange for a deal that insulates ratepayers
from volatility and rate shock today.
It is key that the extended Rate Freeze equitably treats DA customers in the
form of today's rate freeze with a PX credit that is not capped.
