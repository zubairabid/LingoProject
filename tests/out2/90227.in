Enron Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS) has entered into an agreement to
utilize United Parcel Service (UPS) as Enron,s preferred carrier for package
delivery.  Through the new agreement, GSS has been able to leverage existing
package delivery spend from all Enron business units worldwide in order to
achieve more aggressive pricing discounts.  Effective immediately, all Enron
business units will be able to realize savings by utilizing the new agreement.

In the next couple weeks, GSS will be distributing more detailed information
regarding additional shipping options, training schedules and package
tracking capabilities available from your desktop. In the meantime, employees
and/or locations who currently utilize &Package and Ship Requests8 may
continue to do so.  Please provide all required information, including RC and
Company Number and identify UPS as the requested carrier.  Other office
locations should continue using their existing procedures, utilizing UPS
whenever possible, to obtain the discounted pricing.

If you have questions or comments about the new agreement, please contact
Randy Lagrimini, GSS contract manager at 713-646-7366 or Verna Molandes, UPS
preferred customer associate at 281-847-6769 or 1-800-432-2877.
