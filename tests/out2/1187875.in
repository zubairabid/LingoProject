One more update:
I tried to change the departure date, but the flights are all sold out on
Saturday and Sunday (they would have changed them free of charge).  I have
included a map of the area and the Airline has told me that they are
planning now on resuming flights to St Thomas as of 9pm tonight.  They also
just told me that since we are pre-confirmed customers on the San Juan to St
Thomas we will not get bumped off the flight to accommodate previously
cancelled customers - especially in the middle of an active trip.  That is
good news.
Looks full steam ahead.  Bruce - just a tactical question for you - do you
want to move to St John on Saturday if there are not a lot of penalties to
do so?  Could be fun to see the other island.
