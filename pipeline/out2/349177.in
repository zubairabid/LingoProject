Steve, thanks for the helpful materials. However, if the experience in
overseas deregulating electricity markets where price increases and spikes
have occurred is any precedent, we will need to have some more down-to-earth
responses to a some of the potentially inflammatory issues facing the
politicians:
1. When the prices spike, who reaps the windfall? Who sells that most
expensive 1% of the kwh? Is it a careful planner or a lucky speculator or
market manipulator? Someone is making a bunch of money off the screwed up
system. Who is it, and why is that OK?
2. We do not allow people to inflate water prices to consumers in times
of drought, or food prices in times of hurricanes or floods. Even gasoline
price increases in periods of high demand are within 20%-30% of the base, not
2,5,10 or 100 times the average like spot electric prices. The issue isn't
whether the system is broken or not or how bad partial regulation is or how
much demand has increased versus supply. Thes will be seen as "ivory tower"
discussions. The populist political issue is, until the problem is fixed, why
should some shrewd big electric company or middleman be allowed to profit off
the misfortune of consumers who did not cause the problem? Why should anyone
be allowed to profiteer by selling at multiples above their generation cost?
3. The hedges, fixed price contracts and other de facto insurance against
volatility that Enron or others offer could be seen as a symptom of the
problem rather than the solution.  Enron could be seen as at best a band aid
and at worst an opportunist made possible only by a broken system - - -sort
of like the guys who ran the old style protection rackets, or Colombian
"security consultants" who "guard " pipelines from the threats their guerilla
afiliates create, or  political risk insurance that you shouldn't really need
if the host country wasn't so screwed up. Don't worry about high crime in
your neighborhood -  - - just hire an off-duty policeman.   Who needed these
new electricity risk management products in the old days before deregulation?
We have to be able to answer these types of questions at the level of the
ordinary citizen, not merely have the correct long-term competitive market
solution, or the forces of ignorance and re-regulation will gain momentum.
Are we sure we shouldn't back a temporary peak hour price cap  until the
regulatory problems we're all familiar with are worked out, to avoid a much
worse long term rollback?. - - -DLH
