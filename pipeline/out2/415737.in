I hope you all had a wonderful and Joyous Easter!  I have now spoken with the
Lloyds and the Kennedies who have confirmed their May 13 Church Gourmet party
lists and are getting recipes distributed.  I have not heard from any of you
and hope that your planning is going well.  If you need assistance or have
any questions, please call me soon.  Otherwise, please confirm that you have
successfully called your guests as soon as you can so we can get a good head
count and balance the parties as necessary.
Thanks
