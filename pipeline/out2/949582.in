Vince,

Just to let you know, the books will be shipped to both you and Rice
University tomorrow by express mail, which means the books should arrive
within  5 days (depending on customs).

Rice has purchased 25 books, and I informed them that if they don't sell
them all, we willcredit their accountwith the amount of unsold  copies.
I've asked them togive youany extra copies instead of  returning them.

Please find attached the invoice for the 50 books.

Thanks again, and if you need anything further, please let me know.

Julie
