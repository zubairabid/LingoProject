Dr. Kaminski, I would like to thank you very much for taking care of Amy and
me
during our trip to Houston. What I saw at Enron Communication was nothing
short
of revolutionary. More than that, I was impressed with the drive of the
people,
their kindness, and their proficiency. I look forward to meeting you again in
Stanford during the last weekend of February. I will send you an email next
week, so that we can arrange a meeting between you and Prof. Bambos.
All the best wishes,

Giuseppe
