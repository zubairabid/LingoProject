I met with Dennis Benevides, Jim Wood and Scott Gahn about the PG&E strategy
we discussed and the EES perspective.  Suggestions:

Endorse the recent CAL ISO report on causes of the problem (no utility
forward buying, no demand responsiveness, etc) and say, with a few tweaks,
their proposals were on target.

Get CTC roll-off no earlier than Spring '01.  Retroactive roll-off would be
devastating.

Use PG&E $15 billion exposure as leverage to get competitive default supplier
in place (get them out of merchant supply).

Impose a stair-step shape on the rate increase, to prompt customer migration.

Keep PG&E somewhat at risk for wholesale cost recovery, delay recovery of
under-recoveries until out years.

Keep rate freeze (which is preferable to rate cap) to as short a period as
possible, post '01.

Here is a rework of Jim's bullet points to incorporate these thoughts:
Keep in mind the numbers are all just placeholders and are not meant to be
definitive.  Once we start to hone in on the concept, we can develop the
right numbers.

From a retail perspective, this blends protection of the book with
advancement of new market opportunity.  I may still get more feedback from
the EES guys, but wanted to give you what I got so far.
