Dear Mark and Liz::

I'm going to be in NYC for a mid-day meeting on 12/14  and was hoping to meet
later with someone at ISDA to discuss how they operate.  I know you are both
active in ISDA and was hoping you could help me set up a meeting with the
right person(s).  Please let me know if you can help.

The reason for the request is that  I am in the information gathering stage
of developing a business plan to establish a membership organization to
manage the EEI contract  process.  Once my plan is fleshed out, I would like
to come down to Houston and make a presentation to the participating members
of the EEI-NEM contract group to get their reaction.

Regards,
