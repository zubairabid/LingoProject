Dale/Bart/Sara,
We need to clean up the confirmation and any other legal information that
accompanies it (Bart/Sara, is the attached Omnibus T&Cs we proposed to use
standard documentation or are any revisions necessary prior to sending out to
CCSI?) so that we can send this out to CCSI for their review.
Looking at the confirmation, I see the following items that need to be
revised:
Trade date/Signing date - Not yet confirmed; will insert date the deal is
closed when it is known.
Need to specify which curve to look at in the Gas Daily Index (there is a low
high and a mid or average); we did not specify which one we would refer to
previously
Do we need to replace ECT with ENA throughout??
Catalytica should be Catalytica Combustion Systems (the subsidiary not the
parent)
Need to add in details about CCSI (name/title/payment account info etc.)
Sean - I will get the info for 5 from CCSI
Dale - Could you correct number 2, advise on number 3 and review the document
again to see if any other information is lacking that should be included?
Bart/Sara  - Could you advise about the details on the Omnibus (I have
misplaced any copy of this)  I thought there were some credit issues that
needed to be filled in at the bottom of this?
If anyone else could advise on other items that need to be addressed with
either the Confirmation and/or the Omnibus agreement, now is the time!
Regards,
