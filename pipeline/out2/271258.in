Attached is an email from Rogelio Lopez Velarde summarizing the current
status of the Amparo proceeding related to the Vitro project.  The attached
analysis clearly differs from the information provided by the Lopez Velarde
firm at the end of December when they indicated the Amparo proceeding should
be dismissed by the end of January.

As I believe you are aware, the dismissal with prejudice of the Amparo
proceeding is a condition precedent to first disubursement under the Vitro
Loan Agreement.  Although there are still many other conditions that must be
satisfied before first disbursement can occur, we do not anticipate that six
weeks will pass before such conditions have been satisfied.

Therefore, I contacted the inhouse attorney for the lender, the
Inter-American Development Bank, to discuss the status of the Amparo
proceeding with him.  At my urging, he has agreed that the Inter-American
Development Bank will waive the dismissal of the Amparo proceeding as a
condition to first disbursement and will, instead, require that the
proceeding be dismissed prior to second disbursement.  I have been informed
that second disbursement will not occur until at least a month subsequent to
first disbursement.  In such case, it is anticipated that the waiver of this
condition to first disbursement will provide sufficient time for the docket
to be cleared and for the Amparo proceeding to be dismissed prior to second
disbursement.

The project company will be required to request in writing that the
Inter-American Development Bank waive this condition precedent and such
written request will be prepared after a review to determine whether other
waivers may be requested but in sufficient time for the Inter-American
Development Bank to process the request through their internal channels prior
to the date of first disbursement.

Should you have any questions or comments, please do not hesitate to contact
me.
