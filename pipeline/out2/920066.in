Hey there -- Life sounds horribly busy.  I figured it was.
Don't worry about me -- I just thought we should get things moving -- since
now I have officially been replaced, and it has been announced to my direct
reports here in London.   Fernley (not sure if you have spoken to him)  is
anxious to put an announcement out to Enron Europe that Phillip Lord and I
are leaving and that Melissa will be stepping in to replace us.
Since Phillip already has a place to go, it would be nice if we could at
least say that I am going to North America Energy Ops, or something -- even
if we don't have all of the details worked out.
I am not sure if you want me to come over and meet some of your commercial "
customers"  --- also  - I have never met Delainey (I don't think)  -- but
maybe knowing Frevert well is enough.  I am planning to come in November
(first half) to work on Europe's plan and coordinate with Brent, Wes and the
other groups under Frevert, so maybe I can meet some people then.  Would love
to discuss
Monday is fine -- as I am sure today will be another crazy day.
I know how all of those reviews are.  John Sherriff put a o5 per review per
day penalty on any dept head who didn't have their reviews  done by August
15th, and of course I was on holiday the week before that, so I had 2 days to
do 10 reviews.
Hopefully I can help you with that direct report problem.
If I don't talk to you today, then have a good weekend,
