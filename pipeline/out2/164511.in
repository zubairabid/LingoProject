Two things:
1. I called Smutney last week re this press conference and declined.  I said
that the idea is fine and we support it, but Enron does not want to
participate in a press conference with other generators on this topic.
2. I just talked to Rob Lamkin of Southern who indicated that ten companies
have gotten letters from Gov Davis addressed to "Dear CEO of Energy
Company."  Letter was to invite these companies to attend a meeting on
Monday, December 1 in LA.  Agenda and issues to follow, but Rob thought it
had to do with the Gov's plan for CA due 12/1.  Meeting will not be with
Davis, but with his staff.  Southern is deciding who to send.  Reliant will
send John Stout and Curtis Keebler.  Williams got a letter, but no info re
their rep.  Rob was calling to see if we got a letter and, if we did, out
thoughts re meeting before the Gov's meeting to discuss.  I said we could
have gotten a letter, but I did not know.
