very high expectations for 2001.  In order to better focus and expand the
various businesses within Global Markets, we are pleased to announce the

This new group under the leadership of Dan Reck is developing a business in
the inter-modal transportation area in the United States.  Shawn Cumberland
has joined this group to lead and expand the origination opportunities in
this business.  Shawn,s most recent assignment was as COO of the CALME region.

Global Risk Management
Jere Overdyke has elected to leave Enron after almost 10 years of service.
Per Sekse will take over the leadership of this very exciting and growing
business.  Per is located in Enron,s New York office but will be spending a
significant amount of his time in Houston.

We look forward to this year and feel the above changes will provide the
