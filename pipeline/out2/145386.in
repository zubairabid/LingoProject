Enron and Andersen Consulting are proud to sponsor the 2nd Annual
Aggie-Longhorn
Flag Football Challenge on Saturday, November 18.  The purpose of this event
is to
raise money for both schools, and to enjoy the competitive spirit of the
third oldest rivalry
in college football.  This year's game marks the 107th meeting between Texas
A&M
University and The University of Texas, and, with a little luck, the Big 12
South Title
will be on the line!

Enron and Andersen Consulting are sponsoring the event, but we need your help
as
participants and fundraisers.  Contributions raised will benefit the general
scholarship fund
for each school.

Prizes:    Winning team receives 16 tickets to the A&M/UT game in
Austin on Friday, November 24
Winning team also owns the "Horns Down/Horns Up" trophy
until next year!

Fundraising Goal  The committee has set a goal of raising $16,000 for each
school.  This will require a contribution of $2,000 per team,
plus an equal amount from corporate matching funds.

Last year's event featured a last-minute comeback as the Enron Aggies Team 1
defeated the Enron
Longhorns Team 1 for the championship and took home the tickets and the
trophy.  This year, expect
the Longhorns (and Andersen Consulting) to come in with revenge on their
minds!

Thanks to the gracious gift from the UT Alumni, who redirected their
donations to the A&M Foundation,
we were able to permanently endow scholarships dedicated to the memory of the
12 Aggies who died
in last year's Bonfire collapse.  We believe this event is a great tradition
for both companies, and we are
pleased to be able to raise important funds for both institutions.

If you are interested in participating or otherwise being involved, you must
contact one of the team captains
below by the close of business on Friday, November 3 (phone or email).  Team
rosters will be filled on a
first-come, first-served basis.
