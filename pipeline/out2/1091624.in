Debbie,
I spoke with Robin, and from what we know Canada officializes one calc that
includes both their price and basis positions.  (Calc is represented by the
orange)    However, Risktrac only recognizes the book id to which it assigns
the post id. (It appears that it is only the PRC book that comes through, the
BAS book is represented by the red "x", however it is in the same calc.).
Since the Canadian post id only includes two books ids,  the Benchmark group
manually assign the same post id to the basis book, that way both books get
picked up.

Does this help?
