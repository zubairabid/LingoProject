PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL:  ATTORNEY-CLIENT COMMUNICATION, ATTORNEY WORK

Matt:
I agree w/ Britt that we need to know more about what testing has been done,
but I would think that the joint test should be conducted using the same
method used at loadport (regardless of whether ashing is proper or not).  Not
for the reason you mention (Mitsubishi may well argue about "proper"
rejection, but that's not likely a viable argument, since the fact is that
First Gas rejected the cargo and the dirt spec alone was sufficient grounds
for that rejection), but for the sake of consistency.  It doesn't matter at
all to First Gas what test methods were used or will be used on this cargo --
it's no longer any of their concern.  It's Enron's risk and sole
responsibility to deal w/ costs following rejection -- per the contract.  I
hope that we are not informing First Gas about anything that has happened or
will happen on this cargo (I noticed a note from Jon Russell inquiring about
the cargo -- I trust that we have politely refused to tell them anything).
Regards,
Janice
