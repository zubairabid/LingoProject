Chris this is capacity we got from NIMO as part of a peaking deal with them,
they can call on gas delivered to their gate,they reimburse for all cost at a
north point gas daily price plus 100% transport.  We in essance can sell the
capacity off on a monthly basis (sell it delivered)  NIMO would not allow us
to
use this as part of our transport to our enduses though, we also have capacity
for that.
