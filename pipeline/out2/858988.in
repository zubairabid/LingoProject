Longhorn Q & A
Q: Can you give us the history behind the Hex Rally? And also, when is it
this year?
Margot Linney

BROWN:  According to the Texas sports information office, the Hex Rally will
be held Monday, Nov. 20, at 9 p.m. on the university's main mall in front of
the UT Tower. For years, the Texas-Texas A game featured bonfires at both
schools. But the environmentalists won out in Austin, causing the end to the
bonfire for UT students. In place of the traditional bonfire, Texas turned
instead to an old story to start a new tradition. In 1941, Texas had not
beaten Texas Aat Kyle Field since 1923. A group of students turned to an
Austin fortune teller named Mrs. August Hipple, who gave them the
prescription for victory. "Burn red candles," she said. The burning of the
candles, she thought, would show the great support for the team. Texas won,
23-0, and the red candle legend was born. The candle burning lay dormant
until 1950, when Texas brought out the candles again the week of the SMU
game, and the Longhorns upset No. 1 SMU, 23-20. It was back in the boxes for
the candles after that until 1953, when Texas hosted a Baylor team that was
unbeaten and seeking its first-ever SWC title. Texas blocked an extra point
after the first score and won, 21-20. "The red candles are the most potent
whammy in Texas tradition and are nothing to be lightly invoked," wrote Time
magazine after the upset. In 1963, Texas was driving for its first unbeaten
season in modern history, and the possibility of a national championship as
it hosted Baylor. For three of the previous four years, UT had been in the
same position - on the verge of a perfect year - only to be upset. Out came
the red candles one more time, and UT won, 7-0. Bonfires ended in Austin in
the late 1970s and seeking a new tradition, the "hex rallies" were started in
1986.

Chris Simms

Q: So far this season, Chris Simms has thrown five interceptions that were
returned for touchdowns (if you count the return on the failed two-point
conversion attempt last week in Kansas). Can you help explain what Chris is
doing that makes him so vulnerable to this problem? Also, has Chris set a
school record in this statistic? I enjoy the newsletter.
Jeff Cookston

BROWN:  Chris Simms has had trouble looking off the defense by locking onto
his intended receiver too early in his drop back. He will look away from his
intended receiver

but only for a split second. He needs to look off the defense better, and he
also admits that he must stop trying to force balls into tight coverage. He
suffers from the same thing that plagued Brett Favre. He sees a receiver in
double or triple coverage and thinks he has the strength to thread a needle.
Simms said he saw the double coverage on the pass that was picked off and
returned for a TD against Kansas. He said he should have thrown it away. He
said he's learning. He also said that his confidence since coming to Texas is
at an all-time high. So that's good news for the Longhorns if Simms ends up
getting the start against Texas A&M.



Q: I have heard that next year's schedule is just about as weak as this
year's. Can you either give it to us, or let us know where on the Web to find
it.
Steve Davis

BROWN:  The 2001 schedule is as follows: Sept. 1, New Mexico State; Sept. 8,
North Carolina; Sept. 22, at Houston; Sept. 29, Texas Tech; Oct. 6, Oklahoma
(in Dallas); Oct. 13, at Oklahoma State; Oct. 20, Colorado; Oct. 27, at
Missouri; Nov. 3, at Baylor; Nov. 10, Kansas; and Nov. 23 or 24, at Texas
A&M.



Q: Mack Brown was criticized in the early season for the QB shuffle. To his
credit, he maintained that two QBs were better than one. At this stage and
based on Chris Simms' recent games, it would seem to me that Brown was
correct and did a masterful job of keeping everyone happy with winning five
games in a row. Also, Brown was able to keep both Major Applewhite and Simms
motivated. What do you think?
Charley Davis, Southlake, Texas

BROWN:  I think the rotation is now paying off. But I still stand by my
belief that the rotation slowed down the progress of the offense early in the
year. Mack Brown said the rotation didn't work as well as it could have
because this year's team lacked senior leadership. At North Carolina, Brown
said his QB rotations worked because his teams were older. Anyway, there's no
doubt that Chris Simms is better off for having played early in the year. And
Simms is definitely still happy at Texas. No chance of him transferring.



Q: Can you update us on UT's injuries?
Ken

BROWN:  As of right now, Major Applewhite's right knee sprain is keeping him
out of practice this week, and he is questionable for the Agame. SS Lee
Jackson (hamstring) is probable. TE Brock Edwards (leg) and WR Artie Ellis
(shin) are questionable. DT Stevie Lee (foot) is out and will seek a medical
redshirt for this season, a move that would give him four years of
eligibility remaining.

Q: I'd like an update on recruiting, our commitments, our prospects and how
you think we will finish.
Matt Dunnahoo

BROWN:  Texas has 19 oral commitments with roughly six or seven scholarships
remaining. There are 10 recruits left who have either been offered a
scholarship or who are strongly considering Texas. They are: DT Tommie Harris
of Killeen Ellison; LB Derrick Johnson of Waco; DL Kaelen Jakes of Valencia,
Calif.; TE James Moses and DE Jonathan Jackson, both of Galena Park North
Shore; OL Jamie Hightower of

Jacksonville; OL William Winston of Houston Madison; S Dwayne Brandon of
Temple; athlete Quan Cosby of Mart; and DT Paul Brossard of Blinn JC.
Johnson, Jakes, Moses, Jackson and Brandon are strong Texas leans at this
point. Most of those players will visit Texas on the weekend of Dec. 15-17,
the same weekend as the UT football banquet. Texas' 19 oral commitments are
from the following student-athletes: OL Jonathan Scott (6-7, 290, 4.9) of
Dallas Carter; OL Abe Robinson (6-6, 270, 4.9), Jersey Village; OL Alfio
Randall (6-6, 300, 5.1), Blinn JC; OL Mike Garcia (6-5, 280, 5.2), Galena
Park; OL Will Allen (6-5, 300, 5.2), Cypress Falls; OL Roman Reeves (6-6,
295, 5.2), Livingston; OL Terrance Young (6-6, 340, 5.5), Longview; QB Matt
Nordgren (6-5, 225, 4.6), Dallas Bishop Lynch; RB Cedric Benson (5-11, 200,
4.5), Midland Lee; Anthony Johnson (5-11, 195, 4.4), Jefferson; DE Eric Hall
(6-2, 240, 4.5), Clarksville, Tenn.; LB Yamil LeBron (6-2, 240, 4.7), Killeen
Ellison; LB Lance McFarland (6-1, 225, 4.6), Jefferson; DB Cedric Griffin
(6-1, 180, 4.4), San Antonio Holmes; DB Aaron Ross (6-1, 182, 4.42), Tyler;
DB Kendal Briles (5-10, 175, 4.5), Wolfforth Frenship; DB Braden Johnson
(6-2, 200, 4.5), Euless Trinity; DB Brian Carter (5-11, 180, 4.5), The
Woodlands; P Brian Bradford (6-1, 205), Trinity Valley JC.



Q: Which bowl do you see UT ending up in? I know that the second-place team
in the Big 12 goes to the Cotton Bowl. What place would Texas be if we
defeated A&M? I remember that when Abeat Kansas State a few years ago,
K-State ended up in the Alamo Bowl and UT played in the Cotton Bowl. Is there
a chance of a repeat of that if OU beats K-State in the Big 12 championship
game?
Mike Thakur

BROWN:  If Kansas State beats Oklahoma in the Big 12 title game, there's a
chance both teams will get into the BCS. Nebraska would then be the likely
choice for the Cotton Bowl, and the Texas-Texas Awinner would be the likely
choice for the Holiday Bowl, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. But
there are rumblings that Nebraska isn't excited about the Cotton Bowl and
would rather go to the Holiday Bowl. That could send the UT-Awinner to the
Cotton Bowl and the loser to either the Alamo Bowl or the Insight.com Bowl in
Phoenix, Ariz. If Oklahoma beats Kansas State, the Wildcats would have three
losses, including one to Texas A&M. That means the Wildcats would probably
drop to the Insight.com Bowl. And the winner of the UT-Agame would go to
either the Holiday or the Cotton, with the loser going to the Alamo Bowl. The
Holiday opponent would be either Oregon or Oregon State. The Alamo opponent
would likely be Michigan or Ohio State.



Q: Don't you think Texas has a huge advantage over my Fighting Texas Aggies
for the following reasons: 1) UT's playing at home; 2) Jason Glenn, Robert
Ferguson, and Sammy Davis, three of the Aggies' best players, are going to be
out for the game; and 3) A&M's coming off a demoralizing loss to Oklahoma in
the biggest game of the year on a national stage. It will be hard to recover
from that. It looks as if Texas has everything going for it. I believe if
Awould have beaten Oklahoma, there is not any way Texas beats Awhen the Big
12 south crown is on the line.
Justin S. Schwertner

BROWN:  I don't see the Aggies struggling to come back from the Oklahoma
loss. They played well enough that they probably gained some confidence from
that game. The bigger setbacks for the Aggies are the loss (or diminished
ability) of Glenn, Ferguson and Davis. Glenn, the team's sack leader and a
spirited leader at linebacker, is out for sure with a knee injury that will
require surgery. If Ferguson, one of the top receivers in the Big 12, and
Davis, a top cornerback for the Aggies, indeed cannot play, those are big
hurdles to overcome for A&M. Playing in Austin helps Texas. But this game
will probably come down to who runs the ball best. Look for this to be a
showdown between Ja'Mar Toombs and Hodges Mitchell.

Roy Williams

Q: I thought Roy Williams was good before the Kansas game, but he looked like
he might have played himself into some postseason awards against the
Jayhawks.
Steve Jansen

BROWN:  Williams caught four passes for 180 yards - all in the first half.
Imagine if UT had kept throwing to him in the second half. He did have a
35-yard reverse for a touchdown (in the second half) for his first rushing TD
as a Longhorn. But perhaps the

most amazing stats involving Williams right now are that his seven TD
receptions this season have averaged 47.6 yards. Five of those TD catches
came when Texas was behind or tied. The other two came when UT was holding
narrow three-point and seven-point leads and provided oomph on the way to
victories. He may end up on some All-Big 12 second teams because Kansas
State's Quincy Morgan and A&M's Robert Ferguson have been pretty good this
season. Williams will certainly land on any all-newcomer teams, however.
Williams ranks first among true freshmen in NCAA Division I-A in receiving
yards (724), TD catches (7) and yards per catch (20.1). He ranks second
nationally among true freshmen in receptions per game (36).



Q: I hate to complain about anything after such a good win, but what's the
story behind our soft defense on opening drives? It seems that it takes a
series or two for us to settle in. Is every team we play coming out in some
strange offense that we haven't seen on film or something? After the first
drive (adjustments?), we generally shut everyone  down (with a couple of
obvious exceptions). Why can't we 3-and-out other  teams like they do us on
opening drives?
Cody Anderson, Houston

BROWN:  Mack Brown has talked all season about how he tells his team to be
prepared for an opposing team's "opening surge." He said he warned his team
about a possible opening surge by Oklahoma before that game, and sure enough,
the opening surge became a game-long surge. Warning about the opposing team's
opening surge has begged the question: Why shouldn't Texas be more concerned
about creating their own opening surge on both offense and defense? So far,
the Longhorns have seemed to be prone to the opposing team's "opening surge"
before settling down.


Q: Who's fault is it for the drops on short passes from Chris Simms? Is it
Simms' fault for throwing too hard, or the receivers for not being able to
catch a ball with zip?
Lawrence Martin

BROWN:  Simms said he is going to start taking something off of those
passes. He said he doesn't even think about it. He said he just throws it,
not realizing that some of the those short, dump passes are being thrown with
the velocity of a Roger Clemens' fastball. Simms said he then walks over to
the sidelines and hears people saying, "Can you throw it any harder?" So look
for Simms to tone down the heat on some of those short passes. His deep
passes, however, were phenomenal against Kansas. Just the right zip.



Q: How long has the Texas-Texas Agame not been played on Thanksgiving?
Pete Barnes

BROWN:  UT and Ahave not met on Thanksgiving for seven straight years
(including this one). The UT-Agame has been hosted 60 times on Thanksgiving
Day. The last four have been played on the Friday following Thanksgiving.
Texas is 27-18-3 in non-Thanksgiving Day contests vs. A&M. The last time the
two teams met on Turkey Day was 1993.



Q: Someone was telling me that Texas holds the record for players taken in
the NFL draft, is that right?
Randall

BROWN:  Yes. Texas has had a player drafted in an NFL-record 63 straight NFL
drafts.
