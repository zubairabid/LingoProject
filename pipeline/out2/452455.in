Steve:

Information on the Financial Sector's ISAC.  Key question is will we qualify
for membership - see para 3.
If we qualify as a "designated financial services exchange and finance sector
utilities" this ISAC will work for us.
If not, I recommend we join the Oil & Natural gas ISAC.  I will forward
information on NERC's process shortly - Pete

You would not avoid the expense or loss of reputation of an unexpected
