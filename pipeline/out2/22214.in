Rep. Archer did a great job today filming the spot.  Fyi, we will put it up
on Thursday and hold a news conference that same day with  four Republican
state reps and preview the spot for TV and the  chronicle.

Would you send Archer a short note thanking  him, Sharon and Don Carlson, his
aide, for their excellent  effort?

Thanks. Everything is good. Our four day tracking  poll (we are tracking
every night except friday and saturday) shows us  up 59-34. Give the
opponents all the undecided and we are still in  shape to coast in 55-45--a
20 point turnaround from  '99.
