Positive Living Tip of the Day
Friday December 1, 2000

Get Rid Of The Past!

Do you struggle with the questions, "Will I ever recover?" and "Will I ever
lead a normal life?" If so, you must begin to think positively!

Whatever your emotional wounds, you can eventually heal and lead a positive
life. This is what you must say to yourself in order to lead the best life
possible. Remember, the journey to living positively begins with a single
step. Be patient with yourself along the way and take credit for your
progress.

For example, if you are the victim of childhood abuse, it's normal for you to
question your abilities to parent for fear of abusing your own children. But
many abused children grow up to be great parents who "choose" not to follow
in the footsteps of their abusers. However, if you have decided not to have
children due to this fear, give yourself credit for making the best decision
for yourself at this particular time in your life.
