Steve:  Some of the guys may bring their family (will share the same room)
and stay a couple of days after the meeting ends.  Is there a problem with
them staying on at the lodge?  If not, please let me know how soon you
need to know how long they plan on staying.
This is all I can think of right now.  If anything else comes up I will let
you
know.
Thanks and have a great day!
