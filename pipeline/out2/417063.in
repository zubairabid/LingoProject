It appears that will not be able to execute the proposed financial hedge with
BCS today, but all parties should be commended for their efforts.  Monday
July 3rd and Tuesday the 4th are recognised "Enron" holidays.  I will be out
of the office returning Monday July 10th.  If there is a desire to pursue
this matter in my absence, please contact Mr. Chris Foster via e-mail or
telephone (503) 464-3822.  Thanks again.   John
