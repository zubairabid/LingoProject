A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully
interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they
limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day
month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all
business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that
would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately
supported with additional credit documentation, i.e., a letter of credit or a
increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.
