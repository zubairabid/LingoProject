Karen - I will ask legal to forward you the draft of the loan document as
soon as it becomes available.  I expect it by the end of this week.  If that
changes I will let you know.  As for your question regarding the amount, the
worksheet is simply an attempt to capture the potential maximum needs based
on certain assumptions.  Depending on the positions we have in place, the
various business lines could offset each other, but they could also be
additive.  I tried to pick a middle ground for my request so that there is a
realistic expectation of what the potential needs could be.  As for Global
Finance, Sarah is back in the office so she will be handling the FASH.
Lastly, I am currently assuming that the Peoples loan will mirror our loan
with identical caps.  However, we have not presented a draft to Peoples yet
for their review so they may have other ideas which they have not
communicated yet.

Thanks,

Gregg
