The Following memo will be hand delivered to you in hard copy form on Tuesday
morning, Feb. 20.  We will enclose the pledge form and
an Enron matching gifts form for your convenience.




Our meeting with Bob May, Dean of the McCombs School of Business at
UT-Austin, was a great success.  We had 14 attendees who received an update
from Bob about the many great things going on in Austin, as well as
opportunities to participate in the &We,re Texas8 capital campaign.

After Bob,s presentation, the 14 Enron officers met separately and were
extremely supportive about the idea of contributing in a coordinated manner
to the McCombs School.  This was evidenced by an expression of intent in
giving totaling about $175,000 from just the 14 people!

Here is what we propose and how it would work.

1. The UT Alumni at Enron would pledge $1 million over four years to the
McCombs School.  This would consist of $500,000 of gifts from employees and a
matching $500,000 from Enron.

2. The matching program provided through the McCombs gift to the Business
School would match the $1 million.

3. The result would be a permanently endowed $2 million &Enron Chair8 to
support &star quality8 faculty for the school.  This will represent one of
the largest Faculty Chairs at the Business School.

A few additional details:

1. Each individual,s contribution will also be credited to their name (along
with the Enron match) for recognition purposes in Business School,s Annual
Report, President,s Associates, etc.  In other words, a $10,000 contribution
matched by Enron will be considered as a $20,000 contribution by that
individual for recognition purposes.

2. Enron has agreed to not count it,s match against an employee,s annual
matching gift limitation of $15,000, as long as the gift is coordinated in a
way that makes it a part of the &Enron Chair8.

3. The gift may also be counted toward any previous pledge made to the &We,re
Texas8 campaign as long as that pledge is not supporting a separately named
contribution.  Please let us know that this is your intent.

Please carefully consider this request.  I do not plan to finalize the pledge
until I receive responses from enough officers to support this contribution.
We have about 40 officers of Enron who are UT alumni and with some
participation by each of us, we will achieve this level of gift.  Our plans
are to follow this up with a broader opportunity for all Enron employees that
are UT alumni; however, the leadership of the group will determine our
success.

Thanks for your consideration and continuing support of The University of
Texas.
