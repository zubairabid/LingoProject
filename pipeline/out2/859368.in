This week, Texas faces the man whom UT officials considered a finalist for
the Longhorns' coaching job awarded to Mack Brown. The Longhorns travel to
Boulder, Colo., and meet Gary Barnett's Buffaloes.

No team has ever beaten Texas seven straight times. But that's exactly what
the Buffaloes will be trying to do this week. Colorado has won six straight
against UT dating to 1989. Texas last beat Colorado in the 1975 Bluebonnet
Bowl, and hasn't won in Boulder since 1941.

Two of the last three UT-CU games have been decided on the final drives. The
Buffs won on a final-play field goal in Austin in 1994, and the Longhorns'
Hail Mary pass fell incomplete in a 28-24 loss in Boulder in 1996.

Here are some comments from Barnett in his weekly news conference:

On the play of his team in its first victory of the season over Texas A&M:
"The play of our offensive line was the most dominant we've had. I felt like
the line and all the kids really cut it loose for the first time this season.
We were a much more focused team."

On Texas: "Texas is the most talented team we'll face this year, maybe in a
couple years. They are loaded with talent on both sides of the ball, and they
have depth. You've got to think after their loss (to Oklahoma), they will
come in here really inspired. It should be a good matchup. The obvious
challenge for us is to hold up defensively against their passing game."

On Mack Brown: "What I've been most impressed with Mack is his ability to get
players. He's forced the hand of a lot of players and gotten commitments
early. They have been able to hand-pick the players they want out of Texas.
When you can get Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson and Sloan Thomas in the same
class, something is going on. Something good. We recruited all of those
players. The hype around Simms had something to do with it, too. Receivers
want to play with a good quarterback."


Longhorn Q & A
Q:What's the deal with the QB rotation this week? And were there any other
promotions to the starting lineup?
Marge Ringer

BROWN: Major Applewhite was named the starter for the Colorado game on
Tuesday by coach Mack Brown. Brown said Chris Simms would only be used on a
"need-to-win" basis, meaning that for the first time this season, there is no
plan to play both QBs this week. The coaches are hoping that by turning the
offense over to Applewhite exclusively, there will be a spark. UT offensive
coordinator Greg Davis said, however, that Texas could go back to the QB
rotation after this week. The coaches will wait and see. As far as other
promotions, B.J. Johnson will start at flanker ahead of Brandon Healy and Roy
Williams will start at split end ahead of Montrell Flowers. The coaches made
these promotions, in part, to help encourage Williams and Johnson to take
more of a vocal leadership role. And coaches said freshman tight end Brock
Edwards might see more playing time, and running back Kenny Hayter will see
more carries than the two he had against OU last week.

Kenny Hayter

Q:I'm having trouble understanding why the Longhorns will not put in a bigger
running back during first and second down to increase their chances at a
third-and-short situation. I believe Hodges Mitchell is more of a third-down
back who is better suited for throwing to out of the backfield than he is a
guy who can pound the ball straight ahead and pick up four to six yards on
first and second down. Watching the game last week and previous games as
well, I've noticed too many times that Texas has put itself in third and
long  situations due to not

picking up anything on the first two downs. Kenny Hayter, in my opinion, is a
more physical back who doesn't go down as easy. They should put him in there
on first and second down to pick up some positive yardage, and bring in
Hodges to run draw plays and block on third down since he has good hands and
is a reliable blocker.
Eric Barker, Plano, Texas

BROWN: Texas got behind so early against Oklahoma that the running game
became a moot point. Mack Brown said he should have run the ball more in the
second half to grind out the clock and keep the score closer. But he said he
was foolish enough to think his team could come back, so UT tried to throw
and score quickly. Hayter took most of the first-team snaps in practice this
week, so look for him to get more of a chance against Colorado.



Q:What recruits were on the sideline for the OU game?
Lance Kyles

BROWN: None. Texas was the visiting team. Only the home team is allowed to
bring recruits to UT-OU game. So UT will be allowed to bring recruits to next
year's OU game.



Q:Why did Kenny Hayter get only two carries? Why didn't our defense get
pressure on Josh Heupel? Why do we run so many 5-yard patterns on offense?
Give us the answers, Chip. What are the coaches' comments on these  topics?
Cody Anderson, Houston

BROWN: I think I've pretty much answered the Hayter question. The running
game became somewhat irrelevant in the OU game pretty quickly because UT was
forced to pass to try to get back in it. But Hodges Mitchell did get a lot of
time, mostly because he ran for 204 yards in last year's OU game and because
he is the bigger receiving threat. Look for Hayter to get more carries this
week. It's hard to believe that Shaun Rogers makes that big of a difference,
but Casey Hampton said UT would have gotten more pressure on Heupel if Rogers
was in there. Rogers is expected to play this week. The 5-yard patterns,
according to offensive coordinator Greg Davis, are the routes that the
defense is giving Texas. The coaches want the receivers to become more like
running backs after the catch and use their speed and moves to break for big
yards.



Q:I began following Longhorn football when I arrived at UT in  1995, and no
one was more shocked than me when the alumni and DeLoss Dodds  turned on John
Mackovic so viciously after the loss to UCLA in 1997. Not only was I appalled
at the time, but I was even more horrified to learn that  this was par for
the course for UT football coaches. Mack Brown seems to have been truly
embraced by the community over the last two years, but I'm  worried we are
about to see a repeat of history. What do you think?
Lisa Davis, Austin

BROWN: I was surprised at the venom being spit this week in and around
Austin. People were talking about hiring John Mackovic as offensive
coordinator or bringing in Spike Dykes to talk to UT about how to respond
after being blown out. All of this is crazy. Now, I will grant you that this
game with Colorado is do-or-die as far as the Big 12 title. If UT loses it,
the Horns will pretty much need the rest of the Big 12 South to fall apart in
order to get into the league title game. But if UT wins, the Horns are really
in the driver's seat for the Big 12 South title. I say that because the
chances of OU winning two of three against No. 1 Nebraska, No. 2 Kansas State
and at Texas Aare slim. The chances are good the Sooners will emerge with at
least two losses in those games. Texas can get right back in the race with a
win Saturday. If the Longhorns do win and UT looks good with Major Applewhite
at QB, then everyone will say "I told you so, Mack" regarding the QB rotation
having slowed down UT's offense all season. But the critical fans will also
embrace Mack and move on. If Texas loses, I think people will be upset, but
they will also need to get behind Mack Brown and start building support for
the rest of this season and next season. Mack Brown isn't going anywhere.
He'll be around Texas for a good while.

Casey Hampton

Q:I know I have no right to criticize coaching because I don't have any idea
what I would do in their situation. Having said that, I now must say that
after a while, one begins to wonder about the coaching. You've said  numerous
times that the coaches shouldn't be blamed for the Longhorns'  inconsistency,
and most of the time I agree with you. However, this pattern  UT seems to
follow amazes me. Every few games, everything just blows up and  we are
embarrassed. How can a team with such obviously great talent manage  to screw
up horribly in random

games? My only thought is that it has to be  the coaching. It's not like the
players aren't good enough. Kenny Hayter  proves in the OSU game to be the
solution to the running game's problem.  Why replace him the next weekend in
a much bigger game with the truly  hard-working, but honestly inefficient
Hodges Mitchell? Why run the ball  over and over when it obviously doesn't
work? Or it could work, if the  right players were in... These things baffle
me. Do you think the coaching  is one of the problems? What can be done to
fix the inconsistencies that  are actually becoming consistent and developing
a pattern of embarrassing  losses? Last year there was N.C. State, and then
the last three awful  games. This year, it's  mediocre Stanford, and the good
but not THAT good  OU. Will it ever stop? Thanks, I enjoy your newsletter.
David Rowe, Austin

BROWN: I think the OU game was, to some degree, an aberration. Oklahoma got
it going and kept punching Texas in the face, and UT never got a punch in to
slow the Sooners down. Josh Heupel looked like Joe Montana, and the avalanche
was on. The biggest problem for Texas right now is no leadership on offense.
Giving the offensive reins to Major Applewhite this week is a great move, I
believe. It could give the Longhorns confidence, if it's not too late and the
offensive psyche hasn't been beaten down too much. The offensive line has no
vocal, emotional leaders. Antwan Kirk-Hughes is developing into that guy. But
none of the other guys are fiery, vocal guys. And Applewhite has been an
ineffective leader to this point because he has been so worried about whether
he is going to play well enough to stay in a game with this QB rotation.
Coaches can only do so much when it comes to leadership on the field. You
can't make a guy do more pushups and make him into a leader. That stuff is
inherent in players. Either you have it or you don't. On defense, Casey
Hampton and Shaun Rogers are the heart and soul. On special teams Beau Trahan
needs to take command. On offense, it's clearly Applewhite who will have to
step up. Maybe the end of the QB rotation will help him do that.



Q:Is it obvious to just fans or everyone that the Texas coaches fail to have
the team prepared each week and fail to provide the opponent with a new
wrinkle or two each week? The opposing team always seems to know what is
coming while Texas is always caught by surprise early on. On offense, the
play-calling is extremely predictable and increasingly  uncreative. On
defense, the opponents used what worked in previous weeks against Texas and
the defense never seems to have made an adjustment. The defense uses the same
blitzes without mixing things up enough. Both coach Reese and coach Davis
seem extremely stubborn and refuse to try something new for fear of a mistake
or setback. Well, we have suffered both, so why not give the players some
excitement and give the opposing team some uncomfortable feeling while on the
sideline after seeing something totally new? It seemed to work against OSU
with a little different blocking scheme. Good job but do it every week,
especially against the tougher opponents. Do you see these problems and
tendencies also?
Todd Purl

BROWN: In talking to Greg Davis on Tuesday, he said he is re-evaluating his
play calling and has questioned himself about the creativity of it. Texas has
done well in the shotgun, four-wide, one-minute offense. But Davis said just
using that set goes against their philosophy of trying to be balanced 50-50
with the run and the pass. At some point, and maybe this week, if that line
can't open any holes for the backs, it will be time to give up hopes of being
balanced and throw the ball out of four wides and use the pass to set up the
run. We'll see if things improve this week. There is no question that the
coaches are rethinking EVERYTHING right now. Davis also said he has gotten
after the offense for all the penalties that have been killing early drives.



Q:I am a Longhorn fan who tries to be realistic. Win alot, lose some -- be
realistic. One thing that is very disturbing to me now, above winning and
losing, is the following: After the last four big games, some Longhorn has
said "the other team just wanted it more" After Oklahoma, it was Hodges
Mitchell who said it. I remember reading the same comments after Arkansas and
Nebraska. Why do you think our players are not as hungry as our opponents? Or
is it the players will not give it up for Mack Brown as the Sooners might
for Bob Stoops, the Hogs do for their coach, etc.
Mike Engelman

BROWN: This is an interesting question and one that I think is very telling.
When Texas was the underdog or was still surging from the depths of 4-7 under
the new attitude brought in by Mack Brown, the Longhorns got up for teams
like Nebraska (1998 and 1999) and Texas A(1998) and won. But now that Texas
is the favorite in every game, the Longhorns are struggling. Even though
Brown built North Carolina into a national power by the end of his tenure
there, the Tar Heels were never expected to win a national title. But with
everything Brown has done to stir up interest and belief in Texas (recruiting
star players, beating Nebraska twice, re-establishing tradition), he will be
expected to contend for a national title here in the very near future. So he
has to find ways to get his team on edge for games such as OU, even when the
Sooners have every reason to beat the Longhorns. The past five losses have
all come against teams who appeared to have more reasons to beat UT than UT
had to beat them - Texas A(revenge and the bonfire tragedy), Nebraska (had
been beaten by UT three straight times), Arkansas (finally back in the Cotton
Bowl, looking to beat its old rival), Stanford (coming off 69-17 loss to UT
in 1999) and Oklahoma (loser of three straight to UT). If Texas has any hope
of fending off teams looking to make a name for themselves with a win over
Texas, Brown will have to find ways to equalize the incentive factor and make
his team more hungry. Again, some of that will have to come from leadership
among players. Some of it will be Mack Brown reinventing himself or
constantly arousing the senses of his players in different ways.

Greg Davis

Q:It was quite obvious from watching the game Saturday that we were
thoroughly outplayed in all phases of the game. Even more disappointing is
the fact that we were thoroughly outcoached, too. I am convinced that are
offensive schemes will continue to be inconsistent, at best, against the
better defenses in the country. To support my argument, I reviewed the last
seven games (including this one) we have played against "good" defenses
(K-State, Nebraska twice, A&M, Arkansas, OSU, OU). The results are terrible.
We have averaged 216 passing yards per game (would rank

54th in the country in 2000) and 52 rushing yards per game (112th in the
country in 2000). Our total offense of 268 yards per game would rank 99th in
the country in 2000. Although this review could be construed as overly
conservative, it still makes my point that our offense is well below average
when facing better defenses. I feel like Greg Davis is getting too much
credit for our offensive output against bad defenses, resulting in a failure
to see the inherent weaknesses in our scheme. I would like your comments on
this prevailing problem and I would also like to know where Kenny Hayter was
on Saturday!  Thanks,
Lane

BROWN: I tend to think that Davis does need to mix things up a little bit
more. Perhaps by having one QB running the offense, things will settle down,
and some more offensive flow will result. I think the answers may begin
there. Perhaps if Applewhite can get things moving without fear of being
yanked, the confidence will spread everywhere, including the booth where
plays are being called. Without question, when a team is struggling, the
tendency is to simplify. Well, UT can't afford to simplify its offense
anymore.



Q:Why did the coaching staff remove, or go away from, the quick-strike, no-
huddle offense that was used in the first game? The team seemed to come
alive when they began using that offense, along with the appearance of Major
Applewhite. I believe if this offense would have been used against Stanford,
the team would have been unbeaten going into OU. The quick-strike offense
did not make another appearance until a dire situation in the OU game. Then
when the Horns used it, they moved the ball down the field and scored. Why
not  use this more and keep the defense guessing? Unlike most coaches, I
believe  with this style of offense, the pass will set up the run, and we all
would  love to see a consistent running game.
Brian Gannon

BROWN: I will quote Greg Davis when I asked him the same question: "The
one-minute offense creates a tempo. It forces the game to go up-tempo because
it's a situation where everything is done at the line. The argument against
using it as a standard offense is that it goes against our overall philosophy
of being balanced, 50-50, with the run and the pass."


Q:The OU game was an unmitigated disaster from start to finish with no
redeeming features  whatsoever which sets the program back at least a year,
if not more. So tell us something good, Chip ... PLEASE!
Rowell Rogers, Denton

BROWN: Again, if Texas wins this week, the Longhorns are back in the driver's
seat for the Big 12 South, in my opinion. I would be surprised if Texas
doesn't bounce back with its best effort of the season. If there is a clear
hangover, and Texas loses, it will be time to take the bad with the good. For
every 1998 storybook season, there is a season where everything doesn't fall
into place as expected. But let's see what happens this week. The effects of
the OU game won't set the program back a year unless the Longhorns let it. If
UT bounces back this week and wins, the Longhorns have a pretty good schedule
to get to the Agame with only one league loss. Let's see what happens.



Q:You stated that every QB would benefit from a redshirt year unless they
were Michael Vick. Michael Vick redshirted at Virginia Tech and benefited
greatly from it. It was even his idea. They made a pretty big deal about it
last year.
Brad Livingston

BROWN: I stand corrected. But even in my error, I proved my point. I said all
freshmen benefit from a redshirt year, and Chris Simms probably would have,
too. I should have stated that Vick is the perfect example. Thank you for
setting the record straight.



Q:It seems as though Major Applewhite has a better connection with the
receivers than Chris Simms does. Do you think this is legit or is it merely
coincidence since Simms has been starting and the receivers are cold, but
Applewhite comes into the heat of the game when everyone has started to run
on all cylinders? Also, why is the coaching staff giving Simms every chance
to win the starting position when it is obvious to fans, coaches, and
opponents that Applewhite is the leader and the one to watch out for? Surely
if Simms lives up to his pedigree as everyone hopes, he wouldn't have his
feelings hurt if he lost the starting job to someone superior to him.
Brandon May

BROWN: Simms said this week that if the coaches went solely with Applewhite,
he could live with it as long as it was best for the team. He said he has
been pressing and that interceptions have become a regular negative in his
play. He said the grade he would give himself this season would be terrible.
But he says, in his heart, he believes he will show everyone the promise that
has been expected of him since leaving high school as the nation's top QB
prospect.



Q:What role is Courtnee Garcia playing this year on the football team? Is
Miguel McKay on the football team?
Poorun Patel, Lufkin

BROWN: Courtnee Garcia fell way behind after pulling a hamstring in the
pre-season. He hasn't been able to capture sizable playing time as yet. And
he lost his punt return duties to Hodges Mitchell and has even fallen behind
Nathan Vasher as a backup in that role. So Garcia needs to try to convince
the coaches in practice that he deserves some playing time and then make the
most of it. Otherwise, there may not be enough snaps at split end (Garcia's
position) behind Roy Williams and Montrell Flowers. Miguel McKay is on the
team and got playing time at defensive tackle against OU.



Q:Since all of the big programs are operating under the same recruiting
restraints, I don't think its unreasonable to expect more out of the recruits
that Texas has. UT has had as good of a haul of recruits over the last 3-4
years as any program in the country. Using the logic that has been offered up
by some UT followers, we should be patient and wait until next year or the
next. At that point, we will be waiting for the inexperienced defensive
tackles to mature ... or some other aspect of the team. I don't know where
the actual difference between the dominant programs and UT is, but I would
guess that it has something to do with getting "senior" performance from
underclassmen. Whether that is a product of the recruiting or motivation, I
don't know. What do you think?
Kevin P. McCarthy

BROWN: I think it's fair to expect a lot from this team next year with the
schedule UT has. And once Texas shows that it can crack the top 10 without
losing before the end of October, and if Mack Brown can keep getting star
high school recruits, the Longhorns will be expected to be in the top 10 from
then on. So starting next year, I think it's fair to put Texas in the top 10
and expect them to stay there all season. The UT Towers freshmen receiving
corps will have a year of experience. Leonard Davis will be gone from the
O-line, but Robbie Doane should be a suitable replacement, and UT will have
all its running backs back except for Hodges Mitchell. The defense will lose
two first-round NFL draft picks (Casey Hampton and Shaun Rogers), but Marcus
Tubbs and Stevie Lee should be suitable replacements. The senior leadership
in other areas will have to make up for the loss of this year's key seniors.



Q:The addition of Roy Williams has helped Major Applewhite open up the
offense because he is a big-play receiver. As a supporter of the Garland
Owls, I got to witness B.J. Johnson in a big-game situation in last year's
semi-final game. He was an awesome player last year until that semi-final
game. Will he be as big of a threat as Roy Williams?
Tyrance "Duke" Barnett, Garland, Texas

BROWN: I think both of these guys will be outstanding. And more importantly,
their leadership will be needed on this offense beginning Saturday. As Mack
Brown says, freshmen are only freshmen until mid-season. Then they have to be
and play like upperclassmen. But Williams and Johnson will both be
outstanding, in my opinion.



Q:Mack Brown should be HEAVILY criticized for his poor handling of the QB
situation. Major Applewhite has never done anything but show he is one of the
most confident, proven leaders from the QB position in the nation. In my
opinion, not even his injury or the fact that Chris Simms got a lot of reps
in the spring warranted even a thought of him having to share time. You can
say what you want, and Brown would obviously talk around this, but we would
not have lost the Stanford game if Applewhite had started and played the
entire game. Both QBs, and the offense as a whole, have not played up to the
level they're capable of playing because of the inconsistency at QB. A QB
controversy creates doubt and a lack of confidence for everyone involved. The
coaches, media and fans have fallen in love with an unproven commodity, all
the while shucking aside an individual who did everything possible to prove
he should be the starter. Mack Brown's job is to be above that, and it's time
for him to take the heat. The media and fans are touching on this, but I
think it's time to tell it like it is with his illogical, failed and unfair
experiment.
Jason Stone

BROWN: Amen, Jason. You have spoken, and the rotation has come to an end. At
least for this week.



Q:Is there a start time for the Missouri game on Oct. 21?


BROWN: Not yet. ABC has opted to use its 6-day window to determine which
games it will televise that weekend. Right now, it's possible that the game
could be at 2:30 p.m., 6 p.m. or 1 p.m. It definitely will not be at 11 a.m.
Stay tuned.
