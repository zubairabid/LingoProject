Here's my little bit of info:

GE (S & S) - I've spoken with Lee Johnson (commercial lead) and have traded
voice mails with Kent Shoemaker regarding the project specific turbine
contracts.  I'm requesting a meeting with them on Thursday to iron our
details.    I requested a revised draft this week (from Andrews & Kurth), but
have not received it yet.

ABB - I've swapped calls with Mike Sandrige (their commercial lead) about it,
but haven't connected.  The contract is more straight forward, so problems
are not expected.  Initial draft of the project specific contracts has been
prepared.

Blue Dog - Is that GE equipment? Sheila may have someone she wants to work on
it.  If not, I can fit it in since it relates to what I'm working on with the
GE contracts.

Austin - this is Stuart's project.
