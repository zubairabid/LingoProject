Listed below are some of the questions that the eThink Team receives
frequently - with their answers.  We appreciate your interest and
participation in eSpeak, and hope that this document helps with any
outstanding questions you may have.

I barely have enough time during my workday to fit in most of my meetings, so
how can I participate in an hour-long eSpeak session?
We understand Enron's pace, which is exactly why we created the following two
options:
If you have a question for a particular host, you can pre-submit a question
as soon as their announcement appears on the site at ethink.enron.com.  We
try to post this information at least one week in advance.
You can also read any of the transcripts following an eSpeak event by
clicking on the "Archives" button on the bottom right hand corner of the
screen.

How do I pre-submit a question?
Go into eSpeak and find the announcement of the host that you wish to send a
question to.
Click on the "Enter Here" button below the host's information.
Click on the "Ask a Question" button, which will then prompt you to enter
your user name and password.
After entering your user name and password, a text box will appear on your
screen.
Enter your question in the text box and then click on the "Send" button.

Do I have to log in to view an eSpeak event even if I don't want to ask a
question?
No.  You are only required to log in if you will be asking a question.

How do I sign up on eSpeak to ask a question?
When you click on the "Ask a Question" button, you will be prompted to enter
your user name and password.
If you have not previously signed up, click on the "New User" button. You
will be prompted to enter your email address and operating company.
A user name and password will be automatically sent to your email address.
Use the specified user name and password to log onto the site.  (The easiest
way to do this is to copy and paste the password from your email.)
You will be immediately prompted to change your password once you are in
eThink.

Can offices outside of Houston also participate in eSpeak?
Absolutely!  This site was created for every Enron employee around the
globe.  It is available for every employee that has a browser and has access
to the Enron network.  You can enter eSpeak through the eThink site directly
at ethink.enron.com or from the Enron intranet (home.enron.com).  We try to
schedule most events at a time that captures the majority of our domestic and
international offices ) but have included several options (see first
question) to ensure that employees worldwide can participate.
