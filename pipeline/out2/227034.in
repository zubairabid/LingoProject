Hi Sara, I have spoken to PPL and they want us to review their confirm and
let them know what we do not agree with.  They do not want to sign our
confirm when they are the seller.  The lady I spoke with is in the contracts
department (she is not an attorney) but she wanted you to talk to her first.
Her name and phone number are as follows:

Ann Lovett
(610) 774-4716

Thanks,
