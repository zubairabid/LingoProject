Please read Brian's memo below.  We spoke briefly about this yesterday in the
staff meeting.  I have copied each of you on a memo earlier today where I
have provide the 2000 Plan allocations.  Please note that we were not making
changes to the Plan, only breaking the Gas Asset group into smaller buckets.
Any chnages which have been made since the budget was approved are NOT
reflected on the allocation sheet.  Rather they ARE reflected on the 1/00
allocations, and they will require explanations each month as all variances
from Plan do.  This includes new RC's which have set up, etc.
I need each of you to review the 2000 Plan allocations as I submitted them
earlier today, and provide an accurate allocation of your RC for 1/00.  What
has your group spent their time on in 1/00???  Please be aware that we could
receive questions from the Commercial teams, so document your logic.  Some
things to consider:
Project Sally - allocate to Gas Network Development
Project Hurricane - allocate to ???? - (I have a call into Jim Coffey)
Denver Business - allocate to Rocky Mountain Asset Originations
If you have some other activities and your not sure where to allocate them,
either call me, Jackie Nelson or Jim Coffey.
One other thing to note:  The Network Trading group will be further broken
down into 2 groups:  Trading (Tom Martin and Jim Schwieger) and
Transportation (Ed Gottlob).  Although the attached worksheet does not
include this breakdown, please include it in yours.
I would like you allocations back to me no later than Thursday, 1/20 @
3:00pm.  Thanks.
