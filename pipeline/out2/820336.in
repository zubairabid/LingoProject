Positive Living Tip of the Day

How To Control Anger

Want to start living positively instead of angrily? If so, get to the source
to your anger. For some, the roots of your anger may be hidden deep in your
childhood. Your anger may come from being exposed to lessons from a caregiver
who was abusive ("You hurt the ones you love").

People who have lots of anger from childhood may find themselves unable to
control their anger, or feel the need to appear "tough." Sometimes they seek
out victims so that they can play the role of the abuser in an unconscious
attempt to understand why the earlier abuse occurred.

Anger CAN be controlled. Get control of your anger by learning where it first
started. Then deal with your anger in a constructive way. Talk to loved
ones--or a professional--to understand why you feel the way you do and how to
get on the road to a happier, healthier life.
