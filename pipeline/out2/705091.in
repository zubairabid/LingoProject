Bill, we had an air inspection at the facility a couple of weeks ago and
all went well.  Prior to the state visit, we went through a "trouble
shooting" scenario and found out that Solar provided us with innacurate
permitting information for that altitude and temperature.  Solar was very
helpful and provided us with updated information to reflect conditions at the
facility.  I submitted a permit revision and it was submitted to the state of
Colorado prior to their inspection, requesting more fuel but no more
emissions.  Recent testing has shown that even under extreme low
temperatures, the emissions are under the original permitted levels.  Because
we did not request additional emissions, I expect the permit to be issued
within the next couple of months..... bottom line is that no NOV will be
issued for the fuel use issue.
