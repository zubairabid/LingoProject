Some notes on the attached lists:

3/24/00 List - the first two counterparties have no Legal changes per my
earlier approvals.

3/27/00 List-we just got the financial master in signed and they cannot do
pulp & paper and weather under it.
Ambac Assurance Corp. and Salomon Smith Barney AAA Energy Fund - I have a
temporary "no" for them for financial products until I get more information
on them to determine what they are and what they can do.  Per Credit, AMBAC
only wants to trade credit derivatives, and Salomon Smith Barney is currently
not an eligible swap participant and cannot trade any financial.  If we get a
parent guaranty in that can change their eligible swap participant status.
In the meantime I am trying to get more information on the fund to determine
what if anything they can do.

3/28/00 List-I previously had them shut down for all financial but am opening
them up.   I sent an email about that earlier this week.
