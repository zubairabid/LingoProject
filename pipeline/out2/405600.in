Hi yourself,

Glad to hear you all had a good time in Thailand, although I get the
impression you could have done without some of the sights.  Mom thinks it
must be fate that this guy and I keep bumping into each other.

Along those lines, I had an absolutely incredible weekend.  I drove to
Harlingen Saturday morning/afternoon (5 hr. drive) for a friend's wedding and
then drove to Austin to meet up with Emily on Sunday.  We ate at Guerro's and
then hit Cedar door for a little while.  There wasn't anything going on there
so I suggested we try Cedar Street.  Funny thing is Ted, that's his name,
walks by our table at the bar.  He stopped to say hello and ended up sitting
down with us the rest of the evening.  His friends joined us as soon as they
had been shot down by the girls they had been trying to woo.  We ended up
going to Polly Esters for a little while to do some dancing.  Before we
parted ways he asked if we had any plans for Monday night and got my cell
phone number.  Needless to say I was feeling pretty good.  He called us
Monday and we made plans to meet up after dinner -- we ate at Sullivan's, it
was very good.  His birthday is July 4 (how great is that?) so I brought him
one of those travel size bottles of Crown from the honor bar as a birthday
gift...Big Hit.  Anyway, spent the whole night talking and getting to know
each other and all I can say is he seems like a really good guy.  (One of the
best signs was his reproach of denim shorts on guys, especially cut-offs...be
sure and tell Chuck about that one because I know it's something he feels
pretty strongly about as well.)  So at this point I'll pretty much just run
through the stats:

Height :   6'2" - 6'3"
Weight : about 225 lbs.
Education: UCLA (undergraduate and MBA) AND Law School ( I'm not sure where)
Birthday: 7/4/69 -- YES, he was born in a different decade than me...think it
may be more of an issue for him than me.
Hometown: Santa Barbara, CA

ETC:  Youngest of three children.  Appears to like/be close to his family.
Irish Catholic (we actually discussed religion)
His dad was in the Navy
Favorite Movies -- Fletch, Caddy Shack...he definitely has a good sense of
humor and likes to laugh
He really likes Texas...would like to have a ranch/lakehouse somewhere in
the hill country

Best Quotes:    "Every California guys idea of a dream girl is a girl in
jeans a t-shirt and cowboy boots."
"Every Texas girls idea of a dream guy is a guy who lives on a ranch, has
an good education, is comfortable financially and is also a great
businessman.  Only problem is there are only four of those guys out there and
three of them are married."
"Texas girls have the ability to wrap a man around their finger quicker
than any group of women I've ever met."
"I really want to learn how to two step."

So, as I'm sure you can tell there are definitely some attractive
characteristics to this guy (to boot he was a complete gentleman in every
capacity).  There are no plans as of yet, but I will be sure to keep you
informed of any progress.  Write back soon and let me know how the apartment,
the job hunt and everything else is going.

Susan
