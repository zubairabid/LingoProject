Have you taken the time to consider those employees that consistently make a
difference at Enron and should be considered for the Chairman's Award?  It's
those special individuals around us that bring our values to life...  Please
make sure your everyday hero is recognized by simply submitting a nomination
form on their behalf during this final week.

Every employee nominated will receive a memento honoring their nomination and
the ten heroes the most exemplify our values will claim their place on the
prestigious Chairman's Roundtable.  To see who's being nominated by business
unit or for a nomination form or sample submission, click here home.enron.com

Respectfully

Ken, Jeff and Joe
