Now that the Beavers are in the Fiesta Bowl, Oregon State University fans
everywhere are scrambling to get tickets for the big game. Athletic Director
Mitch Barnhart said on Sunday, "I have just been told by Fiesta Bowl
officials that the maximum number of tickets Oregon State University will
receive is 17,500, which is about 5,000 less than the original number that
was first discussed. I encourage fans in any way possible to use their
resources to obtain tickets(8

According to the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl web site, "A limited number of Standing
Room Only tickets for the Tostitos Fiesta Bowl will be available for sale on
Monday, December 4th at 2:00 p.m. MST through Ticketmaster at $75.00 each.
They are located at the top row of the stadium. All other tickets are sold
out."
