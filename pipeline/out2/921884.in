It is my pleasure to announce Scott and Barbara Pleus as the proud parents of
a new baby girl, Catherine "Cati" Elizabeth, born Saturday, April 29, 2000,
at 8:25pm.  Cati weighed in at a bouncing 6 lbs. and 4 ounces and stretched
out to 20 inches in length!

Due to the new arrival, Scott Pleus will be out of the office all of this
week.  If there are any meetings or appointments that needs Scott's immediate
attention, please contact me at (713) 853-3540.   In addition, Scott will be
checking into the office regularly, and can be reached at home during day
hours.

Again, please join me in saying "Congratulations!" to the Pleus family on
their new arrival.

Thank you,

Inga Latson
