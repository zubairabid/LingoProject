ShareBuilder News - IRAs, ADRs and a Special offer for Netstock Direct
Customers!

Dear Sara,

As a Netstock Direct customer (and a direct stock investor), we like to keep
you apprised of the many exciting things that we have going on with our
affiliated ShareBuilder product as well.  We realize that there are many
features of ShareBuilder that Netstock Direct customers may not be aware of
yet and the features just continue to get better and better.

$50 OFFER FOR SHAREBUILDER EXTENDED!!
We recently sent most of you an offer to receive $50 if you open an account
and start investing with ShareBuilder.  We had an overwhelming response from
Netstock Direct customers so we have extended this offer and it now expires
November 30, 2000!  We also had some new ShareBuilders asking if they could
introduce their family and friends to ShareBuilder and if they too would be
eligible for the $50 'Get Started' promotion.  I'm pleased to announce that
we will say yes on these requests, so feel free to share this special offer
with anyone you think would enjoy hearing about ShareBuilder.

To take advantage of this limited-time offer, simply go to
http://redir.cq0.net/r/default.asp?R=000003be9000346d2&promocode=NNF50EOCT -

first transaction occurs, we,ll credit your account with $50 to help you get
started.

foreign companies like Nokia, Toyota, Sony, NEC, Canon and Ericsson among
many others.  It's an easy way to get some international coverage in your
portfolio.

INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS  (IRAs) - COMING SOON!
I'm proud to announce that we will soon be adding NO FEE Individual
Retirement Accounts (IRAs) in time for the 2000 tax season.  Through
ShareBuilder you,ll be able to create a new IRA or roll over an existing one,
