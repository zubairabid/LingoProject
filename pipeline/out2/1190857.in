Matt,
Thank you for your note.   I understand that the reporting requirement
(According to the Korean Foreign Exchange Transaction Regulations("FETR"), a
prior report to the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative Transaction
whose underlying assets are not financial products, i.e., "Commodity
Derivative" by our own definition.) is a legal issue to be clarified and
handled carefully.   However, speaking with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai
Oil, I have the understanding that the Bank of Korea is willing to be
flexible enough to accommodate instantaneous on-line derivative trading.  We
might need official confirmation of this from the Bank of Korea, but I think
that, working with the Bank of Korea, we could find a solution to this legal
issue.   The following are some of the facts regarding the reporting
requirement issue:
Although the Bank of Korea has the legal discretion to reject any report
made, when I spoke with them a month ago, they emphasized their intention
that they would not reject any report unless the transaction falls under
either of the two categories stipulated in the Article 7-61 of the FETR (1.
option premium more than 20%,  2. illegal  transaction).
Early this week, I talked with the Bank of Korea and Hyundai Oil, and both of
them confirmed that since Apr. last year total 17 reports (from Hyundai Oil)
have been filed with the Bank of Korea regarding Oil derivative
transactions.   All 17 reports were submitted after the transactions had been
made (ex post facto reporting), and many times Hyundai Oil put 2-3
transactions together in one package (one-page filled out form per
transaction) for reporting.   That's why Kim & Chang, the local law firm, got
the information of 7-8 reports from the Bank of Korea.
Both Hyundai Oil and the Bank of Korea said that the report is more like a
notification and that the Bank of Korea just checks whether the transaction
falls under either of the said 2 categories.  As far as a transaction does
not fall under either of the 2 categories, neither the Bank of Korea nor
Hyundai Oil  cares about the reporting.   The Bank of Korea does not insist
on reviewing the report prior to the transaction and does not care even if
the report is made even 1 or 2 weeks later.   That's why sometimes it takes a
week for the Bank of Korea to return the report with its seal on it.   The
Bank of Korea said that normally it takes less than one hour to review and
place its seal on a one-page report.
Regarding the Weather Derivatives, there is an issue whether Weather
Derivatives will be classified as a Commodity Derivative or a Financial
Derivative since Korea has no experience with such a product.   In the FETR,
there is a general definition of the "Derivative Transaction".   No separate
definition of the "Commodity Derivatives" or "Financial Derivatives".
However, the FETR treats the Derivative Transaction whose underlying products
are commodity products like grains and metals differently from the Derivative
Transaction whose underlying products are financial products like interest
payments and foreign currencies.   For convenience' sake, I would call the
former the "Commodity Derivative" and the latter the "Financial
Derivative".    The FETR stipulates that a prior report to the Bank of Korea
is required for the Derivative Transaction whose underlying assets are not
financial products (i.e., Commodity Derivative by our own definition) and
that a prior approval of the Bank of Korea is required for the Derivative
Transaction whose underlying assets are financial products (Financial
Derivative by our definition) "among non-banking residents or between
non-banking resident and non-resident".   No approval or report is required
for the Financial Derivative Transaction if a banking institution is
involved.    When I talked to the Int'l Finance Dept. of the Bank of Korea,
which is responsible for the prior report and approval, they informally
indicated that the underlying asset of the Weather Derivatives doesn't seem
to be a financial product.  They said that they would need better
understanding of the Weather Derivatives in order to determine that formally.
I hope that Matt's note and the above information are useful for all of you
to understand the legal situation better.  Let's discuss and clarify these
issues in our conference call.  Thanks.
