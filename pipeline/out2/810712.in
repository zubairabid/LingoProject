Would you please set up an Amtel reminder to Chris Germany and me, as follows:
Date of notification:  March 1st, 2000
Message:  Deadline for CES Retail storage volumes is March 15-Call CES and
remind them.

Chris, I'm having Kim set this up so that you can call CES to get real
volumes for the Storage Exhibit, since their deadline to provide those
volumes to us is March 15.  Any questions, let me know.
