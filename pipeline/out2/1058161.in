I understand that due to Greg not responding to your requests, Net Works has
been removed from the PRC process for Analyst/Associates this year.

Although I understand that reassigning people is out of the question - I
would like someone present from Net Works to ensure fair representation.  I
do understand that Analyts and Associates are not represented by their
management but we do know that there is usually someone else from their group
present in the room to offer guidance should there be any issues.

Let me know if you have any problems with this.

Thanks

Louise
