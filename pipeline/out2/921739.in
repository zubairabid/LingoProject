Hi!

Thought about calling you this weekend but thought since you had been gone
most of the week I'd let your family have you all to themselves.

Did want to let you know I am changing jobs week after next.  Will be going
to viviance new education.  They are out of Switzerland.  I, of course,
will work for their N.A. subsidiary.  They are small, with other offices in
ITaly, France, UK, Spain, and Germany.  My passport is ready!

Check them out:  http://www.viviance.net

Will forward new work number to Patti when I am sure of what it will be.
Our offices are on 6th Street on the 2nd and 3rd floor of an old
building...will ride the bus...

Talk to you soon. Hope Canada was cool and your family is doing great.
