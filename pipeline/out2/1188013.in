I would like to consider some counterparty-specific agreement to solve this
problem.  What do you think of a side agreement among both KN entities and
Enron which specifies that a user ID and password have been issued to both of
KN's legal entities jointly and severally and that transactions for certain
products (e.g. all financial products) entered into under that user ID and
password will be deemed executed by KN Trading (their financial trading
entity) and all others will be deemed executed by KN Marketing (their
physical entity)?  Do you see any problems here?  Issues re: joint & several
liability under the ETA but not the Transactions?
Let me know if you need further clarification of the problem.
I haven't run this by Louise yet - she may raise system or commercial
objections.
