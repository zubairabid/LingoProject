If HR can not find this signed review, can Clara communicate with someone in
your group in Houston to be able to access a copy of the review by 11:00 am
on Friday?  That is the deadline for the final tally on completed reviews
(defined strictly by HR as their having received - and retained, I guess -
the signed review).  The goal is 100% completion by then, for reporting in
the ENA Office of the Chair staff meeting on Friday afternoon.  Although many
employees are now not under the ENA umbrella, we are tracking the completion
of reviews by their operating company assignment at the mid-year PRC time.
Thanks.

Of course, I believe you said that this guy left the company, and if that is
the case we may be alright without the review.  But getting a second copy
from Clara would probably be the best bet.  Thanks.
