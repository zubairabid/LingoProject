I have the feeling that Koch finally decided to consolidate their financial
trading with us into Koch Energy Trading.  They recently did a trade with our
coal desk between ECT and Koch Carbon Inc.  Do we have a contact in legal (or
elsewhere) at Koch we should call to see if they are willing to use Koch
Energy Trading?
