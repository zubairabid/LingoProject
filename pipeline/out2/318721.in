Attached is my cut at a closing checklist with timetables for distributing
documents.  Please review and edit it appropriately.  In particular, please
ensure that everything is addressed, including any additional items required
under the Letter Agreement.  In general, there are two deadlines -- Friday
for the form of Escrow Agreement (base it on the prior version, form of
Guaranty (although the Buyer may want their own unique terms, we can at least
present them with a form to expedite this process and ensure that our issues
are properly addressed), and forms of promissory note (although the Buyer
will want their own unique terms, we can at least present them with a form to
expedite this process) so that once one Buyer is indentified then we can
distribute those documents to them on Monday morning.  Then the other
documents necessary for the transaction such as the transmittal letters and
forms of membership certificates so that we can distribute those on Tuesday.
The targeted execution dates that I have are Friday for the Letter Agreement
and next Monday for the Closing.  Thanks and please call me with any
questions.
