Sara,
Okay, looks to me like Weyerhaueser wants us to act as their counsel.  I told
Bill to propose the language he wanted, but he said his lawyer was out of
town for two weeks.  Which makes me wonder if they can even sign this thing
without her consent, but I did not think to ask him this at the time.
Anyway, he basically wants to add a third party guarantee as eligible credit
support in the event of a downgrade.  He said he is willing to include
language indicating that the nondowngraded party would have to accept this
guarantee, subject to a commercially reasonable objection.  On its face, I
have no objection to such a provision, but would like to quickly bounce it
off of you.  I'm not sure that I want to be forced to disclose what that
reason is....
And basically, I also have no objection to allowing the posting of collateral
in a form and amount acceptable to the nondowngraded party, with such amount
subject to change as conditions warrant.
Also, I thought we usually had assignability to affiliates so long as the
guarantor remained the same.  I think Bill indicated we probably removed that
because we had it this way with the Canadian subsidiary.  He wants to put it
back in.  I want it back in as well.
Otherwise, we are increasing the guaranty amounts to $25MM, and they have
agreed to the cross default provisions.
Let's discuss this when you get a minute.  He had some additional
clarification he needed, but these seemed to be the legal issues on his
list.  I don't think there is going to be any way around this other than to
call him and explain.  Sorry.
