You are correct in that I do not need the emails.  However, when I receive
calls from Sheila or Gary or a counterparty, I rely upon  Lotus Notes and the
information is not there.  I know that everyone is working diligently to
satisfy the traders' requests.  The emails you are sending can be entered
directly into the database so that everyone can access the information.  I
will be glad to show you how to utilize this feature.
What do you think is a reasonable date to ask Sam and Stephanie to complete
their review of the brokerage agreements in Lotus Notes?
