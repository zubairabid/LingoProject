FYI - Beth Apollo led the doorstep review in Monterrey last week.  No problems discovered - but Beth did find some communications and system access issues that could be improved to make it easier for Max's team to do their jobs.  She has quickly identified a point person within Operations in Houston who is bi-lingual (Gordon).  Max's note addresses his pleasure over Beth's responsiveness and the doorstep process in general.  Just wanted to pass this along.  --Sally
