US  Negotiates at Climate Meeting


At the UN conference in the Hague, environmental groups are accusing
the US of seeking loopholes to avoid cutting pollution. The  conference
opened to set rules for reducing harmful gases released  into the atmosphere.
One major issue revolved around how much  countries could trade off against
their commitments to roll back  their own pollution by helping other
countries reduce theirs or by  planting new forests to absorb greenhouse
gases. The US advocates  unlimited emissions trading, but the EU and some
developing  countries fear it will defeat the effort to force the biggest
polluters to change their ways. The US argues that emissions trading  is the
most cost-effective way to meet the global target of reducing  greenhouse
gases by 5.2% from 1990 levels, and would give time for  the transition to
cleaner energy and expensive new technologies.  About 6,000 bureaucrats,
scientists, environmentalists and  businessmen attended the opening. That
number was expected to grow  to 10,000 during the second week with the
arrival of 100 government  ministers for the culmination of negotiations.
Months of talks have  preceded the conference. Three years ago at Kyoto,
governments drew  up targets for rolling back emissions of carbon-based gases
but  could not agree on the details. Europe agreed to cut emissions by  8%,
the US by 7% and Japan by 6%. Each was allowed to decide how it  would make
the required reductions. So far, 30 countries have  ratified the Kyoto
Protocol. Mexico is the most industrialized  country on the list, and none is
among the heaviest polluting  countries. The agreement needs the ratification
of 55 countries,  representing at least 55% of the harmful emissions, before
it will  come into force.
