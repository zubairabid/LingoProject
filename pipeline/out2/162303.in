San Diego Customers Seeking Lower Prices Choose EES: San Diego continues to
be a hotbed for EES National Energy Sales. At one point last week, an EES
representative closed four deals in one day. Conditions in the area are very
favorable for commodity sales, as prices for power remain volatile in San
Diego and consumers are eager to better manage their energy costs.
Facilitating efforts in San Diego are ready-to-use products from EES Market
Development ( including a matrix of executable prices and a ready-to-use
contract) that assist in the closure. See link to Deal Central:

Ken Lay Speaks at IOGCC Conference: At a conference held by the Interstate
Oil and Gas Compact Commission (IOGCC), Enron Chairman and CEO Ken Lay called
for regulators to allow the competitive natural gas market to continue to
offer solutions in reducing consumer exposure to rising prices. Lay warned
officials against overreacting to the recent run-up in prices and urged them
to encourage utilities to take advantage of opportunities to protect
consumers against price volatility. Lay also extolled the merits of
deregulation, pointing to the fact that &the natural gas market has delivered
more than $174 billion in savings to consumers since the market was opened to
competition in 1984.8 Lay also urged government officials to consider lifting
access restrictions to develop new gas supplies to meet the growing
electricity generation demand of the digital economy.

Opportunities for Energy Providers Wide-Open in the Supermarket Sector: A
recent Store and Equipment Design survey of supermarket operators reveals
that most retailers are not yet taking advantage of electricity deregulation.
It was noted that the typical survey respondent has stores in six deregulated
states, yet on average has changed energy suppliers in only two states. The
survey cited several reasons for this, including the fact that many retailers
find the process of bidding out energy procurement, comparing rates and
switching to be overwhelming. Some of the retailers who have considered
switching energy suppliers decided it would be too complicated to manage. In
addition, many retailers reported that the fees charged by utilities to
transport electricity from another power supplier eat up any savings that
retailers might realize.

According to the survey, when retailers have issued RFPs (request for
proposals) for energy commodity or outsourcing, on average, only three
proposals were received. Nonetheless, of those switching suppliers, 69
percent cited price as the number one reason for switching, while 28 percent
cited service. The survey reported that the majority of retailers are hopeful
that deregulation will have a positive effect on their energy bills in the
future. Click on link to read entire article (hit &zoom-in8 tool*looks like a

Wisconsin and Other States Slow Their Deregulation Process: An article in New
York Times that also ran in the Houston Chronicle discusses how a number of
states, such as Wisconsin, are adopting a &go-slow8 approach to deregulation,
so as to avoid the mistakes California has made. Initially, Wisconsin pushed
for state regulators to give up immediate control over the production and
pricing of electricity. However, as a result of a 1997 power shortage and the
developments in California, Wisconsin has decided to first build in an extra
margin of reliable power to fully meet the state,s growing electricity
demand. According to the article, most experts agree that a system where
power generators compete openly to provide electricity at market prices still
offers the best prospect of lower costs for business and consumers and higher
profits for utilities than is possible under the traditional system of
monopoly suppliers supervised by government regulators.

A Big Thank You to Those Who Participated in Day of Caring: Eighty-five EES
employees volunteered for the Day of Caring this past Friday. Volunteers took
up such activities as painting and landscaping at the DePelchin Children's
Center, which provides adoption and family services and offers more family
support programs for children, teenagers, and parents than any other
organization in Houston. Marty Sunde led an energetic team of Risk Management
employees in painting the gymnasium. Thank you to everyone who gave their
time for this effort. Click on link to check out photo of some of the

Wired Households Ready for Networking, Smart Appliances and New Services: Now
that a majority of U.S. homes have computers and Internet access, a new
national survey finds that consumers are ready to take the next step*namely,
linking their electronic devices together in home-based networks and using
their computers to communicate with appliances and energy control systems.
This spells opportunity for computer and major appliance manufacturers, who
are preparing to launch new &thinking8 devices during the fall shopping
season. Likewise, energy service providers have a business opportunity
through the adoption of power line communications applications to deliver
additional services to customers.
