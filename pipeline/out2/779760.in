NSM Bankruptcy Claim

Attached for your review and comment is a draft of the indemnification
portion of a claim by Enron entities in the NSM bankruptcy. I have tried to
make the claim as big as possible, which makes it rather vague and
wishy-washy. Maybe you can suggest changes.

At the risk of differing with Lisa and Paul, I really do not understand why
this is a good idea. It seems to me that any claim by Enron is an unsecured
claim, way down in priority, clearly behind all of the bondholders, at least
to the extent of their security. I don't understand how this claim creates
any threat to the plaintiffs or settlement pressure on anyone.

In addition, I hate saying the things we have to say to state a claim. In
the litigation, we consistently say that we did nothing wrong, we were
victims too, the few people who did sue us should see their mistake and
dismiss us. Now we propose to file a public document saying the opposite:
that we fear the suits that have been filed and we expect more, producing
tens--maybe hundreds--of millions of dollars of exposure.

While we should continue to move this aspect of Enron's claim along, so we
are ready to file if we want to, I think we should consider a conference call
among Lisa, Paul, Richard, and me to talk through the wisdom of the
indemnification claim. (I don't worry nearly so much about a fraud claim on
Enron's securities purchases, because that does not go against our litigation
position, although I still don't see what good such a claim would do.)
