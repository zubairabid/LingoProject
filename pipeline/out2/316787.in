I will be happy to review change order #5, and present to GE for their review
and approval.  First, it needs to be prepared by someone involved with the
project, and Finance needs to be notified that additional funding will be
required, if they don't know already.  As I mentioned in my email, there
needs to be a definitive decision made as to whether the change order should
be funded out of WestLB (prior to December 15) or will be funded through
TurboPark.
I faxed change order #2 to Al so that he has the form.  If this will be
funded through WestLB, the current contract value is $352,289,400.
Here is the electronic form:
