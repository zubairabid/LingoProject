Don't know what you are talking about.  They gave Sylvia their form with
their view of how the world should revolve around their wishes in October
2000.  She sent it up here is late January for Legal's initial review.  I
understand it mimics the Utilicorp agreement.  If you have some incite that
would lead you to believe that they would sign our Master, please send me a
credit worksheet so that I can prepare a Master Firm Purchase/Sale
Agreement.  Also please give me a contact so that we can forward the new
contract to that person for execution.
