HLH AT COB N/S.  Buy deal #s:  528046, 528048.  Sell deal #:  74885.2

Seattle called in this schedule to BPA incorrectly.  They tried call BPA with
the correction by their 2pm deadline, but got voice mail.  Therefore, if BPA
does not accept the schedule change/correction, SCL will call it in on
Real-time.  Even so, it should be transparent to RT.

Thanks, Donald.
