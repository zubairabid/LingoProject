Stan,

I'm thinking through that right now.  Frankly, the problem I see is in being
able to put an agenda together that would be attractive enough for our CEO
task force members.  I haven't figured out how to make a face to face meeting
before the September board meeting worthwhile, although a conference call
might work.  We probably could develop a formal task force response to the
strawman, but in some ways I think the first meeting notes, draft principles
and the concerns paper covered some of the turf.

So I'm thinking of an alternative - and please think of this only as a
maybe.  Suppose at the September board meeting I have a closed meeting on the
principles & scope & whatever else we can manage, and then have you come in
and talk to everybody in general session.  We could work out the content of
your talk, but it would be centered on the value of uniform practices, their
applicability to electric wholesale markets, and the "EISB" approach.
Perhaps we could get Chuck Watson to help you.

There would be tough and probing questions - which you would know in advance.

How does this sit with you?  I think it might be an interesting discussion
that would help to increase the collective knowledge and support.  I do not
have internal concurrence & support on this idea, but if you like it I'll try
to get it.

On another matter - I really need 5 or 6 examples  of areas where wholesale
electric practices would be useful and appropriate.  The question on the
floor is "Exactly what are the areas and types of practices we might develop
for wholesale electric markets?"

On the retail side the answer is easy, because we already have them (e.g.,
customer enrollment, billing & payments, metering,  load profiling, etc.).
But there really is no such list on the wholesale electric side.

Can you or Jeff help?  We can't just say "it's up to the members".  Having a
list would help demonstrate value.  I need something by next Thursday for an
internal strategy meeting.

Thanks
-Mike
