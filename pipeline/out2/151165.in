Dear Fellow Diver;

I know this is late and I am truly sorry. What an exciting month it,s been!

First, if you weren,t at Total Submersion, you missed out on something great!
I know I bought my share of drinks at My Bar at Sunset House in Grand
Cayman.  It was great meeting so many of you down there. We had almost one
hundred people in only our first year!  I would like to thank the staff of
Sunset House, Comfort Suites, and Treasure Island Resort, as well as the
great team from Sport Diver magazine, and of course our team from PADI and
PADI Travel Network for making Total Submersion event a great success.  The
weather was wonderful, the diving was incredible, the seminars were well
received, and everyone had a fantastic time.  But, you ain,t seen nothing
yet.  Stay tuned to see what we come up with for next year!

We are very proud of the recent recognition PADI received from the Maritime
Division of the Friends of War Memorials with regards to the recent change in
one of our Mission Statements Goals.  We are spreading the word to our
network of professionals and retailers and resorts to be respectful of wrecks
and the remains found on many wrecks around the world.  Reverend Andrew
Phillips from the Maritime Division in the United Kingdom acknowledged our
awareness campaign in an article in the UK Sport Diver magazine and in the
House of Commons in England.

I can,t tell you how many offers we,ve rejected to include advertising
materials or to even &rent8 this email list. Your faith in us not to do this
has resulted in a &remove8 or &unsubscribe8 rate that is practically not
measurable. In fact, it,s less than one thousandth of one percent monthly!

After some soul searching, I feel that a few of these offers are so good that
they would be of interest to you and contribute to my goal of keeping you
active in diving.  So, I,m going to try this for a while by including no more
than one promo item per month, clearly labeled as The Product of the Month.
And, you have my promise that you,ll only see the best of the best or you won,
t see anything at all. I know a few of you will find this a bit mercenary, as
I have always tried to keep the commercialism to a minimum.  If I get carried
away, don,t hesitate to let me know.

Thanks to all of you who responded to the requested feedback about the
Adventures In Diving Program.  Here,s what just a few of you had to say:

Hello, I just completed my advanced open water course, and I loved it.  I go
through Advanced Aquatic in St. Clair Shores, Michigan and our instructor is
Mark Kistner.  He is great, he really motivates you.  For my deep dive, he
suggested that I go up to the straights of Mackinaw, and that there was a
group going in 2 weeks.
Kathy from Roseville, MI

We did our course through the Waikato Dive Centre and really enjoyed it.  I'm
hoping to get my photos from my photography specialty tomorrow and hope they
turn out.
Thanks PADI.
Vicki from New Zealand

I've recently completed AOW as well as the photography, deep, wreck, and
naturalist specialties. Being a relatively new diver (OW certified last
spring) I've found that the AOW class and the specialties offer a great
opportunity to expand my skills.
Ron from Seattle, WA

Kathy, Vicki, Ron and about 200 other PADI Divers received a new Cordura Log
Binder for helping us with that feedback.  Thank you all and stay tuned for
more Dear Fellow Diver surveys.

OK, you have all been very patient waiting to find out who is going to Las
Vegas.  We received  more than 2,000 entries and the winner is Mr. Doug Clark
from Royal Oak, Michigan,.  He and a guest will travel from Detroit to Las
Vegas and have three days of fun and at least one great dive in Lake Mead on
me!  We will keep you informed of when he will be going and the details.
Thanks to all of you who sent entries and keep your eyes open for more in the
future.
