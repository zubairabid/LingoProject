Steve,

You requested that I put together a Knowledge Management working group.

To tell you the truth, I got the best support from Elizabeth Linnell.  She
did a splendid job of coordination and had great ideas of implementation.
She kept the group alive.

Our main obstacle, aside from other responsibilities, is that other groups,
specially the eKnow team liked the idea so much that they started calling
everything "knowledge management" or "expert " without a clear idea of all
the implications.

A positive discovery was that throughout Enron there are a number of efforts
that are trying achieve a better situation with respect to information,
communication and knowledge.  Unfortunately many of this groups are not a
priority within their business units.

We have an operational  pilot webpage with some interesting content.

We also drafted two documents.  A first draft of a business plan and a theory
support document with respect to knowledge.

Our last meeting must have been around August and it is my fault that we have
not met again but it has to do with my workload in Mexico.  I hope to
continue with this project by establishing a monthly meeting to arrive to the
full launch of ther program in our area  A.S.A.P or whenever you set the
deadline (2nd quarter 2001?)

I would recommend  implementation but, perhaps due to Elizabeth's and my
responsibilities we would need someone else that devotes more time to the
implementation of this project.

I think it would be important to develop a working group for training within
our area.  They could develop programs, ask for changes in current programs
so that they are also focused to what we do.  Promote the assistance of our
team to different courses, internal and external, etc.

Please call if I can be of assistance.

Best,

Ricardo
