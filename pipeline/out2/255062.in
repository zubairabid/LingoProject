Stan and Jim -
Attached is a draft report to the board regarding the new stds org. Let me
know if this is okay, or if you expected something else.  After I get your
okays and changes, I will send it on to the other task force members for
their thoughts and approvals.  It up front states that we are not asking for
a vote to change the governance at the June meeting.  Thanks,  Rae
