Richard --

Here is the FERC Order on California issues.

Along with this Order, the question has been raised whether or not this Order
effectively tells the CPUC that they have no authority in wholesale matters
and we will not give them the information they are requesting in their
Subpoena?  Maybe we should ask Mike Day and Dan Watkiss for their opinion on
this matter before we do anything else in terms of responding?
