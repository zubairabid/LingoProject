Barbara,
I am not sure whether my response was sent or not yesterday.  My Notes Mail
crashed every time I tried to send an email.  The reason that I suggested
that Entex Gas Marketing and Mercado remain with their affiliated
distribution utility is that transactions with these entities are usually
behind the city gate, transactions usually bounce between the utility and the
marketing entity until a decision is made by the counterparty.  In the past
we have documented transactions as being with the marketing entity and Entex
has requested that they be with the utility, also the reverse has occurred.
However, if the utility will set up different marketing reps to keep the
business straight, then we should be okay with moving the marketing to HPL.
