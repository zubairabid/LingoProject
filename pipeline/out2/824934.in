Pat Dresner (accountant) at Midcon Texas says she does not show these deals
in her system and she can not pay on them.  You created the deals in Sitara
and I don't have another trader's name.  Could you please talk to your KN
trader regarding this situation?  If Midcon really got this gas, then someone
at KN should tell their accountant about the deal.
