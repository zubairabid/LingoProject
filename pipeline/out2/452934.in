Information Management Weekly Milestones Report ) 02/09/01



Portal.
Portal development work continues for respective BU/FUs under Joe Wong's
direction.  This work is based on information collected from portal surveys.
Brandon Rigney's team committed to delivering the portal graphical treatment
by 2/16/01.  A new portal name is being discussed.  The decision for the
portal "look and feel" and the portal name will be made next week.  A
"progress before perfection" approach is planned for releasing the portal.

"Killer" or "sticky" applications for the new portal are being identified and
prioritized.  All task force members are required to identify five "killer"
or "sticky" applications by next week's IM Task Force meeting.

Some features of Hewlitt Packard's benchmark portal are being discussed and
targeted for development.

Tibco 2.0 version targeted as a requirement to provide personalized color
treatments for portal.  Allen Elliott to confirm licensing agreement for
Tibco 2 is in place.

Single sign-on capability will require changes to the producer portal
applications.  The single sign-on security task force has developed and
proposed a strategy to make this happen.  The portal development is working
this issue to ensure the eventual release of a single sign-on entry point for
the portal.

Philippe Bibi was provided a project update.  Philippe re-emphasized the need
to unveil a best practices portal that is simple, wanted by users, and
value-added for users.

UDM/ESE.
Inktomi and Verity appear to be the choice contenders.  Since Autonomy
requires an obtrusive amount of work on individual employees, interview
results predict users would not support this product type.  Consequently, the
task force does not expect to pilot Autonomy.

Business Analyst Paul Timberlake collected high level pricing for each
vendor.  Below is a table of that information.  Paul is working with GSS's
Peter Goebel to gain additional pricing support. Note, Paul's final report
will have extensive licensing information for each vendor.

Vendor	Initial Cost	Annual Support & Maintenance
Autonomy	$3,000,000	$540,000 / year support
Inktomi	$1,375,000	$206,250 / year support
Verity	$682,500
($487,500  +  $162,500 + $32,500)	$130,000 / year support


IM Strategy Proposal.
Steve Kean attended the weekly IM Task Force meeting to get an update on the
IM Strategy Proposal.  Although the task force was suggesting an executive
point person be identified, Steve reminded the task force of the value of
grassroots efforts.  The task force will remain focused on identifying and
developing sticky portal applications to improve the flow of information
which ultimately should increase the flow of revenue.  Steve's message to IM
Task Force:  do what it takes to make it happen.

During the discussion with Steve, the task force reviewed HP's best practices
portal.  Steve would like to view the HP demonstration of their best
practices portal.

The Task Force team met with EES' Knowledge Management team to discuss a ONE
Enron approach to information management.  EES emphasized need for executive
management to encourage BU/FU IM/KM coordination.
