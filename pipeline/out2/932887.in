I was just thinking about the anniversary thing, too.  I bought a book at
Barnes & Noble -- 100 Best Family Resorts in North America.  I found the name
of one place that I have seen in the past in magazines that I always thought
looked good - High Hampton Inn and Country Club in North Carolina.  Another
place that I have seen is something like Blackberry Farm in Tennessee.  Both
meet the criteria of mountains in the Carolina/Tennessee range.  I will get
info on both and we can look at it.  I worry a little bit about having such a
range of ages that I want to make sure that we go someplace where there is
plenty to do for all -- just sitting for some, shopping, eating, golf, etc.
These two places may be on the smaller side and may or may not offer enough
variety.  I thought that I would also get some info on some other places that
may not have popped up on Mom and Dad's list but that might be good for the
whole family.  One of those might catch their interest as well.

I can understand that with prolonged holiday exposure to Mom and Dad that the
thought of this trip could wear thin.  I would like the opportunity to be
together with everyone -- maybe we could send them on a nice dinner just the
two of them and the rest of us could have fun one night!  Even though Dad is
doing so much better, you never know when you will have the chance to get
everyone together on a trip like this.  Memory-maker or nightmare -- could be
a toss up, but maybe worth the try.  Let's share some research and see if
there is any place that we could get excited about going.
