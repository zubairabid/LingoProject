gary, mary, steve,
please prepare a presentation that could be given to the high level people
trying to solve the california problem.
I would like to see an aggressive solution that shows that we have a more
expansive view of how to solve the problem with DSM than ever before thought
of.
I know you have a good start on that, but I would now like you to:

continue to refine the idea (refine might be expand and add implementation
details)
contact steve kean and jeff dasovich for feedback and further refinement
schedule meetings to start reviewing our view and listening to their view
refine again
imlement, implement, implement

Please send me the most current vision and a copy of the implementation
timeline by next Wednesday.
Thanks
