I assume you have heard that EOL is soliciting HoustonStreet.com and
QuickQuote.com in order to
increase their volume and market coverage.  The message below is from Ron
Nolte, our IT person
for the confirmation systems.  I think he is asking some very pertinent
questions that may need your
legal opinion.
I guess my fear is that you have not been included in the conversations and
set-up of EOL's discussions
with HoustonStreet.com and QuickQuote.com.
