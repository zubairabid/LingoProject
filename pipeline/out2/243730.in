Zoom  Tip #1: Choosing  the Right Zoom for Springtime Pictures

Springtime brings  so many photo opportunities: flowers in bloom, children in
Easter  finery, butterflies, bunnies, and egg hunts. To capture the best
moments in pictures, make sure you are zoom-wise! First let''s start  with
the basics.[IMAGE]

Zoom settings  are the focal lengths available to you. They are labeled  and
measured in millimeters (this measurement is actually the distance  between
the lens element and the film). Zoom settings fall into  3 categories: wide
angle (less than 28mm), normal (28mm - 50mm),  and telephoto (above 50mm).
Wide angle settings allow you to capture  a broader scene without physically
moving farther away. Normal settings  let you capture as much as one of your
eyes sees (your angle  of view with both eyes open is approximately 28mm and
about 50mm  with one eye closed). Since a camera has only one eye (lens),
50mm  is considered normal. Telephoto settings soar above 50mm, magnifying
the subject and narrowing the angle of view.

[IMAGE]To  capture fields of springtime flowers or entire yards on film, try
using a setting such as 28mm or 35mm. They will provide a  sweeping view of
spring color. Remember also that early morning  and late afternoon light
intensifies spring hues. Bright  noontime sun is beautiful but will wash out
your photos'' colors  (and cause your subjects to squint). If midday is your
only chance  to snap pictures, then try for a bright, cloudy day!

When photographing  people and animals, it''s best to use low telephoto
settings, such  as 80mm-120mm. These provide accurate facial and body
proportions.  It also helps to keep your camera level with your subject,
rather  than pointing downward or upward. If you''re snapping photos of
small  children this may mean getting down on their level. The telephoto
setting will also allow you to be farther away, and less of a distraction  to
them. After all, the best kid-shots are the spontaneous "un-posed"  ones!




Did  you know  that some Compact Point & Shoot  cameras offer zoom settings
that are as versatile as those found  on SLR lenses? You can capture
spring''s finest moments with these  pocket-sized wonders:

Zoom  Tip #2: Why are my prints blackened  in each of the four corners? Does
it have something to do with my  zoom lens?[IMAGE]

This is called the vignette effect and it''s most commonly  seen in photos
taken with a single lens reflex (SLR) camera. It  occurs when you use the
wrong size lens hood on the front of your  lens while taking a wide-angle
shot. The camera is actually photographing  the edges of the hood. If you
look carefully through your SLR viewfinder,  you should be able to see the
protruding hood before the picture  is taken and correct the problem by
either increasing your zoom  magnification or removing the hood. The vignette
effect also occurs  when too many filters are stacked onto the front of the
lens. Simply  remove the unnecessary filter(s) or increase the zoom. If it''s
too  late and your prints already contain vignette edges, simply ask  your
favorite Wolf Camera photo expert to crop the blackened  areas out!

Zoom  Tip #3: Which  is the better choice, optical or digital zoom?

Zoom is one of the great technological marvels of today''s cameras.
Virtually every camera and camcorder lens sports some level of zoom
capability. But did you know there are two types of zoom? Most of  these
products use an optical zoom system, but some use digital  zoom technology.
So what''s the difference and which is the better  zoom choice?


As  a general rule, optical zoom produces the clearest, sharpest image
results. Optical zoom involves true lens element movement when magnifying  or
widening the subject area. This high quality lens system is found  on
traditional point & shoot cameras, SLR lenses, and is a feature  of most
digital cameras and camcorders. Although the optical magnification  power
isn''t as great as with digital zoom, your digital images,  photographic
prints, and video footage are sharp, clean, and clear.

Digital  zoom, on the other hand, uses a system of computerized enhancement
called interpolation to magnify an image. It''s a common feature  in today''s
camcorders and digital cameras. Digital zoom picks up  where the optical zoom
leaves off, and allows for much greater magnification.  But the trade-off is
in the image quality. Images viewed on a computer  screen aren''t drastically
affected, but printed images and video  footage can suffer a loss of clarity
and detail. With camcorders  especially, steadiness becomes an issue: a
tripod is a must when  using high digital zoom settings.

The  best way to choose a zoom setting is to consider what you wish to  do
with the image. If you plan to produce prints and enlargements,  or if fine
detail is a must, then consider using optical zoom only.  If high zoom power
and monitor-viewing are your priorities, then  try the digital zoom feature!
