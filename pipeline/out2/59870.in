We executed final documentation on sale of the Noram rig for $9 million ($4.4 million net to Enron).  Although the purchaser has until April 13th to fund, there are no contingencies in the contract and SCF Partners controls the entity.  The delay in funding is required since there is a 21-day period for them to make their capital calls.

A number of things came together for us this week, which is good.

The week is now over.
