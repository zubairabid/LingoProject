Bryan,

I talked to Vasant about the model review in London. He thought that he could
accomplish this from Houston,
but I think direct  communication makes things much easier. I think his trip
to London
makes a lot of sense. KMV confirmed the meeting on the 20th. We hope to get
more information about
the scope of their model and assess its the applicability to your business.
Vasant, after a few days of immersion in your operations, will be able to
assess better the usefulness of the
model.
