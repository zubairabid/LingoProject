hey- just checked- JJW playing at gruene hall fri dec 15th- his sat show is
sold out.  any interest or poss. that you could leave work around 3-4 and
go?  just emailed katy about going up earlier and shopping which i know you
prob couldn't do, but could be a fun girls' nite out in NB.  kind of have to
jump on this asap b/c tix are going to sell out soon!  if you can email me
back in next 5 mins, do so, if not try to give me a quick call later- am
jogging home from the internet store, so should be home in about 45 mins!
hope all is well- and hope SINCERELY that the f*%o'n morons in florida get
swallowed up by a giant tidal wave.  IF YOU CAN'T READ A DAMN BALLOT, DON'T
VOTE!  and you DEFINITELY shouldn't be able to vote if you're shameless
enough to speak out PUBLICALLY and admit you CAN'T read a ballot....!
aughhhhhhh!  just one more bit of evidence that supports my theory that all
voters should take an IQ test, and then have their vote weighed
appropriately......
