FYI:  All Commercial Support is provided under my direction for EIM.  I
report into Sally Beck.

I will not be able to provide you any dates at this time.  We received some
information on Monday (1/22), and there initiatives underway today to meet
with MetalsUSA to look at their inventory reporting and tracking systems.
After that information is gathered and evaluated, we will be better informed
as to next steps.   Most likely, all support efforts will be manual (as most
of EIM's currently are) until we can learn more about the operation as well
as develop the functionality.  I suggest we talk on Friday, Monday at the

Mike Moscoso is the business Controller responsible for Steel and Martha
Stevens is the Risk Manager responsible for the Risk books.  Del Davis is
overseeing the Logistics aspects of the deal.  Mike and I have discussed
having a dedicated account manager for the account, probably a Sr.
Specialist.  We have not made a decision yet.  Additionally, Richard
Burchfield from IT is helping us with the system evaluation.

We have the same Control concerns you have, and will work with you as we
develop the systems and processes.  We currently have a large initiative in
place, utilizing PriceWaterhouseCoopers and Arthur Andersen, to develop a
road map for EIM's infrastructure which includes processes, people and system
recommendations.  This initiative has been underway since December, and is
expected to be completed byt the end of 02/01.  I'd be more than happy to
share this with Credit.  Just let me know.
