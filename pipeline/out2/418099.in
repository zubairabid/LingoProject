On the first point the reference to a "municipal plant" did not disclose
whether it was a legal body corporate. That fine if the check has been made.
As far as the US$6m  min asset level is concerned it does not specifically
relate to Australia counterparties (ie those  incorporated in Australia). It
relates to companies with whom we trade Australian power irrespective of
place of incorporation. Under our power trading licence requirements we are
required to take reasonable steps to satisfy ourselves that we are dealing
with non-retail type investors. There is a check list in the licence of
requirements , the most relevant for companies not trading in Australia is
the AUD10m (US$6m) in "tangible assets".
Tana thank you for your offer. You are really doing an excellent job pulling
together a huge amount of information in such an effective. I am loath to do
anything that would make your job any more difficult. I think we can assume
that a party which has sufficient assets to trade US power can also trade
Australian power. As far as Australian incorporated companies are concerned
we will be checking their suitability Australian power hopefully at the time
we receive the password application. If not I will pick it up when I check
your list.
