Attached is the final presentation for inclusion in DealBench.

Dave, we made a small change in the order of the presentation.  We swithched
the next to last sections so Other Acquisition Issues is before California
Power Market.  Also, the Labor Agreement slide has change based on my
conversation with Rick Johnson.

Sam and Dave, if you have notes you will follow, please forward them to
Sheila and Karen to assist them in their review of your voice-over.

Please call if you have any questions or comments.
