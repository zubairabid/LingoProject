Stan -
Please see the attached email which summarizes our last strawman conference
call.  I wanted to point out where each of the participants was coming from
by separate email.  Hugh Roberts and Alan Knoop, who were attending a
producer meeting were adamantly opposed to the models offered by both Greg
Lander and Jim Templeton.  They did not want any structure which would
diminish their rights and took the position that both were non-starters.
The same was also true of Mike Novak who spoke for the LDC's.  Hugh offered
a third model which kept both gas and electric essentially separate with
what he termed a "Energy Standards Advisory Communication Liaison" as the
interface between GISB and EISB (Electric Industry Standards Board).  My
concern was this did not go far enough to assure that cross industry issues
would be addressed.  To bridge the gap, we elevated the bridge to an
"Executive Committee" level with representation from both gas and electric
with a charter to review only those issues which cut across both industries.
Personally, I view this as an evolutionary process to get all segments
comfortable with the mechanics of dealing with cross industry issues.  If we
push for a combined Board, the votes from the Producers and LDC's are not
there.  Maybe the "EC level" is a good start.  We have another conference
call this Thursday.  I would appreciate your thoughts/reaction to this
hybrid strawman recognizing that we have not discussed any details.  Pending
the outcome of this weeks call with Jim, Greg and Rae hopefully in
attendance I will let you know where things stand.  If we are still on this
track after the call, I would like to have a follow up conference call with
the Pipeline segment to get everyone up to speed.
