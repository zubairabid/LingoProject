Hi Vince and Molly.
Here attached is one candidate who is particularly interested in having his
profile sent to Vince...he is going to be traveling to NY from the UK soon
for 2 wks.
He specifically asked my partner at RobertWalters in the UK to investigate
Enron through my new relationship with you guys. He would be Howard Haughton,
attached below (CV).

The other 2 resumes are my students at the University of Michigan. Howard Lin
received a 4.0/4.0 for his last term and will be willing to do whatever it
takes to intern at Enron for June- Aug. I have his picture included as well.
The second is Sung, they are friends. Howy will be done expected in May 2001
and Sung in May 2002. They are my favorite interns and I expect they can be
cultivated to the Enron culture with no real cost to you (a "test drive
before committal. I have agreed to represent them and
shall take ownership, as they become graduate candidates upon their degree
completion.

I hope these attachment can represent my value and commitment to quality of
talent to Enron.

Thank you for your acceptance.
Best wishes for the weekend.
Jeff
