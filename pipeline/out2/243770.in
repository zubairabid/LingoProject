Here we go again.  I guess it hasn't dawned on them that if we do separate
invoicing for March, we'll still have M-L credit risk until the invoice is
paid in April, so we're not going to be interested in letting go of their
collateral.........   What do we usually do w/ this?  Do we need to talk to
someone in Settlements?  Please let me know so we can work out this detail
for them.............
Regards,
Janice
