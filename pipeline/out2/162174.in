I understand that we may have no choice in the matter, but

having wtinessed Loretta Lynch's inability to define market power when asked
to do so by Joe Barton last Monday, and,
having heard Carl Wood declare war on capitalism at FERC's hearing on
Tuesday, and,
knowing that the likes of Harvey Morse (PUC FERC attorney), who has never
come down on the side of "no market power here" in any analysis, is "heading
up" the PUC investigation, and
seeing Gov Davis' press releases demanding refunds from the faceless,
out-of-state suppliers

I'm, well, maybe a little nervous about them getting their paws on our data.
