Hi Heather,

The confidentiality agreement signed by Enron/Vepco states as follows:

Except as required by law, neither party hereto nor their representatives
will disclose to any person either the fact that discussions or negotiations
are taking place between them not any terms, conditions or other fact with
respect to any transaction that may be proposed or undertaken, including the
status thereof.

-------------------------------------------------------------

We can loosen up the terms in the contract so that we can disclose certain
terms to potential investors (I'll make that change), or we can discuss
amending this agreement.  Additionally, it looks like we have the testimony
and application filed with the Public Staff to work with.
