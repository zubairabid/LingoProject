CES has decided to take 600 dth/day of their Texas Gas Zone 4 length into
CGAS at Lebanon for the 24th-29th.  To keep the deal tickets simple, I am
showing a purchase from CES at Lebanon for 600 dth/day at the first of the
month CGAS price.
Joe, I created a purchase from CES (deal 202576).  Match this up with 600dth
of deal 159319.
We will effectively be using 600 dth less of Dayton space for CES starting on
the 24th.
I will let you know if things change.
