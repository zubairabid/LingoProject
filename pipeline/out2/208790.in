Remember how much fun (and easy!) it was to ride a bike as a kid?  Have you
ever considered joining Team Enron to ride your bicycle from Houston to
Austin in support of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society?

If the answer is "yes" to either of these questions, don't delay!  Make plans
to attend the "Never Ever" Workshop, hosted by the Enron Cycling Club, from
9:00 am to 10:00 am on Tuesday, January 23rd, in EB5C2.  Take advantage of
the opportunity to ask general and detailed questions about training rides,
cycling equipment, signing-up, pledging and the entire experience.

Saying to yourself "I can't ride my bike five miles much less 150..." then
seriously reconsider!  You only need to ride 300 miles total before the MS150
to get used to being on your bike.  Can't ride during the week?  No problem!
This training goal can be accomplish by simply training on Saturday mornings
during the 15 weekends between now and then.   Come to the workshop and learn
more!

Now... close your eyes... think about enjoying the view over your handlebars
of the early sun creeping higher in the horizon... the sound of your wheels
spinning easily beneath you....  breathing in the fresh air and making a
change...  a change for yourself and an opportunity to impact someone with
MS.  Here's the perfect chance to make new friends and start something new.

Last year, Team Enron raised over $500,000 and was the #1 fund-raiser in the
entire country - learn how to be part of this fabulous team and take
advantage of Enron's Matching Gifts Program!  For more information, contact
Charla Reese (x35202) or Kelly Strader (x30500).  Click here to visit the
