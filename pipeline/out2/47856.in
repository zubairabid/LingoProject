When El Paso gets exercised for replacement  reserves by the CAISO and they
play the 10 minute ramping games.  Don't call EPE to ramp down their
generation, if possible run an imbalance and receive the dec prices.  I have
cleared this with EPE and John Forney.  If something happens to change this
situation drop me a line.
