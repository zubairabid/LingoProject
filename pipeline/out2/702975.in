<<Book2.xls>> Kim. This is a view of a gas customer in our service
territory. Forecasted load over the next ten years, to the nearest thousand
MMBTU.  Let me know how you like to quote something like this. (To the
nearest thousand or five thousand.)  I want to give these guys full
requirements contract to their meter with a take or pay amount with whatever
imbalance met at spot index prices.  I am leaning toward using the low
forecast (thinking gas prices may go down in the long term.)  How would you
like to proceed on this?  Mike.

P.S. I only gave you the other forecasts in case you thought it would be a
good idea to go another way.  They are for information, not action.
