Sandy,
Attached are the tickets we intend to submit to document the two (2) deals
with Cabot for December.  Once you and John have had an opportunity to review
these tickets, Melissa and I would like to come down and walk them through
the system.  Thanks.
Cabot has agreed to do the December deals at index minus $0.01 for 80% of
their volume and gas daily minus $0.01 for the remaining 20% of their
volume.  We expect that they will soon execute the long term paper providing
for index minus $0.005 for the 80% firm traunch and gas daily minus $0.005
for the 20% spot traunch; a set of new long term tickets will be prepared and
submitted upon execution of the long term paper.
If this mechanism of documenting our deals works, we intend to submit all
future deals in a similar manner.
