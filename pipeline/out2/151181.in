Gerald,

Here's Hanover's letter.  A big concern of mine going into this meeting is
knowing Brian's and Al Lavenue's frame of mind at this point , we are going
to leave at an impasse.  Several scenarios shake out of that:   1) legal
action by Hanover against us   2) Hanover pulls their machines or just shuts
them down which in either case I would assume we are exposed to legal
recourse from our customers  3) all the above plus acreage dedicated to us is
released and we are out of the Powder.  Lets discuss ASAP.  Thanks

Ken
