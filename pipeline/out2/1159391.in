More than half of the outstanding assignments are purchase contracts with no
delivery exposure as well.  I agreed with Chip Hollands to reduce the gty by
100MM.  I believe the original was 275MM, with 50MM-75MM allocated to the
indemnity?  He will have their attorneys contact you with the amendment.
Once Bryce completes  his valuation, we will be able to determine if further
reductions are possible.  Please call if you have questions.
