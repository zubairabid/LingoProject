Harvard Business School is doing a 5-year business case study on Enron.
Below  is the information that I have regarding their visit.   The name of
the case study is Modern Giants (attached below)

(They are interested in developing a clearer picture of the architecture and
design of Enron,s organization, products, and services--how the company and
its key businesses have been put together and how they work on a daily,
quarterly, and annual basis.)
