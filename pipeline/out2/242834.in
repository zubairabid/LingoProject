Sara -
Jeff Fuller is interested in pursuing ISDA's with a number of his other
customers after a successful experience with Merced Irrigation District.  He
would like a generic ISDA to start with and hopes to negotiate four ISDA's in
the near future.  The purpose of the ISDA will be to hedge their price risk
once they get a piece of slice (this is a BPA plan to allocate slices of
their system to customers).  Feel free to call me if you have any questions
at 503-464-3810.
