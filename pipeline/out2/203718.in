News : FERC Approves Independence, SupplyLink Projects
2:00 PM (CST) Jul 12, 2000

After submitting proof of market need in the form of newly signed precedent
agreements
for firm transportation capacity, the highly contested Independence Pipeline
and related
SupplyLink pipeline projects were approved by FERC this morning. The two
projects
have been pending at FERC for more than three years.

The FERC decision paves the way for more than 900 MMcf/d of new natural gas
transportation capacity to be built between Chicago and the Leidy Hub in
Pennsylvania.
The "tentative" in-service date for the projects is November 2002. Their
downstream
partner, MarketLink, which was approved by FERC in April, is expected to be
operating
a year earlier, a Williams Cos. spokesman said.  Williams, Coastal, and
National
Fuel are sponsoring the three pipeline projects, which together represent an
investment
of about $1.5 billion.

The Commission approved the "greenfield" Independence project over
significant
opposition from landowners in Ohio and Pennsylvania, who recently said they
were not
convinced the new precedent agreements provided "sufficient evidence" of
market
support .  The agreements met FERC's requirement for the projects to have at
least 35%
of their total capacity subscribed by non-affiliates by June 26.
