Tana, I am attempting to put together a "spark spread" with Energy West
Resources (AKA Energy West).  EPMI has a master in place with Energy West
Resources Inc. their current and correct business name.   I understand we
have an ISDA in place with Energy West Incorporated who is one and the
same.   In addition to credit concerns, is there any problem doing a
financial transaction with Energy West Resources Inc. under the name on the
ISDA of Energy West Incorporated ?
