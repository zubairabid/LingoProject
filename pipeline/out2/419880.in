Unfortunately Euromoney is no longer offering their courses.  They were by
far the best around and it's a real shame.  There is a PLI course being
offered in NY in mid November (at which I'm speaking on commodity
derivatives) and ISDA has a conference in London on collateral arrangements
and the ISDA Credit Support Documents.  Neither is anywhere near as good as
the old Euromoney courses but both would probably benefit Jane.
