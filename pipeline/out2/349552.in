Attached are the BGE filings at the US District Court in Baltimore.  They are
seeking injunctive and declaratory relief, both of which were summarily
rejected by Judge Matsch in Denver, who is treating CSU's claim as an APA
review. They are also making virtually identical legal claims as CSU - their
central claim is that they have the exclusive right to operate electric and
gas systems inside Fort Meade. BGE has also brought in the issue of state
jurisdiction over other entities such as EFSI:  they cite an opinion letter
from the General Counsel of the MD PSC as an "official decision"  - which it
is not.  In any case, Randy Rich and I had  subsequent meeting with GC
regarding that letter in which she "clarified" her position in various
respects contrary to BGE's claims.  But I see that aspect of BGE's complaint
as favorable from our standpoint - the District Court can rule on this issue
instead of the state courts.  Vicki/Andrew, please let me know how you want
to proceed.  I have a few ideas that we could discuss with whomever handles
the case as outside counsel.    -Bob 3-3180
