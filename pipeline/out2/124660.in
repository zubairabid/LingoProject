Dan--

While you were out of the office, Wellstar called with some (last minute)
changes; all were relatively minor.  I took the liberty of redlining their
proposed changes for your review and revision.  Let's discuss the attached
docs, (if necessary), then I'll send Wellstar final copies upon your approval.

Thanks!

Dan

P.S.  I have changes to discuss from Coleman and Yates...(a lot from Yates)
