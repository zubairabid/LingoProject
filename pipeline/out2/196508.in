Greg,

Yes, I am their guy.  I have extensive info and feedback forms on them.  We
definitely need to talk.  Please set up a 30 minute meeting with Cathy 36898
and we can go through it and i;ll give you a copy of all info.

Thanks,
mike

PS congrats on ClickPaper.  The site looks great, you and your group
accomplished a lot in a short period of time.  I know that the big test day
was yesterday and hope all went well.
