Jim,

Thanks for your assistance.  As we discussed, all we need is our engineering
department to sign off on LCRA's measurement specs which are attached below
in Exhibit "B".  I spoke withTom Fry today and he suggested that Sam Shaw at
Hanover is the one to review the specs and make sure they match ours.  Please
contact me as soon as possible once we have confirmation on the specs.  LCRA
is eager to sign as they are quickly approaching their commencement of
construction date.  The documents are ready for execution as soon as we get a
"go-ahead" on the measurement specs.  Thanks Again.
