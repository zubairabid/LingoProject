Jim, I agree - lets put a plan in place to ensure appropriate representation
at these ISO's (not unlike PAC) and ensure that FERC is not abdicating their
responsibilities.
The three of us probably need to get together and discuss tactics around a
number of issues.
Jim, I am also curious where you are in your thoughts and plans given your
new role.
