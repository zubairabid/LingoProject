Marcia,

Thank you for your e-mail regarding SP's to the purposed GISB.  My responses
are as follows:

Section 1.   We will agree to your suggest  language.

Netting:  We suggest the following:

In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in the
same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through
netting,  in which case the party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount
shall pay to the other party the difference between the amounts owed.

Adequate Assurance:   We will agree to 5 business days.

Term:  For firm delivery limit the use of the GISB to 30 days.  For
interruptible delivery there is no limit.

We  will agree to the above along with our other SP's as written.  Thanks for
your attention to the foregoing.  Please let me have your thoughts.

Regards,
