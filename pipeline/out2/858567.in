Hi Folks,



Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.

Passing Game  Matchups. Here's how I see the matchups this  week. Please
note, see the  cheatsheet onlinehttp://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start. Just because
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup. The matchup info  is meant
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between
players.

Note: I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/for
more info.

Here we go:

Locks: These games heavily favor the Offense

Seattle Passing  Game vs Bronco Defense  If we,ve seen one  trend recently
in defenses it,s to start your QB / WR / TEs against the Broncos  and worry
about your RBs. They,re  tough on the running game but easy against the
pass. I won,t get into whether that,s a  &chicken or the egg8 situation but
the bottom line is go with your passing guys  against Denver. They rank # 31
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. QB Jon Kitna
gets another start  and while I have a hard time putting too much faith in
him, he,s been ok. Derrick  Mayesand  Sean  Dawkinsshould see lots  of
action and rookie Darrell  Jacksonis working his  way back into the mix. If
you,ve  been sitting on RB Shaun  Alexander, coach Mike  Holmgren did say he
wanted to see more of Alexander in passing downs but I,m  still not too
excited about him yet.

Tennessee Passing  Game vs Bengal Defense Once again, keep an eye on  QB
Steve  McNair,shealth this  week. It,s early, but he,s already  being called
a game time decision as he tries to recover from knee and ankle  injuries.
Keep your fingers crossed  as it,s a tasty matchup vs the weak Bengal pass
defense. They rank # 30 in passing yards allowed  per game over the last
month and are just playing out the season. Cornerback Rodney Heath is lost
for the  year with a bad shoulder and that should make things even easier.
Derrick  Masonis the clear cut  # 1 WR with Chris  Sanders# 2. The best
receiver on the team (or at  least most utilized) is TE Frank  Wycheckwho,s
starting to  get back to his normal high level of  production.

Denver Passing  Game vs Seahawk Defense By now you know the  drill: Start
any player vs  Seattle. Just do it. The Seahawks are anemic. QB Brian
Griese did start to throw some  but he,s still at least a couple weeks away,
maybe more. Gus  Frerottegets another  start and if you,re looking for him
to regain that 400+ yard form he showed  early on, this is his best chance to
do it. Rod Smithand  Ed  McCaffreyare the usual  must starts at WR.  Dwayne
Carswelland  Desmond  Clarkare excellent  plays at TE. I,d start either
one  and feel pretty good about it, especially  Carswell.

Baltimore Passing  Game vs Charger Defense San Diego made a run back at
respectability on defense but I,m thinking they,ve fallen back down to well
below average. Over the last four  weeks, they rank # 27 in passing yards
allowed per game. For the year, they rank # 28 in Fantasy  Points allowed to
the opposing QB.  The Ravens come back after a bye week off and should be
ready to  roll. QB Trent  Dilferis playing  exceptionally well and WRs
Qadry  Ismailand  Patrick  Johnsoncould do  well. The most enticing matchup
may  be Shannon  Sharpeas San Diego  ranks just 24th in Fantasy Points
allowed to the opposing TE for the  year.

St. Louis Passing  Game vs Viking Defense I don,t think you keep  QB Kurt
Warnerdown for  long. Sure, he had an awful game  last week but some of that
can be blamed on the WRs who I bet you don,t see drop  half of what Warner
throws this time.  The Vikings still give up lots of passing yards ranking #
26 in passing  yards allowed per game over the last month. For the year,
they rank # 24 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB.  Isaac Bruce
is the best WR  while Torry Holthas been  surprisingly disappointing lately.
He,s still worth a start though.  Az-Zahir  Hakimalways has a  chance too.
The Vikings just don,t  have the secondary to keep up with these  guys.



Prime Matchups: These games favor the  Offense

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Colt Defense I probably get more mail from my
ripping Rob Johnson than I do for any other player. I make no apologies as I
really just  don,t like the guy. He simply has  major troubles finishing a
game.  Although he draws a great matchup this week against Indy, one of the
weaker defenses in the league.  Safety Chad Cota has a concussion and is
questionable so they might be  even less effective. On the other  hand, the
Colts definitely seem to up the intensity at home. As you can see from my
rankings, I,m not  thinking too much of Johnson again this week, but he does
have a good  matchup. Eric Moulds is the  primary WR as always with Peerless
Price and Jeremy McDonald  picking up the scraps. TE Jay  Reimersma is a
favorite target and gets plenty of looks.

Pittsburgh  Passing Game vs Giants Defense The Kordell Stewart  Bandwagon
is getting awfully crowded lately, but for good reason. He,s playing very
solid football. More importantly, he cleared a huge  hurdle Sunday showing
some leadership and toughness coming back in the game  after injuring his
leg. The Giants  defense is very beatable but do understand coach Jim
Fassell,s media games where  he says &ok8 more than Joe Pesci in Lethal
Weapon are apparently working as his  playoff guarantee seems to have
inspired the team. The pass defense still ranks # 25  in passing yards
allowed  per game over the last month though. For the year, they rank # 23
in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing QB. Hines Ward is the WR of
choice on  this team and I,d feel fine starting him. He,s not even the true #
2 guy, but  you could do worse then taking a reach on Bobby Shaw. For some
reason, I like him over starter  Courtney Hawkins. Even TE Mark Bruener is a
solid choice as he,s  done more in the last two weeks than he,s done in two
years.

Kansas City  Passing Game vs Panthers Defense I,m  dreading the Gunther
Cunningham firing as he may make Dick Vermiel look like  Iron Mike. A solid
game here could  help him keep his job (which may have Chief fans pulling for
Carolina() From a FF perspective, I like Elvis  Grbac here. He showed
Monday  night he was clearly back from the finger troubles. As usual, the
running game is a mess but  that,s good news for Elvis owners as he,s forced
to go with what,s been working  for them ) throwing the ball. TE  Tony
Gonzalez is having the incredible season we all predicted for him and  he,s
certainly the best receiver on the team. Derrick Alexander is a sure
starter too. Sylvester  Morris continues to regress which is troubling.
Carolina ranks just # 24 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last
four games although for the year, they,ve  fared better ranking # 9 in
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing QB. Part  of that is they seem to
give up a lot of yards without yielding the TD so be  leery in TD only
leagues.

Carolina  Passing Game vs Chief Defense If you,ve been fence sitting with
Steve Beuerlein, this may be a week to take a close look at him. The Chiefs
rank # 21 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and
they may be missing CB James  Hasty who,s questionable with a knee.  WR
Muhsin Muhammad is playing like a man possessed lately and he,s  a sure
starter. Donald Hayes  got through last week,s game without reinjuring his
groin and he,s a solid  option as well. TE Kris  Mangum is no Wesley Walls
but he,s a pretty good player. The Chiefs do get back home where  they,re
tougher but I like this matchup.

San  Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense  The 49er pass defense is
better than people think and the Saints defense  is worse than many assume.
Over the  last four games New Orleans ranks # 20 in passing yards allowed
per  game. (the 49ers  rank # 16) In reality, both  defenses are pretty
suspect. And  both teams feature QBs who will be winging the ball. Jeff
Garcia picked up right where  he left off last week against a tough San Diego
defense. It was great news for Terrell  Owens fans as he looks on his way
back. In the meantime, Jerry Rice  showed he still has a few tricks in the
bag. I wouldn,t be surprised to see Tai  Streets and J.J. Stokes see
increased time at Rice,s expense though  as many feel the Hall of Famer isn,t
in the 49er,s plans for 2001. RB Charlie Garner is always a threat  catching
the ball. TE Greg  Clark is suddenly a producer so he,s worth a shot too.
This could be a  shootout.

Jacksonville  Passing Game vs Cardinal Defense  Two teams heading for the
couch in the post season but that,s about all  they have in common.
Jacksonville  just ran out of time as they,re playing well now. Arizona is
heading downhill from an  already low position. Arizona ranks  # 19 over the
last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game. QB Mark  Brunell had an
injury to his non throwing shoulder but appears to be  fine. He could be a
decent play  along with WRs Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell. Arizona CB
Aneaes Williams is a player  but he can,t do it all. The biggest  problem
for the Jaguar passing game is talking coach Tom Coughlin into calling
something besides a Fred Taylor run which will likely result in a 7 yard
gain  each time(

Minnesota  Passing Game vs Ram Defense You don,t need any analysis from  me
to know you,d better start Daunte Culpepper, Cris Carter and Randy  Moss.
The Rams are much  improved on pass defense where over the last four weeks,
they rank # 17  in passing yards allowed  per game. Still  though, the
Minnesota &Big 38 (&Big 48 counting RB Robert Smith) are no  brainers.

New Orleans  Passing Game vs 49er Defense QB Aaron Brooks  continues to be
one of the better stories of this season. He,s facing a 49er time that,ll be
chock  full of youngsters although they,re playing better of late ranking #
16  in passing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks. But that
was before losing Safety Lance  Shulters to a torn ACL last week.  Brooks
will have Joe Horn catching the ball and Horn should  continue to shine.
Willie  Jackson is a solid # 2 WR and TE Andrew Glover has come alive
lately.



Even Matchups: These games  feature no real advantage either way

Detroit  Passing Game vs Packer Defense Of course, all this hinges on the
ribs of one Charlie Batch.  If he can,t go, all bets are off.  In fact,
even if he can go, you should hedge your bets a bit as we,ve  already seen
one good shot to the chest can mean taking a seat for Batch. It,s not a bad
matchup though against a  Green Bay defense that,s ranked # 22 in passing
yards allowed per  game. Johnnie  Morton is likely the top choice at WR with
Herman Moore in the mix  too. Germane Crowell may be  able to make his
return this week as he,s been practicing this week. I wouldn,t start him yet
but keep an eye  out as might pay dividends for astute owners who scoop him
up. I can see plenty of James Stewart in  this one though as the weather
could be really nasty for this  one.

Chicago  Passing Game vs Patriot Defense This one,s full of story lines as
a healthy Cade McNown remains on the bench this week in favor of Shane
Matthews. The juicy rumor here  is that according to a story in the Sun
Times, McNown would receive a $8.25  million escalator clause if he plays in
55% of the offensive snaps this year and  next. He,s currently at 54%(
Conspiracies aside, Matthews will be  without WR Marcus Robinson who,s out
for the year with a bulging disk in  his back. New England ranks # 23  over
the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per  game but the turmoil could
take it,s toll on the Bears. The Bears will also be without Offensive
Coordinator Gary Crowton who took the BYU job. Some think that will be a
positive. I honestly have a hard time  getting too excited about Eddie
Kennison and Marty  Booker.

Dallas  Passing Game vs Redskin Defense I,m really interested to see how
the  team responds to new coach Terry Robiskie.  I,ll be surprised if they
don,t kick things up several notches. Although I do find it odd that the
guy  in charge of the worst performing part of the team (passing game) is the
guy  they decided to elevate to head coach.  Who knows? QB Troy  Aikman
will try to get through another game without being maimed. He,ll have James
McKnight and  Wayne McGarity to throw to but neither guy looks too promising
against a  pretty tough defense. Dallas showed  last week the complete lack
of faith they have in Aikman when they kept feeding  Emmitt Smith the ball as
they trailed Tampa by a mile. David LaFluer and Jackie  Harris both are
dropping along with Aikman.

Philadelphia  Passing Game vs Brown Defense Two teams used to bringing up
the  rear lately meet with one soaring and the other limping. QB Donovan
McNabb finds himself  in a strange spot here. The Browns  are so pitiful
against the rush that most teams choose to rush the ball on them  at the
expense of throwing it. But  with McNabb the team,s best rusher, he,ll have
to decide which way he,s going to  beat the Browns. Charles Johnson  and
Torrance Small aren,t much.  TE Chad Lewis is the best receiver and he could
make some  noise. I'm interested to see how quickly they work in newly
signed  RB Chris Warren.

Miami  Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense  Another good case of
misconceptions. Miami is better throwing the ball than  people give them
credit for and the Bucs aren,t as dominant stopping the pass  like many
think. Over the last four  weeks, Tampa ranks # 14 in passing yards allowed
per  game. Very solid  for sure, but not dominating.  Jay Fiedler continues
to astound his critics as he threw for 3 TDs  Sunday. I don,t think you,ll
see  the same production here but he,s still a decent play. Leslie Shepherd
had been my  favorite WR here but with his surgery, it looks like Tony Martin
will  finally get a start. Oronde  Gadsden continues to make sick catches.



Downside Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Cleveland Passing  Game vs Eagle Defense This is where Doug Pederson,s at:
He gets the start this week because  rookie Spergon Wynn can,t go due to
injury( WR Kevin Johnson is running the  scout team in practice. Against
the  tough Eagles secondary, he likely will have trouble no matter where he
lines  up. I don,t look for much here from  any of these guys.

Cincinnati Passing  Game vs Titan Defense The Bengals just won,t die
quietly. Corey Dillon keeps running  the ball like a mad bull and QB Scott
Mitchellseems intent on  proving to folks he really can play at this level.
He may be able to but he draws a tough  matchup Sunday in a Titan team that,s
solid. They rank # 11 over the last four week  in passing yards allowed per
game.  Although they may catch break as CB Samari Rolle is nursing a bad
wrist  and will likely have to play with a brace.  WR  Peter Warrickwill
reportedly  have his contact lenses Thursday and that could make a
difference. He,s often worth a roll of the dice for  the start as he has the
big play  potential.

New York Giant  Passing Game vs Steeler Defense The Steelers seemed to
enjoy the  spoiler role last week against Oakland and they get another shot
this week  against the Giants. Pittsburgh,s  playing tough pass defense now
as they rank # 10 in passing yards allowed per  game over the last four
games.  Kerry  Collinsis steady but not  exciting. He,ll be throwing to
WRs Amani  Toomerand  Joe  Jureviciusas it looks like  Ike Hilliard may not
be fully ready yet this week. Keep an eye on that one though. TE Pete
Mitchellhasn,t been  nearly the factor we,d thought he,d be.

Oakland Passing  Game vs Jets Defense The Raiders look to bounce back  this
week and you can bet they do a better job keeping up with the down and
distance. The Jets are playing  tough defense of late ranking # 9 in passing
yards allowed per game over the  last four weeks. Still though,  QB Rich
Gannonis a pretty much  sure starter unless you,re loaded at QB.  Same thing
with WR Tim  Brown. You might roll the dice on  Andre  Risonor  James
Jettbut Brown is the  man. TE Ricky Dudley  is likely worth a  start just on
potential but he,s incredibly frustrating. (like I needed to tell  the Dudley
owners THAT()

Green Bay Passing  Game vs Lion Defense Not only must the Lions defense
hit the field without star CB Bryant Westbrook, they also have to face  Brett
Favrein the cold  weather where he,s invincible.  Check the weather
conditions for this one as it could be more than just  cold. He,s good when
it,s freezing  outside but trying to throw the ball in a driving snowstorm is
an entirely  different matter. Favre will be  throwing to WR Bill Schroeder
who I think is the  better WR choice over mega bucks Antonio  Freeman. TE
Bubba  Franksis always worth a  look. RB Ahman  Greenis a nice  surprise and
he,s catching the ball well.

New York Jets Passing  Game vs Raider Defense  Two teams that,ll see  what
they,re made of square off in a Sunday Night matchup. The Raiders are tough
against the pass  ranking # 7 in passing yards allowed per game over the last
four weeks. QB Vinny  Testeverdeseems to have  finally gotten himself
untracked.  WR Wayne Chrebetmay be handled by Charles Woodson but that
leaves  Dedric Wardand  Windrell Hayesfor  WRs. They,ll be fine. FB Richie
Andersonquietly racks up receiving totals and he could have  a good day again
this week.  TE Anthony Becht continues to play well and is really coming
along.

New England  Passing Game vs Chicago Defense Star QBs on the bench(
Coaches  leaving( What,s a player to think?  If you,re a defensive player
for the Bears, you,re thinking you,d better  go out and prove some people
wrong that think you,re finished. Chicago plays tough pass defense ranking
# 6 in passing yards allowed per game over the last four week. QB Drew
Bledsoe  will look for  WR Terry  Glennand the suddenly  red hot Troy Brown.
TEs Rod  Rutledgeand  Jermaine  Wigginshold down the TE  spot. I hope
Shockmain Davis gets a  TD as I love to write his name(

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Bills Defense QB Peyton  Manningis still a
starter in most leagues but you should know he,s facing a tough matchup this
week. He struggled a bit last time these teams met with a season low 187
yards  passing (although he did have 2 TDs)  Marvin  Harrisonis of course
the  clear cut # 1 Guy. It looks like  Terrence  Wilkinsis finally  breaking
out of his slump and could be a contributor again. Both TEs Ken Dilgerand
Marcus  Pollardhaven,t played up  to their potential of late. Even  with the
bad game last week against Miami, the Bills still rank # 5 over the  last
four week in passing yards allowed per game.



Defensive Slam Dunks: These games heavily favor the  Defense

Tampa Bay Passing  Game vs Miami Defense  Don,t start your  passing game
guys against the Dolphins.  CBs Sam Madison and Patrick Surtain just shut
people down. Especially a QB like Shaun King who,s  not 100% healthy in
addition to being just an adequate QB. Keyshawn Johnson is almost always
worth  a start just for the showmanship but I,m not excited about Tampa
throwing the  ball here.

Washington Passing  Game vs Cowboy Defense Brad  Johnson,sprobably taken
his last snap as a Redskin, especially after he suggested he,d done so. That
means big armed  Jeff  Georgetakes the  helm. He,ll likely face a  Cowboy
defense that,s tough against the pass for one simple reason: they,re awful
defending the run and  teams just choose to run all over them.  Look for
Stephen Davis  to wear it  out. When George does throw, I  think James
Thrashis the best  option.  Albert  Connellwill likely start  but Thrash
makes plenty of plays.  TE  Stephen Alexanderis probably worth  a shot as is
pass catching FB Larry  Centers.

San Diego Passing  Game vs Raven Defense Ryan Leafand company get  the
&honor8 of facing the # 3 ranked defense over the past 4 weeks in passing
yards allowed per game. It should  be interesting. Leaf will be  throwing
to TE Freddie  Jonesand  WR Curtis  Conway. Jeff Graham  suffered a mouth
injury last week and may need dental surgery. It,s probably just as well as
this  matchup is looking very sketchy for  Leaf.
Arizona  Passing Game vs Jaguar Defense This could get ugly all  around.
Jacksonville ranks # 4 over  the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per
game. And Arizona,s Jake  Plummeris nursing bad ribs. We saw with  Charlie
Batch last week that it,s hard for a team to keep a QB in the game if  he,s
got injured ribs. David  Bostonis playing well lately and Frank  Sanders has
been awful. I,m not excited about  any of them for this week.
