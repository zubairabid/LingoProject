Kim,
I received the documents late yesterday.  I am in the process of comparing
the hard copy to the marked up version we have been working with.  Once I
finish, I will forward the two originals of the guaranty document to Enron
Corp for their review and execution.  Once I receive it back, I will let you
know.  I will forward two copies of the contract document to the deal contact
for that departments review.  Likewise, I will let you know when it has been
signed.  I cannot at this time tell you when this may be.
If you need quicker turnaround, we might consider counterpart execution
which would permit the documents to be signed simultaneously by WPSC.
Why are you requesting an original signed copy for the consultant.  A copy
should be sufficient. Don't you agree.
