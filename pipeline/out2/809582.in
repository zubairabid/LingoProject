The attached file contains updated July 2000 volume requirements for CES.  The
changes relative to the original request sent on 6/23/00.   Changes are
described on the worksheet labelled 'Comments' under the date 06/26/00.   The
only other change that I currently anticipate is to NIPSCO when they post our
July requirements on their EBB.

Please call me if you have questions, etc.
