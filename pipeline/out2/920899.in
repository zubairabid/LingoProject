The United Way Executive Solicitiation is underway.  You should have received
an e:mail message about a week or ten days ago which let you know that you
this year pledges should be made on line.  Mark Frevert reminded everyone at
today's ENA staff meeting to complete their pledges by Tuesday, August 8.  If
you have not already done so, I would encourage you to complete your pledges
before Tuesday.  Patti Thompson can tell you where to go on line to do this.

Peggy:  United Way may not apply in Canada, so ignore this if not
appropriate.
