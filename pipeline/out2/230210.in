Ketan is the person I spoke with Friday.  The appropriate contact at Trading
Edge is their credit manager, Joe Greenburg at 646-375-1318.     As noted
below, Joe agreed to accept a qualitative statement from Morgan Stanley that
the $25 million limit we are proposing is not excessive based on our
relationship with Morgan Stanley.
Thanks.
