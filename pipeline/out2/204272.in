Enron Public Affairs has launched a new initiative: ENRON UNIVERSITY
AFFAIRS.  The overall mission of Enron University Affairs is to broaden the
depth and scope of our relationships with targeted universities through
building Enron brand recognition on campuses, leveraging research exchanges
between Enron and the Academic community, and identifying commercial
opportunities for Enron.  This initiative should also further Enron,s efforts
to hire and retain the world,s most innovative employees.
Leading this initiative are Christie Patrick, Vice President, Mike Rosen,
Director and Cindy Derecskey, in conjunction with her position as Public
Affairs Coordinator will also work with the University Affairs team.
Please join me in congratulating Christie, Mike and Cindy on their new
responsibilities.
