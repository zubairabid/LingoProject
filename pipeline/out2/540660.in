Jennifer and Peter, welcome back...!
Attached are the notes from the EBS team and BMC organization regarding the
proposals to EBS and Net Works (etc.) from BMC.
I am curious, Peter (or Glenn), if it is reasonable of BMC to make the
statement to the effect that, "...the 45% discount is applied only if
we have the EBS Enron Partnership agreement in place...".  Is that cutting it
close on the restraint of trade issue?
Bob McAuliffe has informed me in a note that if his people (Matson & Cumming)
choose the BMC product at testing conclusion, he would support their
decision.  Smith and Ogg have given "no go" indications.  I have received
that information from Bruce Smith in a telephone conversation, but Jim Ogg's
lack of communication with me is what I have used to draw a similar
conclusion for his situation...
BMC and EBS both, I believe, are wanting GSS to do the contract work for this
deal.  It is my understanding, Peter, that the timing of that request might
be a problem for your guys...Perhaps we should have a quick, informal pow-wow
about this?
