Mike

I see that you have alot of the things that are on the error report, some of
which I am not sure that I have assigned to you.  If anyone tells you that
you are now doing something off of their desk, please refer them to me at
this time.  I don't want anyone to dump any the "crap", or less savory work
off of t heir desks onto you (we all have things we would prefer not to have
to do which still must be done, it just comes with the territory).  Also, let
me know if you feel comfortable with any additional shipper accounts.  I
would like to see you crosstrain with Sabrae after the Holidays.

Thanks,

Mary
