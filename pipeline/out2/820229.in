I give all void requests to Claudette Danials.  She enters all voids and stop
payments for the AP department now.  We cannot void MSA checks in SAP.  What
we do is a journal entry to reverse the original expense (converted to SAP
coding) and outstanding checks.  Lupe and the Wire Team do enter their own
voids when it is a wire, but since this one was a check, Claudette should
have it.  I do remember seeing the Goldman Sachs void request and I discussed
it with Lien Nguyen on our wire team before she gave it to Claudette.
