I'm curious to know how my lack of recent correspondence translates to a
neglect of my brainpower. If I didn't know better, I'd say that was a purely
conceited statement. But, of course, being the buff brain-builder that I am,
I know it's not.

So how are things "down" there in Seattle? I've been meaning to check in with
you and Michael to make sure you didn't lose any limbs in the big Quake of
'01. By the sounds of it you've been left with at least your digits and a
little imagination, which isn't half bad compared to the poor capitol
building in Olympia, whose crumbling edifice has turned into another of those
perfunctory "news" stories begging the question, "Just how much will I ever
care?" Last evening's t.v. news actually had the bad sense to show footage of
city construction workers picking their noses atop the dome while a coiffed
blonde anchorwoman alerted viewers to the "urgency of the building's
reconstruction" due to its "inability to be inhabited until 2003." Is it just
me, or do t.v. newspeople seem to act stupid on purpose?

Speaking of stupid, what exactly is walpurgis night? And the Pogues? I
realize I'm showing my lack of culture here, but curiosity always overtakes
my elegant facade sooner or later. Speaking of elegant, we're having another
party! And Amber might actually show up for this one, being that it's purpose
is to celebrate her birthday. First weekend in April, April 7 to be exact,
we'll be the proud hostesses of a 25th birthday/costume party. I'd love for
you and Michael to grace us with your presence, but it sounds like you'll be
halfway across the globe by then. If plans change, and for your sake I
certainly hope they don't, give us a call or just drop in on the 7th.

I've got to run - there are energy crises to be mitigated, you know. But drop
me a message before you take off for wine country. And watch out for falling
pieces of crumbling buildings.
