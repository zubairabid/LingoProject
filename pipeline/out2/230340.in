Hi Sara:

Below is an example of language we are currently using for common pricing.
We have been tailoring the language for each deal to specify which indices
the deals are priced on, however, we would like to have language that is
generic (i.e. Pricing to be effective only on the days when the applicable
indices are published, etc.).  Will you help us develop language for this?
Thank you!

Common Pricing:

Pricing to be effective only on the days when both the IPE is open and Platts
publish their dated Brent assessment.
