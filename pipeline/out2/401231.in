Phil Richardson and Sarah Tomalty of Dynegy say that they would probably
(i.e. subject to management approval) withdraw their protest if we would
amend our proposed tariff language to limit the quantity of capacity we can
acquire from PNM to 20,000/day.  Their chief concern is to prevent TW from
becoming simply a broker for another pipeline's capacity (which has never
been our intention).  Lorraine is discussing this with Steve to see whether
this is something we could live with.  The Commission has expressed the same
concern in the past, so this might make them more comfortable with our
proposal too.  Comments?  let me know.
