Health & Fitness Tip of the Day
Monday December 11, 2000

Strains

A strain is an injury to a muscle or tendon (the fibrous band that connects a
muscle to a bone). This can occur from improper movements or overuse. As with
sprains, the pain and swelling that occurs with a strain may be relieved with
rest, elevation, and cold compresses. Of course, see your physician before
initiating any treatment.
