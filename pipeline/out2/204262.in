Note:  Williams does not give the amount of volume response they received in
their open season.  540,000 Dth/d was their
established volume at the onset.  Also, it is interesting that they are
naming the Oklahoma intrastate markets as their market
for the project.

Western Frontier Pipe Gets Rave Reviews

After successfully completing a non-binding open season on Sept. 21, for the
Western Frontier project, Williams' gas pipeline unit plans to hold a binding
open season in the near future to gauge the exact market interest in the
project that would transport gas supply from the Rockies to the mid-continent
region.

"We are very pleased with the interest the market has shown in our Western
Frontier Project. We continue to believe that Western Frontier will be a
cost-effective way to bring economically-priced Rockies supply into the
mid-continent," said Kim Cocklin, vice president of customer services and
rates for Williams' Central and Texas Gas pipeline systems.

The Western Frontier Project is expected to transport up to 540,000 dth/d
from the Cheyenne Hub to Williams' Hugoton Compressor Station on the Central
system in southwest Kansas and its Oklahoma-Hugoton pipeline.

The project would also have access to ANR Pipeline, Panhandle Eastern
Pipeline, Northern Natural Gas and Natural Gas Pipeline of America. Williams
believes this project would be able to supply a "seamless transport at an
incremental cost" to Oklahoma intrastate markets by way of the Central
system. Through the Central system, customers would also be able to access
storage including directly owned and third party storage fields.

Williams expects Western Frontier's rates to Hugoton to fall in the mid-20
cents per dth. The company also expects a fuel rate of less than 1%. Expected
to be in service during November 2003, the project will require the
construction of almost 400 miles of pipeline and the addition of 13,000 HP.
