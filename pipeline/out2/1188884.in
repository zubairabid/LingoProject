I have not been given any reasons - the most "considered" list came from EBS
where I feel sure some of them were commercial.  I'm not so sure about the
EES and GPG lists.  These lists are going to some fairly senior people.  I'm
a bit hesitant to add to their workload if it isn't necessary.  My suggestion
would be that we ask for reasons or maybe further research on only those you
particularly want to list.
