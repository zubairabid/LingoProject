Flu shots continue to be available at the Enron Health Center, EB-307.  Flu
season lasts through March, so it's not too late for immunization.  For those
employee groups who find it difficult to be away from their desks,
arrangements can be made for the Health Center nurse to come to your floor to
administer the flu shots.  Contact the Health Center at ext. 3-6100 for more
information.
