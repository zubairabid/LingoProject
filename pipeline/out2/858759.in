Hi Folks,

First off, congratulations  on a great season.I assume if you,re  still in
the hunt this late in the year, you have to call 2000 a successful
campaign. Enjoy it. It,s an intense time and you can,t slack  off now but
it,s also important to enjoy the moment regardless of what happens  in the
next few weeks. It,s tough  enough just to get to this point.  Great work!

From my perspective it,s  interesting in that the actual number of folks who
read the material drops way  off this time of year. But the  other side of
the coin is that the interest level of the ones still reading  shoots through
the roof. There may  not be as many folks reading as there were in
September, but the ones that are  here are into in a big way!

I,ll do my dead level best  to keep up my end of the bargain and provide the
best info I can all the way to  the week 17 games. Lets get at  it.

Joe



Matchups to Avoid and Exploit.

Passing Game  Matchups. Here's how I see the matchups this  week. Please
note, see the  cheatsheet online (will be availablelate Wednesday evening
athttp://www.cheatsheets.net/week14sheet.htm  ) for exactly where I rank
players and to determine who to start. Just because one matchup may be more
favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily mean I'd start the player
with  the best matchup. The matchup info  is meant to be just one more tool
in your box when it comes to deciding between  players.

Note: I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info. The Fantasy Points Allowed by Position  numbers are from
ESPN.com.



Here we go:

Locks: These games heavily favor the Offense

New Orleans Passing Game  vs Bronco Defense I stuck my neck out a  bit
last week with QB Aaron Brooks but he came though for me. This week, he
draws a great matchup with  a Denver defense that,s not been able to stop
anyone through the air. Over the last four weeks, they rank # 31  in passing
yards allowed per game.  Denver has averaged giving up 308 yards passing per
game over that  span. With CB Ray Crockett out with  a torn hamstring, Jimmy
Spencer will fill in for him again this week. He and Terrell Buckley can
definitely be  beaten. Brooks will focus on WR Joe Horn, his primary weapon
but  Willie Jackson refuses to fade away and is a solid option. RB Chad
Morton catches the ball  pretty well out of the backfield.  TE Aaron Glover
still is total non factor for Fantasy  purposes. I'm doing my best to not
get  carried away with Brooks. Keep telling yourself the young man has
exactly  2 games of NFL experience. On the other hand, there comes a time
when you  take a leap and go with what you see with your own eyes. This guy
isn't  playing like a 2 game rookie and the Denver defense is awful.

St. Louis Passing Game vs  Carolina Defense I want to believe. I believe
in Kurt  Warner and I believe he,ll get his Rams back on track. As much as
anything, I believe you,ll  see Marshall Faulk at least see more action than
he saw last  week. Warner,s an MVP but I think  it,s Faulk that makes this
team go.  He creates so much havoc with the defense that must either commit
safeties to support the run which then opens the passing game. If the
defense plays the pass, then  Faulk can kill them with the run or short
passes. After last week, I,d be shocked if coach  Mike Martz doesn,t get
back to utilizinghisstar RBmore. Kurt Warner makes his return and I,m
guessing he picks up where he left off.  That,s not what you,d expect to
happen but Warner,s made a career of  exceeding expectations. If he,s on
your roster, I think you have to go with him. Especially against this
defense. Carolina ranks # 30 in passing yards  allowed per game over the
last four weeks.  For WRs, it,s always tough to pick.  Isaac Bruce and
Torry Holt are the sure guys but honestly, Ricky Proehl,s  been on fire
lately. Az-Zahir Hakim  is always worth a shot too. Any one  of these guys
can go off. TE Roland  Williams suffers with so many good receivers but he,s
a decent producer  too.

Atlanta Passing Game vs  Seattle Defense This one is a pure matchup play
as  Dan Reeves makes the move for startingQB Doug Johnson over the  fading
Chris Chandler. I,m not a  big fan of either but if you find yourself faced
with the prospect of starting a  Falcon QB, this is the week to do it if you,
re ever going to. The Seahawks defense is less like a hawk  and more like an
albatross around Mike Holmgren,s neck. They,re awful. Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 29  in passing yards allowed per game.  Good luck picking
the WR as Terrance Mathis has been  invisible lately while Shawn Jefferson is
making a  resurgence. A few weeks ago, it was  Mathis who was hot while
Jefferson faded.  If you made me pick one, I,d reluctantly go with
Jefferson. TE Reggie Kelly did  catch 3 passes Sunday but I,m not counting
on him for too  much.

Pittsburgh Passing Game  vs Raider Defense Kor-DELL(Kor-DELL(Kor-DELL
What brought this guy back  to life? I dunno but you can bet  coach Bill
Cowher is going to do everything he can to keep it rolling. Kordell Stewart
looks to be  playing with renewed confidence and we all know that so much of
the game at this  level is mental. No one ever  doubted his physical
skills. The  obvious spark seems to have been the benching of WR Plaxico
Burress and the inspired play of Hines Ward. I think it,s ironic that Ward
was very  much a Kordell-like &Slash8 player in college at Georgia. Bobby
Shaw is getting into the  act and producing from the WR slot and wonders of
wonders, TE Mark  Bruener caught a TD Sunday. You  know things are changing
when Bruener gets in the endzone. The Raiders are an extremely good
football team but stopping teams through the air is their Achilles  heel.

Cincinnati Passing Game  vs Cardinal Defense Another interesting aspect of
writing this column late in the season is that you can almost guess which
players to talk about as most Fantasy Teams still interested in December are
stocked with the obvious stars.  QB Scott Mitchell likely doesn,t fall into
that &star8  category and I doubt many folks are faced with the decision to
start him this  week but if he,s your best QB, this might be your lucky
week. First of all, let,s assume he gets the  knee ready to go. This early
in the  week, that,s honestly a shaky assumption.  We,ll know more later.
But  if he can go, he could do some damage against an awful Cardinal
defense. WR Peter Warrick could be a  decent play too although Aeneas
Williams is a solid cover guy. He,s hard to count out though just  because
of his home run ability.  Funny how I don,t see many people complaining
about his 40 times  now( RB Corey Dillon is the  only other starter on this
team but we,ll catch up with him in the rushing  Matchups.



Prime Matchups: These games favor the  Offense

Arizona Passing Game vs  Bengal Defense Let,s be clear, I,m no Jake
Plummer fan but the truth of the matter is he,s got a pretty decent matchup
this week. He,s reportedly making  good progress and should start Sunday.
Partly because, he,s better, partly because Dave Brown was just  awful.
&Worse than Plummer8 has a  nasty ring to it( But this Bengal  pass defense
is pretty bad. Over  the past four weeks, they rank # 26 in passing yards
allowed  per game. WRs David Boston has the physical  tools to do some
damage and Frank Sanders has the experience to make an  impact. Remember,
this is the unit  that made Pittsburgh look like the 1999 Rams last week.

New York Jets Passing  Game vs Colts Defense The Jets have been up and down
a  bit but this week they could make some noise against a struggling
Indianapolis  defense. The pathetic Colt pass  rush only has 4 sacks in the
last 4 games.  QB Vinny Testeverde had a decent day in their last matchup
with  271 yards and 1 TD. WR Wayne  Chrebet,s been in a funk lately but in
their week he went off catching 8  passes for 140. Sure some of it was
late, but garbage stats count too.  Dedric Ward caught just 54 yards worth
of passes but he scored in  that game. He,s come on lately  after fading
early. Rookie WR Laveranues Coles will miss another game it  appears. RB
Curtis Martin still is struggling to get 100% healthy  and that will hurt a
little. TE  Anthony Becht is a bright spot as he,s beginning to contribute.
December in New York will make a  difference to this soft Colt team which
doesn,t play as well in the  cold.

Detroit Passing Game vs  Viking Defense Charlie Batch continued to  look
good and went a good ways toward erasing some of his (well deserved)
candybone label with a gutsy performance on Thanksgiving. His ribs are
reportedly better and he  had a nice practice Tuesday throwing the ball.
The Viking secondary could have  matchup troubles with WRs Johnnie Morton and
Herman Moore. Over the last four weeks, Minnesota  ranks # 24 in passing
yards allowed  per game. For the year, they rank # 22 in Fantasy  Points
allowed to opposing QBs. The  Vikings are tough on TEs ranking # 7 in
Fantasy Points allowed to TEs for the  year but TE David Sloan has played
very well of late. He ranks # 6 in Fantasy Points among TEs  over the last 3
games and is well worth a start here.

Denver Passing Game vs Saints Defense  For all the hype generated by New
Orleans, defense, they give up tons of  yards passing. Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 23 in passing yards allowed  per game. They do sack the
QB a ton (19 over the  last four weeks) but they still give up the yards. It,
s kind of unusual to see  that. They,ll be facing Gus Frerotte and a Denver
team that,s trying to  find their way. Frerotte,s been up  and down after
his monster week 12 game.  The Saints continue to drop like flies and the
loss of CB Fred Weary will  definitely hurt. Both WRs Rod  Smith and Ed
McCaffrey are solid plays as always. And as crazy as it sounds, either one
of  the 2 headed TE monster in Dwayne Carswell and Desmond Clark are decent
options too. Byron Chamberlain  normally makes it a 3 headed TE monster but
he,s nursing a bad Achilles tendon  and didn,t play last week. As noted
above, Denver gives up lots of yards through the air so this could be a high
scoring affair. I doubt you could  have predicted a shootout between Aaron
Brooks and Gus Frerotte 4 months ago but  that,s why they play the games(





Even  Matchups: These games feature no  real advantage either way

Chicago Passing Game vs Packer  Defense  I,m torn  here. You probably saw
how weak the  Packer defense looked Monday night.  They couldn,t do much of
anything.  But on the other hand, the Bears will likely go with Shane
Matthews and  he,s been just awful lately. Like  worse than Dave Brown kind
of bad.  One would think he,d improve against this defense but he,ll have to
make  great strides just to get reach &average8. Owners of WR Marcus
Robinson feel it too as the big guy has pretty much disappeared lately  with
Matthews at the helm. Still  though, there,s some hope. On a  brighter
spot, Matthews does seem comfortable throwing to Eddie  Kennison who had 6
passes thrown to him Sunday compared to Robinson,s  4. I,ve hear rumors that
Chicago  may start a TE but that news is unconfirmed at this time( In the
"for  real" rumor department, QB Cade McNown is making noise about  wanting
to start this week but I think it's still a week  early.

New  England Passing Game vs Chief Defense Kansas City and New England are
two once proud teams that are struggling.  This week a banged up Drew
Bledsoefaces a pass  defense that,s been vulnerable.  Over the last four
weeks, Kansas City ranks # 20  in  passing yards allowed per game. For the
year, KC ranks # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed  to opposing QBs. Bledsoe
bruised a knee in Thursday,s game but played through it  and should be ok.
Keep an eye on  him though as he was added to the injury report this week as
Questionable. As  long as Bledsoe plays, WR Terry  Glennshould be a good
option as he,s clearly the #1 guy in that offense over  Troy  Brown. TE Rod
Rutledge  caught 4 passes  last week so he may start to make some noise.
With all those productive years throwing  to Ben Coates, you know Bledsoe
would love to have a solid  TE.



Carolina Passing Game vs Rams  Defense Even if you want to pin Carolina,s
Monday Night performance on a weak Green Bay defense, credit still must be
given  to Steve  Beuerleinand the  Panthers. The immobile Beuerlein  hung in
there and delivered. He,s  facing a Rams defense that even with Bud Carson,s
help, still ranks # 19  in  passing yards allowed per game. (Granted, that,s
a big improvement) Beuerlein,s numbers may be helped by the  return of Ram
QB Kurt Warner as there,s nothing like the other team rolling up  points to
get your QB,s arm loose.  WR  Muhsin Muhammad had the dominating  game we
all know he can and looked overpowering. The hamstring injury was supposed
to be  with him all year but he looks good to me.  Another boost for
Beuerlein will be if WR Donald  Hayescan get back on  the field as early
reports are hoping for.  Even TE Kris  Mangum(be the one guy  in your league
that doesn,t say &mag-num8 like the gun) has been looking  good. For the
year, St. Louis ranks  # 28 in Fantasy Points allowed to the TE so he could
be worth a shot.

Jacksonville Passing Game vs Browns  Defense This one really is a case of
misdirection as QB Mark  Brunellisn,t as good as  many people think and the
Browns pass defense isn,t as bad as most people  assume. Cleveland ranks #
18  in  passing yards allowed per game. And for the year, they rank # 6 in
Fantasy Points allowed to opposing QBs which really surprises people. The
reason is that their rush defense is  awful and teams choose to run instead.
But all you really care about are the stats. Brunell should be ok but not
great here  as the Jaguars look to take out a season,s worth of frustrations
on the  Browns.  Jimmy  Smithand  Keenan  McCardellare solid choices  as
usual. Even the much maligned  (by me, anyway) rookie R. Jay  Sowardproduced
last  week. Soward could actually be bad  news for McCardell and Smith as
there were times when Brunell really seemed to  force the ball his way.  TE
Kyle Bradyis solid. But honestly, I think this will be the  Fred Taylor on
the ground show against a weak rush  unit.

Washington Passing Game vs Giant  Defense Brad  Johnsonmakes his return
this week taking over for Jeff George.  It,s interesting to watch how the
Redskins spin this transition. According to Washington, Johnson  starting
has nothing to do with Jeff George,s less than spectacular play or  record.
&Johnson was the starter  all along regardless of how George played yada
yada(8 This type of talk makes it easier to  sell the fans Jeff George as
the starting QB next year. We,ll see. (for the record, I,m a George fan
and  have been for a while. Myself and 8  other guys are pretty much it()
Like most players in this &could go either way8 category, Johnson has  good
and bad points this week. On  the upside, the Giants defense has shown
itself to be vulnerable to the  pass. The Redskins also hope to  have RB
Stephen Davisthis week. His presence does a great deal for the  passing
game. On the downside,  Johnson will likely be rusty. He  may still be
feeling some lingering effects of the injury. Secondly, his best  WR,
Albert Connellmay play but he,s  nowhere near full speed.  James
Thrashfilled in  admirably for Connell and looks to be a good play this week
as well. It looks like  Irving  Fryarwill get the  start opposite Thrash.
The ageless  wonder might do something if Jason Sehorn stays with Thrash as
Dave Thomas is by  far the weaker CB.  TE  Stephen Alexanderis a steady
performer although FB Larry  Centerssteals too many  of the short passes that
could go to Alexander.

New  York Giant Passing Game vs Redskin Defense A good defense takes on a
good passing  offense. I guess that,s why this  matchup is in this column.
Over the  last four weeks Washington ranks # 15 in  passing yards allowed per
game. For the year, they rank # 8 in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing QBs
so they,re pretty tough. QB Kerry  Collinshas quietly  played extremely well
over the last month.  He,s thrown for 822 yards and 6 TDs over the last 3
games. That puts him at # 6 in Fantasy Points  among QBs over that time
span.  WR  Amani Toomercontinues to play  great football and is definitely
worth a shot. Joe  Jureviciusfills in for the  injured Ike Hilliard again
and he,s a solid choice as Collins didn,t hesitate to  throw him the ball
often.  TE Pete Mitchell  is tough to depend  on as he gets more catches
but Dan  Campbellgrabs the TDs it  seems. I,m not too excited about  either
guy.

San  Diego Passing Game vs 49er Defense My Charger buddies have cautioned
me about jumping on the Ryan LeafBandwagon. That was right after I,d sent a
group  email at halftime of the SD / KC game to some friends boasting about
&my8 QB  Leaf. Of course, we know the  nd half didn,t go &quite8 as well as
the first and I came back to  reality. But there,s some truth to  the idea
Leaf is becoming an NFL QB.  I personally had doubts if we,d ever see it but
I think it,s starting to  happen. And this week against a San  Francisco
defense, he could make some more strides. It should be noted, the 49ers are
much  better on pass defense than they had been.  Over the last four weeks,
they rank # 14 in passing yards allowed per  game which is a huge upgrade
from where they had been. For the year though, they still rank #  30 in
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB. Leaf has some extremely solid
receivers.  TE  Freddie Jonesis his best  target but veteran WRs Jeff Graham
and Curtis  Conwayare more than  capable. You,d think that San  Francisco
will score some points so there could be some fireworks. I,d shy away from
Leaf but Jones in  particular could be a very nice play.

San Francisco  Passing Game vs Charger Defense The Charger defense held
Kansas City  down last week but I think that had more to do with Warren Moon,
s senior citizen  status than it did the Charger D.  Granted they,re
improving, but I think San Francisco should be able to  move the ball. Over
the last four  weeks, San Diego ranks # 13 in passing yards allowed per
game. QB Jeff Garciais coming off a bye week and  should be rested and
prepared. His  biggest problem will be the toe injury to WR Terrell Owens.
Owens was unable to complete practice  Monday and it,s now looking like it
could be later this week before he sees the  practice field. Coach Steve
Mariucci didn,t sound too optimistic.  Although I can imagine worse
scenarios for a WR than having  Jerry  Riceas your best WR. Owens will
definitely be missed but  J.J.  Stokesand  Tai  Streetswill fill in just
fine. There had been some talk from Mariucci  about resting Garcia to see
how the rookie QBs Gio Carmazzi and Tim Rattay would  fare in game
situations. I think  this is just talk at this point. I  don,t really see
the Chargers blowing out San Francisco to the point Garcia  could be pulled.
If Garcia gets San  Francisco such a lead that he could be pulled, he would
have probably earned a  great day of stats by then anyway.  At least for
this week, I,m thinking he,ll be fine in the playing time  department.

Minnesota Passing  Game vs Lion Defense Ok, this is tough matchup for the
Vikings. Detroit ranks # 6 in passing yards allowed per gameover the last
four  games. But the Lions are dealing  with several injuries in their
secondary including Safety Ron Rice (leg )  probable) Kurt Schulz
(ankle-doubtful) and nickel back Marquis Walker  (wrist-out) Still though,
you,re  crazy if you don,t start QB Daunte Culpepperand  WRs Randy  Mossand
Cris  Carter. They,re just too  good.

Kansas  City Passing Game vs Patriot Defense It,s early to make a call but
it,s  looking like QB Elvis  Grbacwill be back this  week. That,s great news
for Chief  fans and Fantasy Owners. The  Patriots rank # 10 in passing yards
allowed per game over the last four weeks  but those numbers are a little
skewed as Detroit, Cincinnati, Cleveland and  Buffalo were the opponents.
It,s  not like they shut down the Rams or 49ers.  Grbac will look to get his
# 1 target TE Tony  Gonzalezback on track  after he was shut out by the
Chargers.  I don,t think you,ll see that again with Grbac under center. WR
Derrick  Alexanderis an excellent  target too. Rookie  Sylvester
Morrisseems to be  fading instead of getting better.  He may be hitting the
infamous &rookie wall8.



Downside Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Dallas  Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Emmitt Smith seems recovered
from  his &knockout slap8 Thursday and says he,ll start. That,s good news
for all aspects of the  Dallas offense.  QB  Troy Aikmansquares off  against
a Tampa defense that's bark is worse than its bite. Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 21  in  passing yards allowed per game. Although they
have registered 12 sacks  over that span which is towards the top of the
league. They,re solid though. WRs Wayne  McGarityand  James  McKnightare
showing  they,re not anything exceptional.  TE  Jackie Harriswas injured
last  week and David  LaFluerwoke up with a  great game.

Cleveland Passing Game vs Jaguar  Defense One has to ask if anyone really
cares whether QBsDoug  Pedersonor  Spergon  Wynngets the majority  of the
snaps. I think I can say  fairly confidently that neither of these guys have
been figuring heavily into  your plans. The Jaguar defense has  improved
significantly of late. They rank # 17  in  passing yards allowed per
gameover the last  four weeks and they should be plenty good enough to
contain the Browns. This team never really had a chance once  Tim Couch and
Errict Rhett went down.  Kevin  Johnsonand  David  Patten handle the WR
duties but I can,t advocate either with a clear conscience.  TE  AaronShea
will start for  the Browns but probably not for your FF Team.

Green  Bay Passing Game vs Bear Defense It,s hard to know what to think
about Green Bay. One game they look like the Packers of old with Favre
working  his magic and the next, they look like a shell of their former
selves as they  did on Monday Night against a Carolina team that had no
business handling them  as they did.  Brett  Favreis still a decent  bet to
sling a few TDs on any Sunday but he,s sadly become just an average  Fantasy
QB. Lately, the Bears have  been tough against the pass ranking # 12 in
passing yards allowed per game over  the last four weeks. Although for  the
year, they rank # 29 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB. Favre
will have the very disappointing  Antonio  Freemanto throw to  although Bill
Schroederis putting up  better numbers the last few weeks.  He has another
advantage in that while Freeman will likely draw CB Thomas  Smith, Schroeder
likely goes against Jerry Azumah. Remember Schroeder came up huge in the
week 5 matchup with 2 TDs in the 4th quarter. For a TE, I,d go with  Bubba
Franksalthough whenever  I say that it seems Tyrone  Daviscatches a  TD(

Seattle Passing Game vs Falcon  Defense This is an interesting game as two
proud coaches in Dan Reeves and Mike Holmgren lead teams that are
floundering. The one bright spot  for the Falcons is that they,ve yielded
few yards passing although the &glass is  half empty8 crowd will point out
that the reason for that is the weak rush  defense. Why throw the ball when
you can run on Atlanta? Regardless  of the reason, teams don,t throw much
against the Falcons and I don,t look for  QB Jon Kitnato  completely break
that trend. He,ll  be looking to quiet producers Sean Dawkinsand Derrick
Mayes.  Dawkins in particular has been exceptional over the last few weeks
and is  probably worth a start.

Indianapolis Passing  Game vs Jets Defense I love  Peyton  Manningbut he,s
a guy that doesn,t  always post the Fantasy Football numbers to match his
hype. He,s a solid producer who,ll very rarely  burn you but he,s also not
too subject to the 400 yard / 4 TD day. With that said, I think you,ll see
another good, solid day from him against a Jet defense that,s tough. Over
the last four weeks, New York ranks  # 11 in passing yards allowed per game.
For the year, they rank # 7 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  QB.
Manning will try to jump start  his team that,s floundering a bit.  They
know they need a win and a team like this can be tough when  &cornered8. I,m
not heeding the  grumblings about WR  Marvin Harrison. He,s fine. He caught
2 TDs last week and has stated  he needs to &get on a mission8 although he
needs some help. Jerome Pathonhad some horrendous drops. E.G. Greenhopes to
be back this week from  a knee injury and that will be good news.  Terrence
Wilkins and Pathon just aren,t getting it done. TEs Marcus Pollardand  Ken
Dilgerboth catch just enough to make  neither guy very valuable.



Oakland Passing Game  vs Steeler Defense QB Rich Gannonis garnering lots of
talk about  the league MVP. Could be. But  he,s got a tough matchup this
week against a Steeler team playing with  confidence. Pittsburgh ranks # 8
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. For the season,
they rank # 2 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing QB so that,s
strong. WRTim Brownis the clear cut target of  choice and that makes things
great for Brown owners. You know he,ll get his touches. Andre Risonand
James  Jettwill get the scraps left  over. TE Ricky Dudleyis a guy who you
play totally  at your own risk. He,s just as  liable to go catchless as he
is score 2 TDs.



Defensive Slam Dunks: These games heavily favor the  Defense



Miami  Passing Game vs Bills Defense  Let,s  see(Jay  Fiedlercoming back
from  a shoulder injury, in what will likely be horrible weather conditions,
against  the # 2 ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the
last four  weeks. That,s what you,ve got in  this game and it,s enough to
have me looking elsewhere if I,ve got Dolphin  passing game players. I,d
start who  ever you did last week if Fiedler is your QB. If you have to
start a Miami WR, I,d  roll the dice on the unheralded Leslie  Shepherdwho,s
catching  more than anyone thought he would.  Slim pickings with this
matchup after that.

Buffalo Passing Game vs Dolphin  Defense Let,s  see(Rob  Johnsoncoming back
from  his latest injury, in what will likely be horrible weather conditions,
against  the # 3 ranked defense in passing yards allowed per game over the
last four  weeks. This sounds familiar( Seriously, this game ought to be a
defensive struggle as two dominant defenses square off in the snow against
mediocre offenses. Rob Johnson will  get the start but as usual, won,t
finish the game. Eric  Mouldswill gather the  majority of catches and is
probably too good not to start just because he,s so  talented and he does
grab the lions share of passes thrown. TE Jay  Reimersmais fast regaining
his place as one of the best TEs in the game and depending on the weather
here,  he could be the best receiving choice.

Philadelphia Passing Game vs Titan  Defense Understand that this is a bad
matchup for Donovan McNabband the Eagles but so was last week against
Washington. And all McNabb did was  win Offensive Player of the Week
honors.  Outside of McNabb and TE Chad Lewis, I can,t recommend any other
players as  starters. Neither  WRsCharles  Johnsonor Torrance  Smallscare
anyone. The Titans are an athletic and physical  unit that you,d think would
give McNabb trouble. And truthfully, the Washington  game would have likely
been different if "spy" LaVarr Arrington hadn't been hurt  early. The lack
of a passing game threat really hurts as Tennessee will  likely be able to
handle the WRs with man coverage and commit more personnel to  the run and
McNabb. Still, if he,s  by far your best QB, I,d roll the dice with him as
he,s made a season out of  proving people wrong.



Tennessee Passing Game vs Eagle  Defense Steve  McNairranks # 23 among QBs
over the last 3 games in Fantasy Points per game. That,s not real solid. I
don,t see him suddenly improving his  play against an Eagle defense that
ranks # 5 in passing yards allowed per  game. And for the year, they rank #
3 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing QB. The Eagles have 15 sacks
over the  last 4 games and while McNair is tough guy to sack, it,s obvious
the Eagles will  pressure him. His WR corps in  Derrick Masonand  Chris
Sandersaren,t  the greatest. As usual, his best  option will be TE Frank
Wycheck.  Wycheck struggled last week with some uncharacteristic drops, but
this  week he could be an asset as McNair likely won,t have a lot of time to
throw.

Tampa Bay Passing Game vs Cowboy  Defense Who knows where the  Shaun
KingRoller Coaster  Ride will take us this week? He,s  nursing a back strain
but practiced Wednesday and looks good to go. The Cowboys surprisingly have
played  decent pass defense ranking # 9 in passing yards allowed per game.
Of course, that,s largely because no  team feels the need to throw the ball
when they can run at will. King will spread the ball between  WRs  Keyshawn
Johnsonand  Jacquez  Green. I,m not especially excited about either  but it,
s very hard to turn your back on Keyshawn. TE Dave  Mooreis a fine  producer
and I,d feel comfortable starting him.
