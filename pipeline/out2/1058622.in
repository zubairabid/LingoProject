As you know, Enron,s United Way Executive Solicitation is well under way.
August 9th is the target date to achieve 100% participation and finalize the
commitment from our executives and is also the date for the kick-off of the
company wide drive.  We have a way to go to meet this objective.  Enron,s
United Way goal for the year is $2.3 million (before the corporate match).
ENW,s share of this goal is $161,700.  While these are aggressive goals, they
are very doable, and if everyone contributes their fair share, we can easily
surpass these goals.

Along with focusing on meeting our financial goals, I,d like to have 100%
participation throughout the organization.  This is especially important
among our executives.  We define "participation" as an employee who has
completed their pledge on-line and made a contribution, no matter what the
level.

With the campaign going on-line with electronic pledging, I,ll need the
support of you and your campaigners to increase participation levels across
the ENW organization and reach our financial goals.  Whatever your decision
regarding the level of your pledge, we need 100% participation from our
Executives in order to set a good example for the rest of ENW.  Your
contribution to the United Way will continue to make a difference in our
community.  When you give, you change a life right here in our community.

Please join me in setting the standard for ENW by giving generously and
getting your pledges in by August 9th.
