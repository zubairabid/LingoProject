The person to contact, I believe, is Michael Hinds.  His number is 55869.
However, Ace Roman, who sits on our floor and is a manager with the group,
should help you coordinate, particularly with the LJM lawyers.  His number is
39587.  Kirkland and Ellis out of DC does their legal work.  Amy Harvey, who
I believe is an associate there, worked with us on the "E-Next Generation"
deal.  Her number is 202-879-5053.
Thanks,
Rose
