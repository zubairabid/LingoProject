Stewart,
Yesterday at our meeting with Tim, I thought it was fairly clear that efforts
were to be made before deals were done to check out authorization.  This
morning you tell us you have done a 3 year deal with Merced and ask us to
check out the authorization question after the fact.   This is exactly the
opposite of what I thought we were all trying to do.  We don't really need to
call Merced.  We have the relevant legal paper.  You need to get  the
attorney from the finance group, Sara,  to tell you whether or not Merced is
authorized to do the deal you have already done.
I am working with the guys at Turlock to check out their authorizations.
