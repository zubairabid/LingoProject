Jane, I still have two discrepancies with Southwest Gas which I need your
help in resolving.
1.  SWG says price on Sitara 518455 Day 7 should be $9.50 instead of $9.55 -
You have already confirmed with me that the price should be $9.55.  I
forwarded your email to my contact at SWG and she responded with the email
below.  Could you please call SWG trader Mark Anderson so that this can be
resolved?
2.  On Sitara 386140 SWG says trigger is calculated on physical, not
scheduled, volume - You have already confirmed with me that the trigger is
based on scheduled volume and that you feel SWG will not agree.  According to
my contact at SWG, their trader Bill Brown confirmed with her that the
trigger is based on physical volume.  Can you please call Bill so that this
discrepancy can be resolved?
I appreciate your help in resolving these issues.  Although I have already
forwarded your responses to Nancy at SWG, she is being very insistent that
SWG is correct and is requesting that the traders resolve these issues.
