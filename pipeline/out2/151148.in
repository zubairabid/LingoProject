Gerald,
Here is their response to our comments.  Not much but take a look:
Under term7:  Notices - unless we include language similiar to...'Fax is
acceptable as long as the fax is followed by hardcopy documentation and
effective upon such hardcopy reciept.'  Back to square one.  They don't like
fax.
Under term 8:  they are objecting to affiliate assignment.  Successor is ok.
Affiliate assignment is no good.  They would like to take out the term
assigns.
that is it.
