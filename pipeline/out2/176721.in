Jeff, I assume you can coordinate a conference call from work.  Call me at

Excellent points and I was thinking along similar lines.  Questions I have:
How do you know that LT debt gives more advantageous terms?  We have no yield
curve info nor do we know their credit rating.
At what point does their borrowing exceed their covenents?
Is our strategy to not raise the required $66million or to stop/slow PPE
spending so that the $66m is not needed?
