Roses are red...

...chocolates are sweet. And when it comes to Valentine's Day, bubbly
can't be beat. Et voila: come February 14, we recommend Champagne &
Truffles, the most romantically indulgent couple since Scott
and Zelda.

On the other hand, if hearts and roses make you think red, Merlot &
Chocolate will surpass the most beautifully bittersweet ecstasy
you're capable of conjuring.

After that (and a glance at the selections offered below), you and
your love dove are on your own. Swirl, sniff, sip, taste, savor,
relax, and enjoy.

Wine and Romance

Everybody seems to agree that wine and romance go hand in hand, so we
asked our Wine Team - a seasoned group of experts boasting 150 years
of collective experience - exactly why and how love and wine are
linked. Here are their professional observations.

Lee Codding:
Wine is made with care and passion, which can't help but transmit
itself to the drinker. It's only natural for wine to have a central
place in romance, because love is an essential ingredient in
its production.

Peter Granoff:
Candy may be dandy and liquor quicker, but nothing extends a romantic
moment like a fine wine.

Maire Murphy:
When we describe wine, we describe its body, texture, taste, and
experience. That, in itself, is romantic.

Diana Jacklich:
Ever wonder why wine language is rife with such adjectives as sexy,
seductive, smooth, velvety, and lush? Because wine is one of the last
legal sybaritic pursuits.

Carolyn Dempsey:
Wine evokes sensory pleasure and sustenance, which lift the spirit
and return us to what really matters. Whether it's the nourishment of
breaking bread and sharing stories, or simply the nurturing nature of
wine itself (which eases the mind and soothes the soul), it's about
taking time to savor the beautiful.

Maire Murphy:
There exist some dessert wines that must be sipped only from a
woman's navel. If that isn't romantic, what is?

Julian Davies:
Of course, no woman in her right mind would drop her laundry without
half a bottle of '47 Cheval Blanc down her....

Peter Granoff:
Wine lovers are wrong when they say that great wine is like sex.
Great wine is sex. The delicacy and tenderness involved in opening a
fine old bottle of wine is a kind of foreplay, and great wine, like
the act of love, engages us on many levels: sensory, emotional,
and intellectual.

Diana Jacklich:
"The soft extractive note of an aged cork being withdrawn has the
true sound of a man opening his heart" (William Samuel Benwell).

Jeff Prather:
Wine makes us giddy with youthful energy; it makes us feel warm and
fuzzy; it causes us to say silly things and mean them; it reduces our
inhibitions; it's a sensual magnifier; it's a powerful muse; it makes
everything taste better. Oh, did I say wine? Well then, wine must be
bottled love.

Peter Granoff:
Romance engages all the senses -- as does a fluted glass of
Champagne, especially when savored by candlelight. It's a sensory
treat in all respects: It sparkles like the eyes of your beloved,
offers the same delight to the nose as the object of your affection,
and when you bring it to your lips....

Taking Peter's cue, Tim Gaiser provides further dining advice:
If Champagne is our most romantic wine, there's no better occasion
than Valentine's Day for a Champagne dinner. It enables you to (1)
serve everything at the same time and (2) not do any cooking
whatsoever. Just pick up a bottle or two of your favorite bubbly,
plus an assortment of caviar, cheeses, pates, fresh shellfish, smoked
trout/salmon/scallops, chocolates, and any other finger food that
strikes your fancy. Invite that special someone to the table, open
the first bottle, and simply let nature, romance, intimate
conversation, true love, and amateur wrestling take their course.

In the Cork Boards: Red Wine and Headaches

Does wine make your head hurt? It does for MJBNYC. "Whenever I drink
California wine ... a migrane is triggered and I wind up in severe
pain," he wrote recently on the wine.com Cork Boards. "Does anyone
know what is present -- or not -- in CA wine that initiates my bad
reaction?" Cork Boarders have already presented a variety of
theories. Click here to join the discussion.
