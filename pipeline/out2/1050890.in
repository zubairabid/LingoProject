Kevin Ruscetti would like to trade Physical Index transactions for delivery
to ANR ML7 based on the above referenced Index. He tells me that it is widely
known that delivery at ANR ML7 is secondary firm, and states that if allowed
to transact on this the language would need to state that the parties would
employ their 'best efforts' to deliver.

Joe - can you try and find me some Confirm language for this.

Comments, please.
