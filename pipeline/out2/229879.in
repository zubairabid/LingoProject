The Counterparty has completed the move to their new office.  I called both
Charles Kaufman and Randy Beevis.  Counterparty is anxious to executed the
ISDA.  However, Randy is wanting to eliminate there revised Guaranty as part
of the package for execution.  Stated that this will hold up the process of
execution.  When you get a moment, please buzz me so that we can discuss.
Thanks you help.
