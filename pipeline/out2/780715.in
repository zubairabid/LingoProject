I agreed to report to you after my meeting with  Brazos on where things
stand. Such is the purpose of this email.

Unfortunately, all I can tell you at this point is  that Brazos is
considering its options and deciding onits best course of  action.

Insofar as timing is concerned,I do not  anticipate hearing from them until
after Thanksgiving. In the interim, I do not  recommend that you attempt to
contact Brazos or its counsel.

One of the subjects that we covered at the meeting  was the results of the
legal analysis on the damage issue. In that  regard,I would like to thank
Karl and Tom for getting me the information  Irequested. I was able to work
that information into the meeting. I did  not, however, hear from any of you
on incidental or consequential damages. If  youthink that you will have
those damages, you should let me know. I will  forward that information to
Brazos and its counsel.

In the interim, I plan on calling Rick one or two  more times to make sure
that I fully understand all of the numbers. The part of  the meeting dealing
with the numbers was very illuminating for Brazos and its  counsel, and I
would like tothank Carl and Rick for all of their effort.  That should not,
however,be interpreted as a sign that Brazos will accept  your proposal.

If I don't speak to you before the holiday, I want  to wish all of you a good
holiday.
