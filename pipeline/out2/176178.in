Jeff:  I work in the International PR group in Houston, where I'm responsible
for South America.  As you might imagine, the California crisis is receiving
substantial media coverage in the region.  In particular, it's being used by
opponents of deregulation to bolster their position.  My colleagues also say
that it's receiving the same play in India and elsewhere.  In order to shed
more light than heat on the subject and "arm" our people in Brazil with some
useful information on the issue, I'm attempting to put together some key
messages and Q&As.  One obvious question is:  What are Enron's business
dealings with California?  Both Rob Bradley and Miyung Buster mentioned you
as the "expert", so I'm hoping you could provide with the answer to the above
question.  Regards, Keith
