Jonathan,

One thing we might be able to propose is a "Credit Matrix" which prescribes a
Credit Line under which each counterparty can transact - with collateral
rights and collateral thresholds tied to the credit rating of each
counterparty.  We have used credit matrixes in several contracts here and
they are appealing in that there are no Material Adverse Change (MAC)
clauses.  This is appealing to the counterparty in that we cannot
automatically drop their collateral threshold to zero when a MAC occurs.  We
are comfortable because as the counterparty's credit quality deteriorates,
the amount of exposure to which we are subject decreases.  I would propose to
IBJ something like the following in lieu of a full CSA.  Jane and John - is
it possible to draft these collateral/credit terms into the contract without
using a full CSA?  (I think every matrix I have used here has been part of a
CSA).

Rating (S&P)     Credit Line
AA or above    $20MM
BBB+ to AA-    $15MM
BBB     $10MM
BBB-     $7MM
BB- to BB+    $5MM
Below BB-    $1MM

These terms are subject to negotiation.  Once again, the matrix removes MAC
clauses and the stress counterparties associate with such, but effectively
reduces the potential exposure we have (or THEY have) to a counterparty with
diminishing credit quality.

What do you all think?

John
