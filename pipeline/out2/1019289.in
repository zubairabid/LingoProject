Forgot to tell you that Joe and I went to see the Jim Rome show when he was
in Houston a couple of weeks ago .  It was pretty good.  Too bad you'll never
see him in Omaha.  Guess what else?  We got a memo today that Enron is giving
all of its employees a home  computer and will subsidize their internet
connection.  Gift is part of their commitment to techonology.  Does your
company do this with your telephones?
