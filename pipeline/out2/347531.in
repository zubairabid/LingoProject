First, I want to thank everyone that presented for their efforts.  I thought
the presentations were great and highlighted some key issues.

Second, below you will find electronic copies of each of the presentations
(in case you don't already have).  I will try and get the material out for
our next meeting before the meeting - sorry about the mix up this time.

You should also find below a memo that highlights the discussion from
yesterday.  It still appears to me that most people on the Working Group
recognize the ability to begin to undertake a more rigorous Regulatory Risk
analysis.  It also appears that this process is not limited to only the US.

I would really like to hear people's comments.  Please feel free to either
call me or send an e-mail.

I will be setting up the next meeting very soon.  The goal is to begin to
define the process, the data necessary, and the reporting.

Thanks for everything.
