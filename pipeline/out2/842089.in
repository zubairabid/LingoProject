I just wanted to pass along my thanks for the efforts of your team.  The
automatic bridge to Sitara and Tagg will save us an extraordinary amount of
time; especially during bidweek.  I know there are others who deserve thanks
in addition to Dawn, so please let them know we appreciate their hard work as
well.  I don't want to seem greedy, but I'll ask anyway.  When do you think
we will be able to get the Sitara number entered in the Link field in Tagg?
Also, can we get the Tagg number entered in SCI?  Thanks again.
