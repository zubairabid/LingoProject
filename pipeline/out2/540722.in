Jennifer,

I spoke w/Jenny Rub about almost every BMC/EBS issue, except for this one.  I
did not know about the issue which Bruce Smith has sent (blue text, below) to
Jenny and Bob McAuliffe.  When I spoke w/Jenny, I was unaware of BMC's
retraction.  It is new news to me, and at the very least, doesn't seem very
"customer-focused" on BMC's part.  I certainly agree w/Bruce's statement to
the effect that BMC needs to meet w/Philippe about their pricing!
