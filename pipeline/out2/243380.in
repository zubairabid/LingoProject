Hello everyone,
Here are some updates since our meeting and some follow through points:
1. Today I received access to lotus notes and instructions on how to use it
for the purpose of tracking our agreements.  this should greatly improve the
efficiency of our work on this project.
2. I received confirmation that on Monday that we should have final drafts of
the Raymond James and Robertson Stephens Brokerage Agreements ready for
signatures.  Sam is preparing the accompanying documents for R/J.  Stephanie,
can you prepare those for R/S?  R/S is a high priority agreement.  Thank you.
3.  This morning we finally received comments from Jefferies & Co.  I will
review them on Monday.
4.  Psytech Analytics, an added high priority agreement, was sent to Sheila
Glover for final execution.
5. I got written confirmation that ING Barings was executed, from their
perspective.
