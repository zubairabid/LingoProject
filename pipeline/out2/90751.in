The Portland West Desk needs two new traders added to EnPower. I believe
you're the correct person to contact for this, but please let me know if I
should talk to somebody else. We'd like to have our mid-marketers enter their
own trades now, and many of them already have the IDs to do that. Two
marketers - Paul Choi and Greg Wolfe - do not. I know that when I took over
the Deal Control position here John Forney contacted you to help me acquire a
trader ID, so I'm hoping you can help me with this task.

Thank you,
