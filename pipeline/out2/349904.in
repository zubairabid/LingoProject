The California Power Exchange (Cal-PX) has responded to subpoenas from
several federal and state bodies investigating the price surges that hit
California's wholesale market this summer, according to state officials.
FERC, the California Public Utilities Commission, the California Attorney
General, the California Electricity Oversight Board and auditors from the
Joint Legislative Audit Committee of the California State Legislature are
currently conducting investigations into electricity deals and pricing
practices in the wholesale energy market during the summer. All of the
agencies have issued different subpoenas demanding the release of documents
pertaining to market conditions and participants.
A Cal-PX spokesman called the subpoenas "no big deal" and said they are
served to protect the confidentiality of the information given to the various
agencies. Information about specific marketers and their methods could be
detrimental if it were released to the public, the spokesman added. Attorneys
for the Cal-PX have been cooperating with the different bodies conducting the
investigations. Initially the agencies had announced they would work together
on their investigations, but the need to issue separate subpoenas for the
release of information demands that the bodies proceed individually. In
addition, some of the agencies have needed to issue more than one subpoena to
receive different records, contributing to the paper trail arriving at the
Cal-PX.
