Hi Tana, I noticed that the trades that we need to assign from Dynegy Power
Marketing to Dynegy Marketing and Trade were all November trades.  The
settlements group will be doing their download tonight for November
business.  Do you think I can change these trades to the correct name today
or should I wait until the assignment is fully signed.
