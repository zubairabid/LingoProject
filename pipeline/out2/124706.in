Dan-

This attachment reflects the initial comments by Coleman's Attorney back in
September.  Due to the substantial revisions, we did not pursue utilizing any
of their changes, but instead asked them specify their primary points of
contention.  Although it took four months, I believe the fax refers to our
request.

Let's discuss.

Thanks.

Dan
