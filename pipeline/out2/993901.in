QUALCOMM Extends Mitsubishi's CDMA License for 3G CDMA

SAN DIEGO, Dec 12, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- QUALCOMM Incorporated (Nasdaq:
QCOM), pioneer and world leader of Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
digital

the

manufacture and sale of subscriber equipment for third-generation (3G) CDMA
(i.e., cdma2000, WCDMA and TD-SCDMA) and 1xEV (HDR) subscriber products. Under
the terms of the amendment, Mitsubishi will pay QUALCOMM a multi-million
dollar
license fee and ongoing royalties at the same rates for 3G as those for
cdmaOne(TM) equipment, irrespective of the licensed CDMA standard.

"QUALCOMM is pleased to add Mitsubishi to the growing list of licensees that
recognizes the value and significance of QUALCOMM's CDMA patent portfolio in
the
development of third-generation voice and data communications," said Steve

working
with Mitsubishi as it makes significant contributions to the 3G CDMA market."

QUALCOMM has essential patents for the WCDMA standard and has now licensed
some
or all of its essential patents to more than 30 companies to manufacture WCDMA
equipment. Each licensed manufacturer has agreed to pay QUALCOMM the same
royalty for WCDMA as that licensed manufacturer is paying for other CDMA
standards, including cdmaOne and cdma2000. Some of the companies now licensed
to
manufacture WCDMA equipment include Advantest, Agilent, Alps, Ericsson,
Fujitsu,
Glenayre Electronics, Handspring, Hitachi, Hyundai, Kyocera, LG, Lucent,

Sony, Tektronix, Toshiba, Willtech and other Japanese and Korean licensees
expected to be announced shortly.
