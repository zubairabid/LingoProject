I had the same reaction.  We didn't get much of a break between the January
and February meeting!  Was it car care and car safety that we had planned for
Feb?  And do we have a volunteer to host the meeting?  I could certainly host
if needed.  Did you have a constable or someone in mind to talk with the
girls about car safety?  I would be glad to call them and make arrangements
if you let me know.  Any ideas on car care?  Seems like Joy Martin mentioned
her husband as a possible "expert" there.  Or should we try to call Firestone
or Jiffy Lube or one of those spots to get a speaker?  I am headed to Calgary
for Wednesday and Thursday this week, but can make plenty of phone calls
before I leave.
On nominating committee, I have a list of offices held over the years by the
girls that will be needed by the nominating committee.  I would be glad to
meet with the girls on the committee either Thursday night (I land from
Calgary around 6:00 pm), Friday night or Saturday.  I can get you this list
if you need to meet with the committee before then.  It may be tough to get
the girls together, but am I correct in assuming that they need to present a
slate at our Feb meeting and then they vote in March?
The symphony open rehearsal sounds good - 10:30 am on Saturday, March 31; buy
tickets at the door ($4).  Problem is that SAT's are given that day.  Meagan
is signed up to take them.  I wonder how many others may be taking the SAT
that day?  If there are only a few conflicts, we could go ahead and it's okay
if Meagan misses.  If we have a lot of conflicts, then this may not work.
Maybe we could get Merritt to e:mail this question to the girls when she
contacts them about this weekend's meeting.  They could check their schedules
and then we could get a count.  I will also look into other possible dates
and get availability and prices on tickets just in case.
