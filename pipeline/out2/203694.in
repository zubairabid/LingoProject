On July 1st, Project Apollo and Beyond launched its final SAP implementation.
Enron now has an integrated, common financial, human resources, procurement,
and project management system throughout the majority of Enron's businesses.
By far Enron,s largest SAP implementation, this &go live8 added approximately
8500 new users ) raising the total user population from Apollo and Beyond
implementation efforts to over 13,000 Enron employees and contractors.

A highlight of this implementation was the rollout of eHRonline, an
intranet-based system that enables individuals to manage their personal
information and time management activities plus view their pay information
and benefit elections.  This new system gives the power and capability for
managing your information to the person who knows the most about it ) YOU!

The Apollo and Beyond solution will yield savings of over $30 million per
year plus provide increased speed and accuracy of information.  Once
post-implementation efforts have been successfully completed, the focus will
turn to system support, enhancements, and additional projects to help
leverage Enron's SAP system for increased growth and profitability.

Many thanks to the HR, financial, project and procurement communities for
their efforts towards the vision of +One Enron,!
