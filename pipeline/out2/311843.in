John:
On Tuesday, January 30, 2001, selected business units within EES will be
sharing their business and marketing plans for 2001. These plans incorporate
the lessons learned from last's year activities. The Bear Trap program was
initiated two years ago to help our Origination teams filter down the
universe of prospects to those offering the best probability of closing
deals.
This year we will have the most comprehensive Bear Trap session ever.  We
want you to be part of this exciting process and to broaden the relationship
we have with you and your teams.  Come and join me on Tuesday, January 30th,
at the Aerial Theater in Bayou Place, downtown Houston, starting at 7:00 AM
with breakfast and continuing until 5:30 PM.  If you have not RSVP'd yet,
please have your office call Julie Davidson at x- 36882 to confirm your
attendance.
See you there.
