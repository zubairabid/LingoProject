Weekly Update (11/10/00)

College football season is winding down, which means a busy month for
Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly and the Texans'
scouting staff.

Casserly visited Texas A&M and the University of Miami this week before
returning to Houston Friday for facility and scouting meetings. He plans to
attend tomorrow's game between top-ranked Oklahoma and the 24th-ranked
Aggies in College Station. Next week, Casserly will continue his Big 12 tour
with a venture to Nebraska.

Leonard Shapiro of The Washington Post featured Casserly and the Texans in
his weekly NFL notes. Click here to read the story:

Casserly will join Texans Owner Bob McNair in Austin Monday for a reception
at the home of Austin resident Lowell Lebermann.

"We're looking to extend our fan base all over southeast Texas and Austin is
a vital part of our push," Casserly says. "Football is a very important part
of the Austin community. We can offer their fans the best stadium in this
country, a new beginning and a team that they can grow with."

McNair is coming off a successful weekend at the Breeders' Cup in
Louisville. His filly Tout Charmant took second in the Filly & Mare Race
last Saturday. Tout Charmant can now boast six wins and nine second-place
finishes in 21 career starts. Next year's Breeders' Cup Championships will
be at Belmont Park.


More than 400 women attended the Houston Texans' first Football 101 Workshop
for Women this past Saturday at Foley's in downtown Houston.

The event was hosted by KTRK/ABC-13's Debra Duncan and KIKK 95.7 FM's Lisa
Dent. In a workshop setting, the group learned about life in the NFL, the
history of football, strategy, equipment and officials' signals. Texans
Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly was the featured
speaker, joined by Hall of Fame safety Ken Houston, former Oilers wide
receiver Haywood Jeffires, Texans Director of Pro Scouting Chuck Banker,
Associate Director of Pro Scouting Bobby Grier, Associate Director of Pro
Scouting Miller McCalmon and former NFL referee Red Cashion.

KTRK taped the event and will air a half-hour Debra Duncan Show devoted to
Football 101 Saturday, Dec. 23, at 6:30 p.m.
