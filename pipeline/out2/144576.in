Robert,
A contact at Merrick is Ralph Townsend.  He's the manager of engineering over
their oil and gas group.  He's at (303) 751 0741.  As far as the scope of
work is concerned, we could use the exact same wording used in the Forerunner
agreement with the only exception being their scope was limited to just the
House Creek project. Please let me know if you need anything else.  Thanks
