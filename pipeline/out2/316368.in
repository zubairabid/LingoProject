Hi Kathleen,
I want to get Laura Luce to direct us to give Gregg signing authority.  As
you know, the request for Ben came from Janet, not Ben. I'll check with her.
do you have the LLC agreement to see how changes are handled?  If not, you
can get a copy of my copy.  It is not a standard agreement.
On the CA, please make the effective period two years from the latest
disclosure of info, and the disclosures will be ongoing. I don't have the CA
in front of me, but does it say that Peoples has to get their consultants to
sign a CA as well?  It is a good question.
Ta ta for now,
