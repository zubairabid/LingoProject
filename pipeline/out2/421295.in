Bob:

Our issues with hedge funds are somewhat complicated.  The threshold issue is
that they are severely limited by their fundamental documents (the prospectus
will spell out what they can invest in) so we have to review those documents
before trading.  That is more than we do for run-of-the-mill domestic
corporates and takes a lot  of legal resources that so far have been spent
elsewhere.

The other issue is more difficult because it is hard to peg down and relates
to regulatory uncertainty.  About a year ago a major hedge fund (Long Term
Capital) got into serious trouble and the regulators stepped in,
orchestrating a bail-out.  There was much wringing of hands and gnashing of
teeth in Washington afterwards and since then there have been a variety of
messages coming out of Washington relating to derivatives trading with hedge
funds - none of them good.  Our view is that the regulators will be paying
much closer attention to hedge fund trading of derivatives than in the past
and we don't want that spotlight shining on us.  [In case you're interested:
notwithstanding their name, hedge funds are speculators.  Much of the federal
regulation of derivatives has assumed that hedging -- as opposed to
speculation -- was safer and therefore more palatable.  The failure of a
large hedge fund might result in damaging ripple effects throughout the
financial markets.  Hence the regulators' heightened scrutiny.]

For both of these reasons, when EnronOnline was launched it was with the
internally stated policy that we would not give access to hedge funds (or
individuals - for similar reasons).

Commodity Trading Advisors can not trade on EnronOnline on behalf of their
customers just as Brokers cannot.
