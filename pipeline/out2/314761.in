Bob/Kay:

Thanks for your help last week with these ComEd LOI's.

Janet signed the documents Friday afternoon and we faxed a copy of each to
ComEd.  ComEd will use the electronic versions below to generate executable
copies on their letterhead and send them back to me.  I will bring them up
for initialling once I recieve them.
