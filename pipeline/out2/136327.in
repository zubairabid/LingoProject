I just got back after spending the day at jury duty.  I was one of 60 that
had to go through voir dire.  They picked up to juror 43 but I do not think
they would have gotten to me.  I am sure that I was struck by the defense
counsel.  This was a criminal case and it appears that their would be some
type of mental capacity test.  The defense attorney asked the 60 of us if the
government should provide mental health services for those who could not pay
for them.  This immediately rankled my Republican blood and I raised my
hand.  I was the only one who did that.  Call me heartless but I am now in my
office instead of hearing how the devil made him do it.
No word on the Supremes.  I think the longer they take the worse it looks for
Gore.  If they knew that they were going to find for Gore they would have at
least lifted the stay with some parameters on how to recount.  The longer it
takes the less like The Goreinch will not be able to steal our Christmas.
We are freezing our butts off down here.  It is in the 30s and we may have
some sleet or freezing rain tonight.  That is enough to shut down this city
for a week.  Nothing what you are used to up there.  We enjoyed having you
over the other night.  Mary and I were glad that you put us on the list for
your traveling circus.  Tell Sandra to come on down.  It is really not that
bad.  And the stock price is back in the high 70s.  We have money again!
