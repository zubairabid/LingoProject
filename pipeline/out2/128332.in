A draft of a Master Firm Purchase/Sale Agreement was sent via Federal Express
Monday to Thad Shumway of Cinnabar for review.   I left a message this
morning for Mr. Shumway and await is call.
If Cinnabar agrees to the Master, we will accept a fax of their signature on
page 5, and follow with originals for execution.  Dan Hyvl  informed me you
will contact Cinnabar today as well.
I will advise you of our progress.  Please let me know if I can be of further
assistance.
