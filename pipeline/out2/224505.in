In regards to this trade, I talked with the trader, Randy Degner, about
their confirmation.  He is in agreement on using our omnibus confirm since
their confirmation was incorrect as far as referencing a Master Agreement .
He would like to see if someone can speak with JoAnn Goza (316) 828-7169 in
their Wichita office to establish a Master Agreement between KCI and ECT.
Thanks
