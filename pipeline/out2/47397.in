signed a definitive agreement with Daishowa North America Corporation to

ENA West Power commenced construction on its 225MW Fountain Valley Power
Project.  The project, located in Colorado Springs, has an 11-year fixed
price PPA with Public Service of Colorado and is being funded off-balance
sheet in the Turbopark funding vehicle.   The west power origination team
anticipates closing the sale of the project to a third party in the second

Lumber Origination and Trading
From an origination standpoint, the group has executed a number of long-term
financial and physical transactions since March 2000.  The lumber group has
grown to 10 people including 3 physical/cash lumber traders with a combined
total of 50 years industry experience.  Currently they are trading 1500-2000
transactions per month.  Additional cash traders by Q2 will substantially
enhance the cash desk.  Financial trading activities include both derivative
transactions and a substantial position in the futures market.  Increased
liquidity in both financial and physical trading will lead to more structured
transactions.
