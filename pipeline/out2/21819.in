As part of our commitment to responsible business practices around the world,
we have recently launched a Corporate Responsibility function at Enron.  The
further development, implementation and ultimate success of this effort will
depend upon the participation and coordination of the business units and
regions.
To that end, we are launching a Corporate Responsibility task force, which I
will chair.  The roles of this task force will include developing and
coordinating social and environmental policies, strategy, and information
among the Enron business units; monitoring alignment of business activities
with corporate responsibility goals; and providing a forum for business units
to share issues and develop a consistent strategy.  Kelly Kimberly, Senior
Vice President of Corporate Responsibility, and also of Marketing
Communication and Public Relations for Enron Broadband Services, will lead
the overall corporate responsibility initiative.  Additionally, because of
their interest and experience working on these issues, Paula Rieker, Mark
Schroeder and Rob Walls have already volunteered to represent their
respective business units on the task force.
As a leader at Enron, I am seeking your participation, support and
leadership.  I am asking the head of each business unit or major corporate
function to either participate personally or designate a VP-or-higher level
individual to serve as a member of the task force.  I look forward to your
organization,s participation.
The first task force meeting will be in Houston from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m.
Please choose one of the dates listed below, note your designee, and respond
to Stacy Walker by Tuesday, September 19, by fax at 713-646-3248, or by phone
at 713-853-3583.  Additional details, such as an agenda and a meeting
location, will follow.
