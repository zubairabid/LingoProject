Stan.  Per your request, here is the update for the first three Year 2000
Goals and Objectives for ETS.

1.  We obtained our FERC certificate, completed construction on the Ft. Myers
lateral, and made initial deliveries to FPL at their plant on October 1.

2.  We have obtained a very favorable Preliminary Determination on our Phase
V project, in spite of having significantly revised the filing on August 1 to
include TECO in the Phase V project.  FERC staff is working on issuing our
Environmental Impact Statement, which has been delayed due to the TECO
filing.   We remain on target, however, for timely receipt of our certificate
to allow construction by the second quarter of next year.

3.  Mr. Hayes and is team are continuing negotiations with prospective
shippers for a Phase VI project.


If you have any questions, please call me.
