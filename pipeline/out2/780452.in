1. Rick,  are you the person to prepare the schedule?

2. It is not  readily apparent to me that we necessarily should feel under
any obligation to"show cause" that we are not in default , although a civil
non-inflammatory reequest to discuss the issue would probably have been well
received..it seems to me that if we grovel now in a defensive and reactive
manner it keeps them with the initiative (Q. Do we really think they are
prepared to throw the dice and declare the default?)

3.  How much was paid for the interests is none of their  #$@%& business.

4. What Limited Waiver Agreement?  Did I get a copy? I can't find it in my
email.
