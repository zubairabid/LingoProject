This past Wednesday eveing, the cocktail party in honor of the National
Audubon Society,s Living Ocean, held at the home of W. Graham Arader III at
1016 Madison Avenue, was a stellar event, drawing a crowd and raising
awareness.  The focus of the event was the launching of the &Just Ask8
campaign, aimed at protecting the creatures of the sea by expanding consumer
awareness about food from the ocean.  Attendees sampled delicious recipes
from some of the top US chefs, all of whom used fish recommended by the
&Seafood Lover,s Almanac,8 a beautifully designed, whimsical guide to fish
and shellfish that serves to help consumers become more familiar with the
seafood they eat.
.
Edited by Ms. Mercedes Lee (with Suzanne Iudicello and Dr. Safina
contributing), the Seafood Lover,s Almanac provides readers with crucial
information regarding sea life: what is safe to eat, for example, and which
species are endangered.  Many seafoods commonly available today are much
less plentiful than the average consumer might think.  Consumers hold the
greatest influence over the buying decisions of seafood wholesalers and
retailers, and with the efforts of the National Audubon Society this issue
will have a much greater chance of receiving widespread attention.

America,s top seafood chefs (and their spectacular creations) were in
attendance, including Rick Moonen, of Oceana, New York; Todd English,
Kingfish Hall, Boston; Jonathan Eismann, Pacific Time, Miami; Robert
Kinkead, Kinkead,s, Washington, D.C.; and Terence Feury, Striped Bass,
Philadelphia.  The sampling of food ranged from Margarita Oysters to
Dungeness Crabcakes with Chipotle Vinaigrette, Sesame Seared Tuna with
seaweed salad, pickled ginger, wasabe and fried wontons, all served up in an
irresistible fashion.  Best of all, the chefs generously shared their
recipes to all who whished to recreate these delicious appetizers at home.

Other notable guests included Jennifer Bogo, Associate Editor for The
Environment Magazine; Barbara Fairchild, Editor and Chief of Bon Appetite;
Mindy Fox of the Earth Pledge Foundation; Jennifer Herman of Martha Stewart
Magazine; Ray Isle, Senior Editor of Wine & Spirits; James Rodewald, Senior
Editor of Gourmet; and of course, Graham Arader, a long time supporter of
the Audubon Society, who would not have missed the event for the world.

The evening was permeated by celebration and enthusiasm for the new &Just
Ask8 campaign: a wonderful sign that support for the Audubon Society and all
of its fundamental projects continues to grow.  Please do not hesitate to
