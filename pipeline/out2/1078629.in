His name was Keith Corbo.  He graduated with us and went to Texas A&M.  He
was is a fraternity Beta Theta Pi.  He dropped out and moved to Florida and
worked at a bar(his dad had moved their).  The last time I talked to him was
when he was in Florida in 1992 or 1993.  I can not find him anywhere.  He
would definitely be in our senior year book.

I will try and put something out there today and I will get some pictures to
send as well.
