Vince has asked that I forward the following:

************************************************************************

We will begin a seminar devoted to the book on "Energy
Derivatives", written by Clewlow and Strickland, every first and
third Friday of each month, beginning  January 19th.  Stinson
Gibner has volunteered to act as the seminar coordinator.

On January 19th only, the seminar will be held in EB30C1.
Every session thereafter will be in EB49C1.  The seminar will be
conducted like a "brown bag"  (everyone bring their own lunch).

The seminar is mandatory for every member of the group who
started after January 1, 2000.   However, all other members of
the group are invited to participate.

The books have been ordered and hopefully will arrive by the
day of the first meeting.
