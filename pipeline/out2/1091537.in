You're right...that sounds just like Becky.  At least no one's sick this
time!!  I can't believe Zach ran the car into the house.  And equally amazing
is that Emily finally finished high school.

I still haven't heard anything about Chicago.  I finally got the name of the
HR rep here in Houston, so I'm going to begin the irritation tactic shortly.
I'll just call every few minutes until they get tired of hearing their phone
ring and finally answer.  And if that doesn't work I know where this lady's
office is so I'll go pay her a friendly visit.  I'm determined to find
something out.

Talk to ya later,
Robin
