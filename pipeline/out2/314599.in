My understanding is that the ABB equipment will most likely be used somewhere
other than Calumet due to the noise issue.  It is possible that LM 6000's
will be used on Calumet, resulting in a re-bid of the EPC contract.  However,
none of this is etched in stone, and their are active discussions with
Peoples about what to do.

I suspect this isn't much help. Paul probably has better information.
