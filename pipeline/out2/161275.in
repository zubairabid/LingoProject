Jeff:

It looks like Tim Stamnitz, CEO of Global Photon, could schedule a meeting
at 3PM on either July 5 or 6 at their office in San Diego.(One American
Plaza,
600 West Broadway, Suite 1200, San Diego, CA  92101.

I could attend either of these times as well.  We will need to finalize the
NDA before financials are disclosed, so probably that will all happen at the
meeting if we get the NDA worked out over this coming week.

As I indicated, I will be in Denver next week, but can get voicemail and
email.

Jim
