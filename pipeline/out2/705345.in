Kenny, as you may know, there were 9 environmental applications submitted
to various local, state, and regional agencies requesting approval to
initiate this project and most of the requests apply to crossing the bypass
channel.   As of today, we have received one approval, and that from the
State Fire Marshall, Office of Pipeline Safety granting us a waiver so that
we can lay the pipe above ground as opposed to below ground.  I have calls
into  the other agencies  for which applications and requests were
submitted but have had no reply.  I would caution that we might get into
trouble for initiating a construction project without consent and approval
from a particular agency, as agencies many times look at an entire project
even though their jurisdiction may only apply in one specific area of a
project.  This is particularily the case in air permitting where an
applicant can not even construct a road or bring in construction materials
until the air permit is issued.  Because this is my first project in
California, Id like to be sure of this and make follow up calls to all
agencies for which applications and requests were submitted and verify that
we can initiate the construction, as long as we dont impact a specific  or
strategic portion (ie  the bypass channel)  for sometime down the road when
we are well into the project.   Ill call you tomorrow and let you
know.......
