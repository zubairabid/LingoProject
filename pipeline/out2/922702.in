Sally,
As you know, we have been working to find new ways to improve Unify Logistics
functions.  A major step has now been achieved by installing TIBCO and moving
it into production today.

Utilizing TIBCO in conjunction with our other enhancements will enable
Logistics to obtain real time updates from both EOL and Sitara without having
to re-retrieve them from the database.  This will automatically update
Scheduler screens with new deals as it comes without action on their part and
also reduce required database access.  This has been achieved through great
team work between many groups including Logistics Schedulers, Unify IT
Logistics & ADE, UNIX and Network people.    Please let me know if you want
to know more details.   Thank you.
