I have forwarded to you via one of our assistants a copy of the standard
Timber Harvesting Agreement that has been offered to me by Southern
Timbergrowers, our chosen contractor, for work that we desire to begin
immediately.
Assuming that HPL has some type of pro forma agreement that would better fit
this situation, I tried to mark-up their agreement indicating some of the
features at a minimum that we would desire from this business arrangement.
Please could one of you (Gerald is receiving the walk-up copy) get back with
me with some type of draft agreement within the next few days that I can take
to ST in order that we may begin the evaluations that we have before us?  I
would very much appreciate your attention to this.
Thanks!
Candy
