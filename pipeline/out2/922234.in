Where are we at?
We should be able to ask more specific questions in our follow up evaluation
to get better data on what specifically they don't like about the reporting
out of SAP but as a rule so far we have consistently heard the issue of
management quality reports, ability to pull data from across modules (ie. HR
and PS data) and I can't get the data the way I want to see it therefore I
don't understand what the data is telling me.

This last point will be helped by these workshops (ability to view the data
in mulitple ways) but only to the extent where people use the tools available
and spend a little time to work with the system.  The design sessions
(upcoming) should help address some of these questions aswell - one big
learning from this has been that the majority of users do not understand
their business unit design or the overall design and therefore can't figure
out what the system data is telling them.  This is being addressed in the 7/1
training plan and will also be addressed in the long term reporting strategy.

Thanks, again if you have any questions please contact Melissa, Greg or
myself.
