It seems that Wood is going to have a PD on the agenda implementing the
Alpert Davis Bill. A draft has not yet been released. see below for a summery
of items of interest.

Electric
SDG&E Bill Cap: This decision provides an expanded rate stabilization plan
for ratepayers of San Diego Gas & Electric Company, retroactive to June 1,
2000.  This plan applies to residential, small commercial, and street
lighting customers, including those customers defined as "general acute care
hospitals" and customers defined as public or private schools for pupils
serving grades
K-12, and all accounts on Rate Schedule AL-TOU.  This decision also
establishes a voluntary program for large commercial, agricultural, and
industrial customers.  The accounting procedure for tracking these costs and
revenues is clarified.
PAP: This decision adopts a uniform PX credit adder of .007 cents/kwh for all
three utilities.  This decision finds that it is unreasonable to exempt
wholesale customers from paying their fair share of Reliability Must-Run
costs. RAP applications shall be filed annually.  The next PX credit
adjustment application shall be filed in 2003, if necessary.
RAP Alternate: This alternate order is the same as the Proposed Decision,
except that it adopts a PX procurement credit of 34 cents per kwh.
PG&E Billing Implementation Delay: The record lacks support to penalize PG&E
for delay in implementing weekly calculation of the Power Exchange price
attributable to computer information system upgrade problems.

SoCalGas Montebello Gas Storage: This decision conditionally approves the
settlement reached between SoCalGas and the Commission's Consumer Services
Division.  First, the $3,495,000 voluntary monetary contribution SoCalGas is
to make for the benefit of certain organizations should instead be paid to
the General Fund of the State of California.  Second, SoCalGas should expand
the scope of its ethics course to address a utility's ethical obligations in
exercising the power of eminent domain
