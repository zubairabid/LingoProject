In non-default situations the Lenders allow the banks to have rights and
typically substantial input on waivers modifications etc.  As you can imagine
the IFC would not want the liability of being responsible to B banks if they
changed the deal without their consent and the B banks would e uncomfortable
turning over that right to a third party.  They would lose control of the
credit process.
