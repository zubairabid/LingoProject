There was a big computer virus spreading a few hours ago and we all had to
totally shut down our computers.  Supposedly this virus was all over the
world.  Maybe we'll hear about it on the news.

I have a meeting set up with IPI next week to demonstrate their system to our
Global Contracts team leader, the Confirm Desk financial trading head, and
also Mark Taylor.  Right now I'm working on a summary listing what I think
our system issues are.  I've traded phone calls with Documentum.  I'm
actually trying to get this summary done, so I can send it to them to show
them what areas we may be looking for help in so they can focus their
presentation on our specific needs.  I've looked at your material for Micro
Modeling.  I will be contacting them next.

I've got our third paralegal trained, and she's getting up to speed, so I'm
getting down to the last contracts I'm trying to resolve.  I have another big
project that ends this coming Wednesday, Thursday I leave for Germany for
vacation for two weeks, and I hope when I get back to devote my somewhat full
time to this project finally.

So that's my story, how are you?
