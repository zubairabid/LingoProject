Meet the head of
the leading firm
in our business

Imagine the opportunity!
Imagine that the leading energy company in the world has picked you to run
the
company that it expects to be the leading retail energy company in North
America.

So you get a sharp competitive edge in the back room, you recruit IBM as a
co-owner
assuring you the lowest cost per customer by a factor of two or three.
To get your foot in 27 million doors you recruit AOL as a co-venturer with a
commitment from AOL to promote NewPower,s wares.
You do an IPO and take in about $700 million for working capital.  The IPO is
over and the quiet period it required.
But the most important silver spoon -- so that you get your energy at the best
price and to protect you against price spikes -- you get up front 30
Enron-trained
risk managers and traders.  Can you imagine having to recruit them?

To make sure this team is run by the optimum chief they picked Eugene
Lockhart,
most recently president of Consumer Services at AT&T and before that president
of BankAmerica,s Global Retail Bank with its consumer, commercial and small
business
banking services delivered through 3,000+ branches.
Now, Lockhart's talking about his plans.
Restructuring Today had lunch with Lockhart Thursday and reported in
detail:

*  How NewPower intends to actually start up the retail industry?  What is
the
heart of NewPower,s business plan?
*  How they'll make money in markets where margins may seem too thin.
*  How he,s going to have 600,000+ customers next month and easily a million
by the end of 2001.
*  What percentage of their sales come from the NewPower website.  What
figure
is he using for cost of customer acquisition?
*  Lockhart plans to have by the end of the first quarter or at the latest
the
second quarter 750,000 customers making them by far the largest unregulated
retail
marketer in the US.
*  How does he think utilities will compete with the NewPower paradigm?
*  What marketshare do they expect to get at first and then by 2005?
*  What does he see as his biggest challenge?
*  Why is this a good time for NewPower to invade California markets?
*  Why will NewPower succeed where Enron failed?
*  What,s the role of backward dating in forward market margins?
*  Where NewPower gives a 20-25% discount on the commodity portion of a bill,
what kind of margin can it make now?
*  How do higher prices help NewPower?  "We,re actually in a very good
position
given (that) the gas cost increases perversely will work in our favor ... "
*  "We have a 10-year, exclusive agreement with IBM whereby we can issue a
bill,
collect the money and care for a customer at lower cost than anyone else in
the
industry by several orders of magnitude."

We,d love to send you the two-story, detailed report on how the leading
company
in our industry is going to get there and stay there.
