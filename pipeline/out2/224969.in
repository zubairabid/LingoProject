Don Black has suggested we get you in the loop on the below issues we are
seeking answers on. We have some pending financial transactions that we would
like to work through all the Brazilian mechanics before proceeding. Your
primary contact down here for this issue will be Maria Ines Granado. Please
provide us with your comments as soon as possible so that we do not encounter
a transactional conflict.
Gustavo thank you for all your work to date we will keep you briefed to make
sure we have your input. Please follow up on the Tozzini issue we discussed
to make a final decision on their input.
Thanks
MFG
