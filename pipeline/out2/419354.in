NYMEX BOARD EXTENDS PROPRIETARY FEE REDUCTION PROGRAM

This will confirm that at its meeting on October 4, 2000, the NYMEX Board of
Directors determined to extend the current Proprietary Fee Reduction Program
through December 31, 2000.

Pursuant to the Program, Member Firms and individuals members who own seats
will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 24 cents per round (12 cents
per trade side).

Individual members who lease their seats, or hold a membership under an ABC
Agreement, will have their NYMEX Division fees reduced by 5 cents per round
turn (or 2.5 cents per trade side).

Clearing Members who clear Member Firm trades should adjust their billing
systems accordingly.

Clearing Members clearing floor members, accounts should not adjust their
billing systems for such individual members.  NYMEX issues payments directly
to individual members based upon their trading activity.

Floor members who execute Type 3 trades are asked to pay special attention to
NYMEX Rule 6.18 (B) (ii), requiring the executing member to report the alpha
code (badge symbol) of the receiving member on PTS.

Should you have any questions regarding this matter, please feel free to
contact M. Dawn Lowe or Donna Talamo at (212) 299-2370.
