I have scheduled a conference call for Tuesday, May 9, from 3:00PM-5:00PM to
discuss our rebuttal testimony on the Comprehensive Settlement Agreement that
is due on Friday, May 19. I know many of you are still recovering from the
direct testimony (which looks fabulous, compelling and persuasive) but we now
need to focus our attention on rebuttal. Call in number is 1-800-720-5846
Confirmation number is 6185854.

I'm looking for feedback on the best approach to rebuttal and I have a few
suggestions. First, I would like to limit the testimony to witnesses who
have already filed direct testimony. Unless we absolutely need to add
additional witnesses, my preference is to stop while we are ahead. Adding
more witnesses will make it increasingly difficult to convince the ALJ that
the panel approach will work. Second, although this is rebuttal testimony,
it is not typical rebuttal. ALJ Biren reserved this rebuttal for parties
opposing settlements to state their case. In as much as we can work in
issues that are objectionable from direct, we should do so. Nonetheless, we
should try and focus our testimony on those things in the Post-Interim that
are objectionable and inconsistent with the Commission's Most Promising
Options. I would use all of our "powder" on the Post-Interim arguments and
limit our opinions on the viability of the Interim (at least some of the
Interim signatories will take this approach). We will also need to address
issues raised by PG&E, Long Beach and others, but it should not take up a lot
of ink.

I would like to portion out the assignments to the Post-Interim as follows:

SoCalGas  Historical reply to reasonability of capacity
contracts, assignments, and step-downs
SoCalGas  Shareholder risk/reward; consistency with the Global
Settlement; ratepayer sharing
SoCalGas  Montebello
SoCalGas  Information disclosure
ORA   Gas Accord as the appropriate regulatory policy model
Dynegy/Watson/Enron Unbundling transmission benefits all customers,
especially electric generators; RMRs
and Edison
WHP/WGS  Storage unbundling
TXU/Shell  Core capacity unbundling; self-balancing
GreenMountain  Failure to address retail issues

I am not suggesting this is a comprehensive list and if I have missed
something, speak now. I would like us to get our first draft out to parties
no later than noon Monday, May 15. Sorry folks, but we're running out of
time.
