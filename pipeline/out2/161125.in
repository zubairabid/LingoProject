Hi Jeff,
Make sure the access to the network is defined as DS1 access...We would like
DS3 access pricing because that is the minimum level of service we trade at
today.  Also, please indicate that the current available capacity is about 1
OC3, (the current OC12 network is running about half full and the ISO wants
about an OC3 of overhead capacity with which to scale their customers'
demand.  We need to determine the interval between the time the ISO requests
the upgrade to OC48 from MCI and the time that upgrade would be made
available...California OVER estimated the number of users...

Just a thought, but the ISO might be able to get MCI to reduce the Yearly fee
they charge by waiving the right to the upgrade.  MCI would have to spend a
significant amount of $ to do the upgrade.  Also, MCI is losing $ on those
access loops.  If the ISO were to threaten to request 2000 loops that MCI was
going to lose $100,000 per month on, MCI might reduce their charges if the
ISO were to reduce the open call.
