The sailing might be fun, and the price is right.









The Main Bed & Breakfast Inn

General Information
Welcome to The Main Bed and Breakfast Inn, located in Palacios on the scenic
Texas Gulf Coast. Nick and Kathy Nichols are the innkeepers, and your hosts
for enjoying the sights of Tres Palacios and Matagorda Bays. The Inn is a
German Gothic-style stone house, built in 1917. From it,s spacious front
porch to the sun room at the rear of the house, particular attention has been
given to preserve the character and authenticity of the structure. Gracious
archways join the foyer, living and dining rooms, polished hardwood floors
run throughout the main floor, and attractive, comfortable furnishings
complete the scene. The modern conveniences include central air conditioning
and televisions in each room. Six accommodations are available to guests: two
rooms in the main house, each with private baths and private entrances. One
is appointed with the innkeepers memorabilia of their home in Colorado, the
other with momento,s from their life at sea. Two bungalows are available,
separate from the main house. These have accommodations for families,
including a full kitchen and tiled shower. Each bungalow is air conditioned
and has a television. A one-bedroom apartment with a spacious living room and
full kitchen, can accomodate family groups of four. The last accommodation
available is our sailboat, Papillon, which is described below. Whether you,re
looking for a place to relax (try our pecan tree-canopied back yard) or play
(the beach, seawall and fishing piers make for a good time), The Main Bed &
Breakfast Inn will make your stay in Palacios a memorable one. Come see us!
