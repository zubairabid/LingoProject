Yo sista,

Sorry I've been so MIA.  You know how it is: move to a new city, lack the
money to buy groceries or put roof over head let alone purchase a calling
card.  I am enjoying my internship and even starbucks (it's kind of fun!),
but I am DEAD broke and trying to figure out how to pay rent this month.  So
I guess nothing's new . . .

Outward Bound is nice.  The "office" is an old renovated house about six
blocks from my apartment, which is a godsend when it snows (which it did
today, a lot).  The people here are generally really mellow - I'm sure you
can imagine.  Lots of "bro!", "dude!" and "no worries!" like we're
Australian surfers or something.  I actually heard somebody call some slides
(as in picture slides) the "slidey-slides" the other day.  But they're all
super nice, and I have my own desk and phone and voice mail, so I feel
important.  Starbucks is pretty fucking funny (again, use your imagination).
Everyone I work with is tall, skinny, male, goateed, and painfully in the
closet.  And you should hear the crap that people order - they actually have
a CODE for "half-caf" now.  Idiots - do you even know what actual coffee
tastes like?

So I heard you're moving in with Molly and Amber.  That should be fun.
Honestly, Kate, I love it here, but I think I'll be back sooner than I
thought.  I'm starting to think I could be really happy in Portland.  But
you can't beat the weather in Denver - it's sunny practically everyday!  And
the guys here know how to buy pants that fit properly over their shoes.  You
have to visit!  Our apartment is big and we could go out with Monica and it
would be really fun!  My phone number, by the way, is (303) 777-7132.  So
call me if you ever get those free long distance thingies that cell phones
tend to get.  Okay, let me know the gossip in p-town.  Love, anna
