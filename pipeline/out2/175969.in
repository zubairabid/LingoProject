Thanks, Harry.  I want to re-enforce the switching issue, since EES is likely
to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on Tuesday.
Switching would certainly reduce EES' going-forward exposure to 1) growing
"credit receivables" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that
the Commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the PX credit with
it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing
conference on Wednesday.  Reducing that exposure is clealry important to EES.

But the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be
significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on Enron
meters.  Imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the
"complex process"  of changing-out the meters.  In addition, when CA border
gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch
from noncore to core service on SoCalGas' system.  SoCalGas submitted an
emergency motion at the Commission to prevent the switching and the
Commission granted it in the wink of an eye.

It will be important for EES to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of
all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching.  Otherwise, we may
find ourselves confronting a lot of negative PR without having reduced any of
EES' exposure.  Customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the
utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned
negative on ESPs as a result.

Best,
Jeff
