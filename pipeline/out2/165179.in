For those WPTF members who are interested in followingthe  interruptible OII
at the CPUC, ALJ Mattson issued a ruling yesterday concerning  future filings
and the scope of the matters to be covered in them.
This ruling clarifies that respondents and parties should not delay making
proposals on curtailment and other issues. He directs that, "respondents
and parties should, within seven days of the date of this ruling, file and
serve  proposals that address each of the four items in Ordering Paragraph 1
of the  Rulemaking, including curtailment issues:
(a) "the role of customers on  a utility,s interruptible tariffs to ensure
reliable and reasonably-priced  electric service in California, especially
for the Summer of 2001;
(b)  coordinate the variety of interruptible, curtailable and demand
responsiveness  programs being offered and proposed in California;
(c) identify  alternative means for customers to reduce their energy usage
during periods of  peak demand; and
(d) "to revise and update the Commission,s priorities  for curtailing
customers during times of energy shortages." (R.00-10-002,  Ordering
Paragraph 1, page 15.)
Further, to the extent proposals filed  December 4, 2000 do not address
improved curtailment notification measures,  respondents and parties may file
and serve additional proposals. For  example, respondents and parties may
address the feasibility, desirability and  cost of creating phone banks or
using electronic mail to notify customers before  curtailments (e.g., rolling
blackouts). Comments on proposals filed and  served seven days from today
may be filed and served within seven days after  proposals are filed."
A copy of the ruling is attached for your information.
