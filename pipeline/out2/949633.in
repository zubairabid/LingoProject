Hi, Christe

Thanks. The objective of the meeting with Jeff Shankman is to use his powers
of persuasion
to make sure that John Arnold and Louise Kitchen can make   presentations to
the Tiger
Team. We can also talk to them  about getting some other people from their
units to make presentations
to the team.
