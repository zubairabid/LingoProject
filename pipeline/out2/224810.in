As a result of our recent reorganization, we are continuing to refine our
corporate structure to best support our business.  The corporate Human
Resources function is very important to our company,s success.  To reflect
our commitment to a strong Human Resources function, we are naming Cindy
Olson as executive vice president of Human Resources and Community
Relations.  Cindy will report to the Office of the Chairman, and she will
join Enron,s Executive Committee.

Cindy will coordinate with Rick Causey on key issues, primarily
compensation.  With the expansion of our global businesses and the
acceleration of our financial activities, Rick will focus on the leadership
of Enron,s accounting and financial reporting activities, as well as
overseeing risk management systems, Y2K preparations and our SAP
implementation.

Given our rapidly growing communications business and the enormous potential
to further develop that business, Enron Communications will require its own
HR resources.  To support that need, Rocky Jones will move to Enron
Communications as senior vice president of Human Resources to focus on the
staffing and HR needs of our communications business.  Rocky will report to
Ken Rice and Joe Hirko, co-CEOs of Enron Communications.

Cindy,s current responsibilities of diversity and community relations will be
combined in the new HR organization.

We are confident that these organizational changes will strengthen our
corporate support of our business functions.  Please join us in
congratulating Cindy, Rick and Rocky on their new responsibilities.
