Governor has NOT signed AB 1156, $150 million from the general fund.  He HAS
signed AB 265 (SDG&E rate cap bill) and AB 970 (expedited siting for
non-permanent peaking).
I had a conversation today with Wayne Sakarias from SDG&E about
implementation.   It appears, based on the press release, that the Commission
will act tomorrow to adopt an order that will begin the implementation
process, although the order is not available for review yet.
I asked Wayne how they intended to implement the bill.  He believes that the
opt-in provision for large C&I customers, and any associated undercollections
associated with the customers that opt-in, would be handled separately from
the general application of the rate cap for residential and small commercial
customers.  I asked how they would collect any shortfalls.   It didn't sound
like they had a plan yet.  I suggested balancing account treatment for the
customers that benefit from the opt-in with any shortfalls recovered as
quickly as possible but no later than 1 year.
Relative to Res/Small Commercial:
He said that SDG&E will propose, in response to ARM comments, that the cap
(for res and small commercial) customers would not disadvantage DA
customers.  In other words, they are concerned about the appearances that
SDG&E's rates would be lower than market prices because of the cap and would
make available to DA customers a comparable pricing mechanism, that in
effect, would eliminate any pricing advantage by staying w/ SDG&E.
For example:  If prevailing market prices were 7.5 cents/kWh, SDG&E's res and
small commercial customers would only be charged upto 6.5 cents, and DA
customers would receive a 1 cent/kWh credit against their T&D charges so that
in effect, there is no economic advantage to staying w/ SDG&E.  However, when
it comes time to pay the piper for undercollections, DA and bundled customers
would again be treated comparably.
Their BIG concern is that the Commission will hang them out to dry on
reasonableness.
We agreed to keep the dialogue open.  Things will likely happen quickly.  If
folks have any recommendations or see problems with the above, let me know
asap.  Thanks.
