FYI, John Grass and  I spoke to Curt Hribernik  this morning regarding
various issues in the Master.  There has been a change in their corporate
structure such that it appears they may  have stronger financial backing or
at the very least a change.    I requested they send documents reflecting
ownership and name change.   Curt  indicated they would be able to provide a
LC.   I told him he and or his credit dept. would need to discuss these
issues with you before we could continue.

I will send you information when I receive same.
