1. Should we mention their ability to exercise subrogation rights and the
effect it may have on our counterparties?  This is really not a risk as much
as it is a relationship issue.

2. With respect to Section 6.1(a), based on last night's conversation, I
doubt very much that they will remove the reference to counterparties.  They
really feel that this is a risk taht we should bear given our relationship to
the counterparties.  Bill is speaking with them about this issue this morning.
