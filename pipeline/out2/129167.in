Dear Debra,

Some like it hot. For the rest of us, there's winter. Whether your
pleasure is skiing, snowboarding, or just getting away from it all in
a place where people appreciate the colder months, Travelocity.com
can help you plan your winter vacation. (Hoping to escape the cold?
We can help you with that, too!)

***FEATURED THIS MONTH***

Ski for Free in Switzerland!
Want to win a one-week ski vacation in Zermatt, Switzerland, the
country where winter sports were invented? Then enter now for your
chance to shred the slopes of Switzerland for free this season thanks
to Switzerland Tourism and Travelocity.com.

Boston
Boston's Colonial charm and youthful energy don't shut down in the
winter--the snow only accentuates the old-world beauty of this
historical city. And speaking of snow, you'll find that the city's
location makes it a great place to base a skiing or snowboarding
vacation--major New England ski and snowboard resorts such as
Killington, Mount Snow, and Sunday River are a day-trip away. You get
the crisp northern outdoors by day, and the cosmopolitan pleasures of
New England's largest city by night.

Vancouver
Vancouver, too, is a great place to visit if you're looking to
combine urban pleasures with a skiing or snowboarding vacation. You
can stay in the city itself, since the world-renowned Whistler Resort
is only 75 miles away. Or, save yourself the drive and stay near the
slopes--the Chateau Whistler has world-class accommodations. Either
way, you're never far from western Canada's most exciting city and
some of the best skiing in North America.

Travelocity's Been There
Ask a circle of friends their thoughts about Las Vegas, and you're
likely to get a mixed response. My friends either love it or hate it,
and it tends to be the same elements that incite both reactions: the
high rolling glitz and noise of the casinos. Personally, I've always
enjoyed the people-watching and the great array of restaurants and
other attractions (or distractions!) Las Vegas can offer. We've
already been there...and you can go there too! Been There! from
Travelocity.com features real stories by real people (our own
hardworking, travel-loving employees) who've been to great
destinations! Read about our adventures then make your plans to
go there too!

***DESTINATION GUIDES***

Vail
Vail has been synonymous with skiing since the 1960s, and is still
rated the best ski area in the United States by many polls year after
year. With 4,000 acres of skiable (and boardable) terrain, 25 chair
lifts, and a wide range of terrain, it's no wonder this huge mountain
remains popular. And unlike some ski areas, the town of Vail is a
destination unto itself, with sophisticated shopping, dining, and
entertainment options to keep even complete non-skiers happy.

Sydney
Want to escape winter for real? Then head down under, where summer is
getting going as the first chill gusts of winter blow through the
Northern Hemisphere. Sydney's an exciting place to visit any time.
And with Olympic tourists long gone, and the weather getting
beautiful, now's a great time to discover the opera house,
picturesque harbor, world-famous Bondi Beach, and more.

Taos
Located in the beautiful Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Taos is
different from many ski towns you may have visited. Many have the
dining and entertainment options that Taos (population: 5,000) has,
but few can boast of having a cultural scene quite like Taos. For
over 100 years, the town has attracted a growing number of artists,
drawn by the distinctive light, desert beauty, and supportive
community. Today, about 15 percent of the town's permanent residents
are artists. In addition, the rich cultural traditions of the area's
Mexican and Native American populations would make this a fascinating
vacation spot even if it weren't for the nearby Taos ski area--one of
the best in the Rockies.

Switzerland
For a winter getaway with a European flavor, Switzerland is the place
to be. The Swiss Alps are home to many ski/snowboarding areas, and a
wide range of resorts--you're never too far from the mountains in
tiny Switzerland. Towns such as Zermatt and St. Moritz are where
you'll find the classic upscale European ski-resort experience. Not
to worry; you'll also find more modest areas sprinkled among the
hyper-glamorous ones. The country's famous cuisine, shopping, orderly
cities, and picturesque mountain scenery are year-round treats, and
enough to keep anyone busy all vacation long.

Florida
Hate snow? Love sunshine? Think "winter wonderland" is an oxymoron?
Then visit Florida this winter. The sunshine state is warm and sunny
year-round--and surprisingly affordable, too. From the trendy good
times of Key West to the stately charms of historical Pensacola and
white-sandy Sarasota, Florida is the continental United States' own
tropical getaway.
