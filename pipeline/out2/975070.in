John makes a good point about Bain
One of their senior partner recently wrote an article in the italian
largest financial newspaper where he provides (subjective) arguments
that none of the most recently developed  methodologies can be used
for valuing hith tech firms
Moreover (and surprisingly) he concludes by saying that "...the
value of an high tech firm is like the beauty at the lover's eyes"!!!
