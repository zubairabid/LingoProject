Following the California Energy Crisis?
When "Crunch" Time Comes This Summer,
Don't Be Without The Latest News and Information

EEI's State Restructuring Service has expanded its coverage of the California
Energy Crisis and put all its email Action Alerts and a new Chronology of
Crisis events in one place on its Web site.  As part of your subscription to
the State Restructuring Web site, you get:

A continuously updated chronology of crisis events
All laws responding to the crisis, including important regulatory and court
decisions
Legal, financial, grid operations, federal, and regional perspectives
E-mail notification of noteworthy events

Updated as policy actions and operating events are reported, this is one
resource you don't want to miss as the crisis heads into the summer!

EEI's State Restructuring Service continues to be your one-stop electronic
resource for complete information on all the other states that are
restructuring, including those that are delaying their processes out of
concern over California's experience.

Consisting of access to our Web-based resource and an e-mail alert service,
this yearly subscription provides you with timely briefs on important state
regulatory, legislative, and judicial actions, full analyses of the most
important policies, and comprehensive background on existing policies of
restructuring states.
