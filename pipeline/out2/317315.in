Ben:

See the email below from Rebecca to Catherine Clark.

Rebecca informed me a few minutes ago that Catherine is planning to speak
with Peter Anderson (ESA Corporate Finance) and make it clear to him that ESA
is responsible for paying the Execution Amount (already determined in the
Agreement) plus the interest cost ($21,500 per day) until the day on which
funding occurs.

If the transaction closes & funds tomorrow as expected, ESA's interest
payment will be based upon 28 days.  If for some reason the funding is
delayed, ESA will be responsible for the additional interest cost until
funding occurs.  Catherine believes that if ESA delivers their notice to
close [as expected] by 9:30 am tomorrow morning, then there is a high
likelihood that closing and funding will occur tomorrow.

Rebecca and Catherine believe, and I concur, that this information is best
delivered verbally directly to ESA's finance person (Peter Anderson).

Call me tonight at home if you wish to discuss.

Fred
