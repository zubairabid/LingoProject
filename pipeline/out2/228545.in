Market Axess:

The online trading platform launched during August, focusing initially on
investment grade bonds.  Based on restrictions their dealers imposed on
potential users, we have agreed to defer our involvement with the site until
high yield trading is introduced during the 4th quarter.   Would you prefer
that we resolve issues with Market Axess' legal agreements now, or that we
wait until we are closer to the date we begin using the system ?

Buy Side Direct:

I will be out of the office tomorrow.  Should we meet Tuesday or Wednesday to
discuss the feedback you, Jason and I received today from their attorney ?
I'm open Tuesday between 9:30 and 3:00 or Wednesday before 4:00.

Thanks.

Mike
