Dave:

As per my voice mail, I'm planning to set up the conference call for
Wednesday morning.  I will send the demo to Milbank, Canadian and Japanese
counsel for them to review in conjunction with their research for us.  From
our preliminary advice, I believe that we will need to structure the game
similar to the format in the demo to avoid liability in various jurisdictions
for violating trademark restrictions on the use of the terms Olympics, Sydney
2000 and the like.  We will be able to offer the games to most US residents
as well as those European residents for which we received the green light
during the Euro2000 research.  We should also be able to offer the game to
Japanese residents so long as the prize has a value no greater than 100,000
yen.  We will not be able to offer the game to residents of Australia or
Singapore (see David Minn's e-mail below re Australia).  I am waiting for
final word on Canada.
