SGT Reyna,

Definitely a good idea -- and one that EBS has flirted with a couple of
times.  In early '99 the Network Development group sent me out to meet with
military facilities managers along our proposed fiber route from Houston to
Jacksonville.  I had a few good meetings, stocked up on cheap class six
liquor, and reported back some interest from the Navy.  Unfortunately there
was not much follow up from our sales folks (though it did begin our
relationship with NASA).

6 Months later a new vertical was set up at EBS to sell services to federal
agencies, including the DOD.  The group piggy-backed their efforts with Enron
Federal Solutions - the EES-esque vertical to outsource energy to military
bases.  However, because of much legislative and regulatory uncertainty (Bob
Frank can elaborate) the EBS tie-in never really took off with the EFS
business.

The upshot?  I think there is still a viable business there, especially if we
can demonstrate massive cost savings to the DOD through our trading
organization, but EBS has never fully engaged in a focused effort in this
area.  The only way I see EBS at this point doing any significant deals with
the DOD is if they create a better team - with federal government knowledge
and a handle on military-speak to pursue these deals, or if EBS "falls into"
opportunities through origination leads that come from our group  (much like
the U.S. Space Alliance-NASA leads) or through ENA/EES.   A good idea --
difficult to execute.

Thoughts anyone?
