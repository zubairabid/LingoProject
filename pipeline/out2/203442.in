Over the next few weeks, Project Apollo and Beyond will conduct its final SAP
implementation ) this implementation will impact approximately 12,000 new
users plus all existing system users.  SAP brings a new dynamic to Enron,
enhancing the timely flow and sharing of specific project, human resources,
procurement, and financial information across Business Units and across
continents.


This final implementation will retire multiple, disparate systems and replace
them with a common, integrated system encompassing many processes including
payroll, timekeeping, benefits, project management, and numerous financial
processes.

Employees will be empowered to update and/or view their personal information
via the intranet-based eHRonline -- a single front-end to SAP's Self Service
functionality and Enron's Global Information System (GIS).  Among other
things, individuals will be able to update personal information (including
W-4, addresses and personal banking information), manage their individual
time using a new time entry tool, view their benefit elections, and view
their personal payroll information on-line.
