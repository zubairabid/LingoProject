Dear all,
Please remember, each Business Unit  (BU) will be responsible for generating
their own distribution list based on the Business Objects report that will be
put into the HR repository tomorrow.    Please let Kathy Schultea and myself
know  immediately  the name of your one point of contact for each BU and/or
function.  Kathy Schultea will notify them when the report has been put into
the repository. You should begin validating your participant list on Monday
September 11th.

Kathy  or a member of her staff wil be available should you need assistance
in generating your individual reports.   I can be reached at 31477 should you
have questions.
