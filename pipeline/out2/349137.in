Oops. My computer sent the message before I was finished.  I continue to hope
that there is more opportunity than risk in this for us.  Price volatility is
in the news like never before and our main product is price risk management.
I know that the inquiries are up, I hope EES and ENA can get some sales out
of it.  More utilities have been approaching TNPC, EES and ENA about taking
over their merchant functions.  On the policy side, we are working the issue
on both a state and federal level.  Whether this country does anything
meaningful to deal with the current crisis comes donw to one person ... Linda
Breathitt.  Ken Lay spoke with Secy Richardson and Sen Schumer about
proposing rulemaking initiatives to FERC.  We are working the RTO process
hard elsewhere in the country and coming up with messages to arm our
remaining allies around the country.   THis is the biggest time for us on
this issue since the very beginnings in California and New Hampshire.  In the
current panic, however, we will be decimated if we are associated only with a
move to keep price caps from going into effect (I saw your message to Mona).
I am going to read the comments next, but I start off thinking we need to
avoid running headlong into the price cap movement; we may be better off
trying to co-opt the movement to get broader reform.

Hang in there.
