I will go ahead and send a couple of copies off to you -- it doesn't seem
like their website has the picture.  Yes, it is funny that we are back in
Berkeley -- and so close to where we used to live.  We were very hesitant
about moving back here, but I am very surprised by how much I like
it.  Berkeley is a weird place and I continually see faces that I recognize
from 20 years ago.  I am glad to be out of Noe Valley though -- that was a
bit over the top.  At this point our house is an eyesore and a very cold
one a that.  It is a great old place though -- built in 1906 and we are
only the 2nd owners -- that is amazing.  I love the election!  and I really
love Katherine "I am ready for my close-up" Harris.  She is such a
freak.  As of today it seems like Bush is going to be able to grab it.  For
God's sakes where is Al Haig when you need him?  He must be dead otherwise
he would be in control!  OK Babe -- I am off -- I would love to see you and
your gal -- maybe over the holiday season we can arrange to bump into each
other -- a little irish coffee somewhere?
yours,
tc
