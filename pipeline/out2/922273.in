The Aquila issue has been largely addressed: the killed deals have been
primarly due to one trader there-Par O'Kane, and I've spoken with him on
this. I think this will resolve the problem. The Kock issue seems to be a
hardware issue on their side, and I spoke with the head of IT/b to b there
and she assured me they are trying to resolve this issue.  I offered one of
our tech guys to visit their shop.  Jeff
