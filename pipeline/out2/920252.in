Dear Shawn,

It is unfortunate Tom did not bring up these points when the three of us
discussed this on Monday.  I am unclear as to whether the work AA was
planning to do on power is for their internal or external purposes as when
asked directly Jennifer Stevenson said that it was for both audits (which, as
you know, is frowned upon by the SEC).

In fact, Stacey was not part of the Doorstep team.  Additionally Risk
Operations (myself) did not set up or perform the deal test.  Instead, this
test was set up by AA and performed by members of RAC.  This can be
considered a internal audit for AA's purposes.

Although it seemed that we had an agreement on Monday, it now looks as if
you, Tom and I need to meet again and establish some additional ground rules
in order to eliminate duplication of work.

Regards

Shona
