I hope that there is no more confusion!
The opening of each brokerage account should require two signatures for
control purposes.  ONE of those signature MUST BE either of Ted Murphy or
Rick Buy (their titles frequently change but check the Enron Corp. corporate
workbook).  The SECOND signature MUST BE an officer of the entity opening the
account.  We suggest the level of authority used by ENA but certainly
whatever appears in the entity's unanimous consent or resolution authorizing
the opening of brokerage accounts.  I think that Marie previously sent you a
form.  Let us know if you have any questions.
What is the timing on the Enron Brazil Power Holdings XII Ltd. account?
