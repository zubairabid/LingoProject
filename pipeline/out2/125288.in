Attached is the revised confirmation.  The changes made were to the Maximum
Daily Purchase Quantity, the Transportation Capacity Credit, and the
Transportation Capacity Release, as well as a few minor clean ups for
consistency.  Please provide any additional comments needed and may I ask one
more time to make sure the Transportation Capacity Credit is worded properly.

Thanks for your help and making time for me this morning.  I am also sending
this to Chicago in order for Peoples to have their legal review it also.  I
am also going to visit with credit, but if you know of anything credit wise
that should be in here, please let me know.

Thanks,

Steve
