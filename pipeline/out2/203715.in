Good news:  I've just received word that the FERC has issued an order denying
SoCal's request for rehearing of the Gallup order.  FERC also ordered that
TW's request for rehearing (which asked the Commission not to require TW to
disclose discounted rates) is now moot because we filed a discount report at
the time required by Section 284.7(b)(6) of the Commission's rules (as we
always do).

If SoCal is still feeling vindictive, they can file an appeal in the D.C.
Circuit.  I believe their window is 60 days.  In any event, the pendency of
an appeal would not affect the validity of our certificate.

If you have any questions, let me know.
