Debbie,
Below is the termination payment as calculated by the Structuring group.
This is the amount we should use when notifying Cage of their payment owed
ENA.  I think we should send a letter out to them with the amount owed to
ENA.  I do not know if it is necessary to mention the draw on the L/C, which
we have received.
Thanks
