Dan,
Per Debra's e-mail to me, why can we not include other entities on this
guaranty, it seems we have got guaranty's in place with other counterparty's
in which they reference specific contracts as well as entities not related to
the  contract, i.e. Sempra, Duke, Aquila, Dynegy,......
Dan,
I see the execution of this contract as a priority considering the trading
volumes on Enron Online and current market conditions.  I know in the past,
we have been unable to negotiate a Master Firm with Engage US, although their
legal group is fully aware of our request to negotiate a contract. Please
send the draft out to the contact listed on the credit worksheet and
priortize the negotiation of this contract.
