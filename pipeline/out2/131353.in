Regarding BC Utility,  I have discussed a GISB with Mr. Wong  and  we have
been unable to come to agreement  due to their choice of law restriction.
Because they are a utility they are by statute required to bind agreements
subject to  British Columbia.   Conversely as this would be an agreement
subject to state laws of Texas as well as the United States,  it will not
work to agree to British Columbia as jurisdiction for this contract.

Please let me know if you have any questions, or I can be of further
assistance.
