Do you want to be on the distribution to see the daily Excel Spreadsheets
when they have Japanese counterparties for approval?  For online, what I
daily do is send my new counterparty lists to each of the relevant trading
legal groups.  Each of the legal trading groups has one day to respond or I
will consider their products approved for the counterparties on that day's
list.  I have been giving the approvals for Japanese counterparties.
Currently, I am approving them for all products (with the only restriction
being on bandwidth, where they can only trade the US segment, which happens
to be the only bandwidth products we have opened online so far!).   I
understand that when we offer Japanese based products the approval process
may get more complex.
Saying all that, do you want to be on the list for the daily approvals, or do
you want me to continue to respond for Japan w/o running it by you?
