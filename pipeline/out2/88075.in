BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
OIL PRODUCTS
Congratulations to the US Oil Products Trading Team!  On October 4, 2000 they
successfully completed a deal with a volume of 2,400,000 barrels with a
Notional Value of $80,640,000.  This is the highest Notional Value associated
with an EOL trade.
Kudos again for another great deal. They have done another large
crack-spread, this time for 100,000 barrels per month for calendar 2001. This
trade notionally values out at over $40 million and is the second largest
transaction conducted to date on EOL.
STEEL
Steel Trading and Origination teams, headed by Greg Hermans and Tim
Battaglia, respectively, have already defined a Hot-Rolled coil financial
product.  The contract has been drafted and is currently being discussed with
customers.
Financial Hot Rolled Steel will be posted on EnronOnline, allowing the steel
industry to hedge their price exposure for the first time in history. The
access to hedging products will help the steel industry manage technicalities
and smooth cash flow.  Over time, forward price curves with transparent
pricing should allow the steel industry to also benefit from improved access
to capital.
The next challenge will be to educate the steel industry about financial
swaps and derivatives as risk management tools.  The $300 billion steel
market should provide an excellent growth opportunity for Enron.
PRINCIPAL INVESTMENTS
FuelCell Energy, Inc. recently announced that it has entered into an alliance
with ENA.  FuelCell Energy and Enron will work together to develop and market
FuelCell Energy's Direct FuelCellc (DFCc) products.  In connection with the
alliance, Enron has invested $5 million in the common stock of FuelCell
Energy.  Additionally, FuelCell Energy will issue warrants enabling Enron to
purchase up to 1.3 million shares of FuelCell Energy common stock.
Fuel cell developer Dais-Analytic Corp. also announced an alliance with ENA.
As part of this alliance, Enron has made an equity investment in
Dais-Analytic and will support market development, distribution and other
field services for Dais-Analytic's fuel cell, humidity control and related
products.

these changes have on interest rates and currencies.  We also monitor other
key markets, with a special focus on oil, and its impact on consumer,
producer and equity prices. The International Monitor can be found on the ENA,

NEWS FROM GLOBALFLASH
Enron Launches Financial Plastics & Petrochemicals Derivatives on EnronOnline
Enron is to start trading a new range of financial swap contracts for the
plastics and petrochemicals industry on www.enrononline.com, the company,s
free, real-time Internet-based trading platform. This is the first time that
these derivative products, designed to help clients better manage the price
volatility which characterises the multi-billion dollar industry, have been
made available on the Internet in Europe.
Gas Deliveries in Germany
Since 1 October 2000, Enron has been the first and only non-incumbent player
to be able to serve customers within Germany by delivering gas to three local
utilities, those of Heidelberg, T_bingen, and Bensheim.  Carsten Haack who
closed the first deal with Heidelberg and was in charge of negotiation of the
transport did mention that the procedures are still complicated and lengthy
and that the terms and conditions for future agreements will need to be
easier, more transparent and standardised. Helge-J_rgen Beil from the
Frankfurt office who closed the gas deals with the municipalities of T_bingen
and Bensheim said that these deliveries are encouraging but do not guarantee
the future yet.   Another positive aspect is that Enron's continental gas
trading team was able to do the first gas trade within Germany with some of
the gas Heidelberg contracted for but could not take on.
Liquid Fuels Group Launches Tanker Freight Forwards
Scott Moncrieff, a director in the group, has with his team introduced tanker
freight forward contracts on to EnronOnline, to offer a standardised hedging
contract in today's highly volatile tanker market, currently worth in excess
of US$ 10 billion per annum.
And on the Dry-Side......
Pierre Aury, Chris Connelly and their team introduced a similar on-line
forward freight swap in June and to date, have traded contracts with a
notional value of US$ 8 million, equivalent to 20 million metric tonnes of
combined physical and financial contracts.  The routes are  from Colombia and
South Africa to Rotterdam, which are key routes for coal transport.
