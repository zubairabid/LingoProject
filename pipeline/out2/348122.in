Steve,

For our conference call on Monday, I thought it would be useful for you to
have this.  The summary is pretty much the same, except that the shopping
incentive for commercial customers increased by 5%, however, that is still
not enough to make it work for us.

Under the stipulation, the dollars FE is to receive are not quantified and my
sense is that FE probably got very close to what they asked for.  Their
request was for $6.9 billion net of deferred taxes (the number they used
publically); however, with the deferred taxes added in, this becomes $8.7
billion.  The recovery period for the CTC is Dec. 31, 2006 for OE, June 30,
2007 for TE and Dec. 31, 2008 for CEI subject to the usual caveats.  The
total transition revenues on a net present value basis is $9.1 billion and in
nominal dollars, $12.3 billion.

In calculating their transition costs, FE used a rate of return for the GTC
of 15.38% for OE, 13.15% for CEI and 13.13% for TE.  For the RTC, FE used a
rate of return of 14.59% for OE, 12.67% for CEI and 12.66% for TE.
Thus, I believe the recovery is overly generous.  It seems to me that it
would be worth exploring a PECO-type solution here.  Under the settlement, it
is highly unlikely that a competitive market will emerge in the next 8 years
or that we will be able to compete.
