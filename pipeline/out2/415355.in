I continue to say "no" for financial because they are not an eligible swap
participant.  For a counterparty to become an eligible swap participant if
they are not one in their own right, they would have to post an up front
letter of credit fully covering their trading PRIOR to doing any trades.  So
this ball is in Credit's court.
