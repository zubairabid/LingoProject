Dear R^2:
I would like you to consider the following in determining the appropriate
course of action in your mission to ensure that all our offices have process,
procedures and policies to adequately support the business activities:

I believe that your going on a series of trips is precisely the wrong
approach and not only do I think it will be relatively unproductive (as
compared to your tremendous productivity at home base) but I honestly believe
it will be counterproductive. Here's why:

1) While you guys are on a plane or in a remote office, you will be less
in touch and available to make decisions at home
2) When you are preparing to go and de-compressing from having been, you
will be distracted, tired and attempting to catch up to all your     other
duties.
3) There are only two of you and many of them.
4) Please don't take this the wrong way, but I question whether you even
are the best qualified from a skill perspective (Kevin Sweeney,     Vlady
Gorny, John Vickers, et al might be the best to dig into the details)
5) When you guys are the face, it means the rest of us are not.  This
means that our presence and authority, which will be required on
an on-going basis in order for this to have lasting effect, will be
completely undermined.   Senior people need to know that if a
Sweeney, Murphy, Hardy,  etc walks into their office and finds something
not right, that it will be communicated up the line with     reprecussions.
If you were to investigate anonomously, I believe that a universal theme is
that stuff gets pointed out and nothing     ever gets changed.  It puts those
in the position of knowing on the defensive and sounding shrill.

My suggestions is that you stay home.  Sally, AA myself and others should
develop a template for consistent analysis of the offices and a plan to
maintain an on-going pressure and results.  Part of that plan would be a
requirement to report to you guys the findings and recommendations in a
concise way  with you following up to the heads of those offices about what,
if anything, needs to change as quickly as possible after the review.

The most important things you can do will be to pave the way for our
departure, be available to assimilate the findings and be prepared to
follow-up.  Everyone already knows that they need to respect your wishes.
They need to know (as do we) that we have your support and you will respect
and act on our recommendations.

Thank you for indulging me.  I am afraid that I am correct.
Ted
