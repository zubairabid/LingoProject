Group=Atlantic-Telecom, Convergent Networks, Efficient Networks, Polycom,

Networks, Sedona Networks, Sphere Communications and Texas Instruments Support
Move to Standards-based Deployment Models

RICHARDSON, Texas, Dec 13, 2000 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OpenVoB(tm) today announced
that prominent telecommunications technology leaders have signed on as members
of OpenVoB, effectively doubling membership of the open industry engineering
organization formed to accelerate the deployment of interoperable voice over
broadband technologies, products and services.

The new members of OpenVoB join the ongoing efforts of a broad-based group of
leading telecom, cable and wireless broadband network developers to eliminate
obstacles standing in the way of validated VoB solutions. The organization is
working to ensure uninhibited growth in the deployment of voice over broadband
networks through the cooperative development of proven, multi-vendor
architectural options and interoperable platforms for implementing industry
standard VoB technologies.

The first of these implementations and test plan models -- the "D1" GR303/AAL2
BLES model for VoDSL systems based on the ATM Forum AAL2 Loop Emulation
Service
-- was tested at the group's inaugural OpenVoB CallFest(tm) held the week of
Nov. 27-Dec. 30, 2000 at the University of New Hampshire InterOperability
Laboratory in Durham, N.H. This first CallFest was a controlled, "working
engineer-only" event structured to create a secure, cooperative test
environment
in which senior product development and test engineers are free to address
critical interoperability issues between products and platforms being readied
for deployment.
