Indeed - I have thought of you SO much.  Actually, if you can get a hold of
a copy of last weeks Economist, they have pretty much put their finger on
the situation.  I am well, and I'd love to see you and debrief.  Check your
calendar and let me know what lunch/morning tea might work for you next
week.  Monday's are always bad, and any time after 2:30 is bad.  Week after
next is pretty good too.  I hope you are doing something creative and non
political at Enron.  (I was NOT surprised when Ken Lay appeared as "Bush's
energy spokesman" before what's his name was confirmed...)  Let me know what
works....  G.  (and yes, rereading your note, I will give you a call.  Too
much rushing around today, but perhaps tomorrow.....)
