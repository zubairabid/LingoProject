Yes, these numbers are the posted volumes according to their bulletin board.
Update, as of 01/23...PG&ETop is 699 (61%), SoCalEhr is 1195 (96%), and
SoCalTop ios 538 (100%).  These volumes are slightly above last week's
posting.  I was told that the board was the official source for throughput
information; but, I will see if there is another source.
