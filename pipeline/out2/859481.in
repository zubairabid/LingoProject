CHIP SHOTS


Every year since 1983, Texas has lost or tied a game in its first four games
of the season. That means UT has had a blemish on its record each of the past
17 years - usually before Texas-OU weekend.

Orangebloods spend winter, spring and summer discussing the impact of new
recruits, the prowess of future opponents and the talents of its returning
starters. They spend money on season tickets, airplane tickets and alumni
luncheon tickets. They dream big dreams, and then by October, the high hopes
have usually come crashing down.

Only three times since 1983 has Texas opened the season 3-0: 1984, 1985 and
1994. Those starts were then immediately followed by either a tie (1984) or
losses (1985 and 1994). In each of those seasons, Texas ended up with four
losses.

In UT's two best seasons since 1983, a 10-2 campaign in 1990 and a 10-2-1
run in 1995, the Longhorns lost their second and third games of the season,
respectively. Before Texas can dream about winning a national title, the
Longhorns have to show they can make it into October without a loss.




Longhorn Q & A
Q: Judging from the Stanford game (as well as the last three games of last
season) it looks like the trend of blitzing the Horns will continue. There is
also no respect for our running game from any team that we face. I think the
best way to end this strategy against us is to become the aggressor on
offense and not sit back passively and react to what the defense is giving
us.

In order for us to achieve this, I think it starts with us putting our best
athletes on the field on offense. These guys may not be the most experienced
players, but they will gain experience with playing time, and they have the
ability to make a team pay for selling out with the blitz. It's time to start
Roy Williams and B.J. Johnson at receiver (along with Montrell Flowers) and
play a one-back offensive set. Our fullbacks are not a threat offensively and
Hodges Mitchell is not an I-back who is adept at following the fullback
through the hole. Hodges' strength is operating in space and making people
miss in the open field.

I also think Chris Simms needs to get the bulk of the minutes at quarterback.
Major Applewhite has all the intangibles in the world but Simms could (and
probably does) possess all of the same skills. He just hasn't had the chance
to display them. We desperately need to have all playmakers on the field if
we are going to turn this thing around. If not, I could see this season
slipping to 7-4 real quick. What are your thoughts, Chip?
The Jackson residence

BROWN:  With any unexpected loss, the tendency is to throw everyone out -
change coaches, players, even the bus driver. You do that and you are telling
this team that you have absolutely no confidence in them. There can't be too
much change at any one time. The big question is how the team responds to
this Stanford loss emotionally. Something tells me if Texas can find some
resolve and perform really well, you'll see some solid performances at all
the positions where problems currently exist. In 1996, Texas was No. 6 and
Notre Dame was No. 9. Texas had the game won in Austin and then lost. UT then
lost three of its next four, which included games against Oklahoma State,
Oklahoma and Colorado - all teams Texas is about to face after this week's
opponent, Houston.

That was a different coach and different players. But the common thread was
that Texas hit the top 10 and then choked. If Texas is hung over from its
loss to Stanford, trouble could be on the horizon. If Texas can find resolve
to show everyone that Stanford truly was a game in which everything that
could go wrong did, then I think the Longhorns will bounce back and be a hard
team to beat the rest of the way. Tuesday night Mack Brown said the Longhorns
are not a very good football team right now. The challenge has been made to
his team. If they come out and stink against Houston, every position will be
scrutinized, every coach, even the bus driver. There will be enough fire
being thrown in Austin to serve up grilled fajitas for the entire state. But
changes will have to be made constructively and gradually.

Chris Simms

Q: What's going on with the quarterbacks?
Mitch Golding

BROWN:  As the QBs turn. This week, it appears Chris Simms will start
because he was practicing with the first team on Tuesday. That has been the
trend. Whoever practices with the first team gets the start. Anyway, we'll
see how they respond after the Stanford game. Major Applewhite was erratic in
his play, despite almost leading the Longhorns back from the dead to a
miraculous victory. I'm sticking to my theory that the coaches want to see
what Simms can do against Houston before picking one or the other

to get solo duty in the Oklahoma and Colorado games.

Granted, if one struggles along the way, the other will come in. But Mack
Brown said they primarily went with Applewhite against Stanford because of
his experience and the fact that it was the team's first game on the road. He
said they still have all the faith in the world in Simms. It would seem to me
that it takes away the incentive to really take control of the offense, light
it up and get on a roll when you are alternating, but I'll continue to watch
like everyone else.

I keep trying to remind myself that Brown did this twice at North Carolina
with success. Of course, with those QBs (Oscar Davenport and Chris Keldorf),
Brown had different styles and gained an advantage by forcing the defense to
prepare for Davenport's scrambling and Keldorf's passing. With Simms and
Applewhite you pretty much get the same style. With Keldorf and Davenport,
you also had injuries dictate a few starts.



Q: Can you tell us what influenced Mack Brown's decision regarding the
quarterbacks against Stanford?
Nels Marshall

BROWN:  Here are Brown's exact words: "Experience. We were in a tight
football game and Major (Applewhite) has been around a long time. I was proud
- even with as poorly as we played offensively in the third quarter - that we
didn't panic. I thought that in the fourth quarter the kids did a great job
of coming back and giving us a chance to win. Sometimes youth doesn't look
like it is trying because they're nervous. Instead, they are trying too hard
and get uptight. Our team tried hard. As negative as people make Saturday
night, it is one of those things that you have to grow from."



Q: I'm glad we have two great QBs. My question is, are the receivers having
any problem adjusting to the different spin on the balls coming from a
left-handed or right-handed QB?
Dave Stastny, Austin

BROWN:  The receivers say the varying spins are not a factor when catching
the ball. They do, however, say that Chris Simms' ball will come a little
faster and a little harder than Major Applewhite's.



Q: The Longhorns are obviously going to play a lot of freshmen this year.
What are the rules on redshirting a player after the season starts? I know
that a player can apply for a redshirt for medical reasons, but can they also
apply for more eligibility or take a redshirt after playing a small amount of
time?
Chad Graham

BROWN:  No. Once a freshman plays in a game, even for one play and he does
not suffer a season-ending injury, the chance for a redshirt is out the
window.

Jermain Anderson

Q: Have the coaches given any consideration to moving Jermain Anderson back
to linebacker? If I remember correctly, he played LB in high school at Texas
City. He seems to still have good speed, but also a problem putting on the
necessary weight to play defensive end. It just seems like he might be better
suited for the outside linebacker rotation, especially considering the
progress made by young defensive ends like Kalen Thornton, Cole Pittman and
Adam Doiron.
Micah Hurt



BROWN:  Coaches don't think Anderson has the speed to play linebacker. They
are pleased with the depth at linebacker, as well. They like Anderson's
instincts as a pass rusher. They are still working on his ability to stop the
run.



Q: My husband wanted me to write and request that you put the Longhorn
football schedule in your letter each week. My husband, Mark, is a diehard
Texan who was transferred to Oklahoma in 1972. Through thick and thin, he has
remained a loyal Longhorn fan and taken a lot of harassment from the Sooner
fans. Of course, he does his fair share (and probably more) of bragging about
the Longhorns.
Barbara and Mark Harper

BROWN:  As far as the schedule, UT's remaining games are:

Sept. 23 (home) vs. Houston at 6 p.m. on Fox
Sept. 30 (home) vs. Oklahoma State at 11 a.m. on ABC
Oct. 7 (in Dallas) vs. Oklahoma, TBA
Oct. 14 at Colorado, TBA
Oct. 21 (home) vs. Missouri, TBA
Oct. 28 (home) vs. Baylor, TBA
Nov. 4 at Texas Tech, TBA
Nov. 11 at Kansas, TBA
Nov. 24 (home) vs. Texas Aat 2:30 p.m. on ABC
Since you all have access to the Internet, log onto UT's sports Web site
(texassports.com) and learn what radio stations broadcast the game in your
area. And you can read The Dallas Morning News online every day at
dallasnews.com.



Q: This may take some research but I was wondering if you could tell me the
number of UT players in the NFL and the status of some recent grads (i.e.
how's Cedric Woodard, Aaron Humphrey, Kwame Cavil). Thanks.

BROWN:  The Big 12 office just released a list of former Texas players in
the NFL. However, it includes some players who have been released. For
example, Aaron Humphrey was released after a free-agent tryout with Tampa
Bay. Chris Smith was released after a free-agent tryout with Washington and
Dallas. Jay Humphrey also was released after one year with the Minnesota
Vikings. Kwame Cavil made the Buffalo Bills after going undrafted. Anyway,
here is the list as provided by the Big 12:

TEXAS (21)
Ben Adams, OL, Miami
Taje Allen, DB, St. Louis
Tony Brackens, DE, Jacksonville
Blake Brockermeyer, OG, Chicago
Ricky Brown, RB, Cincinnati
Chris Carter, DB, New England
Kwame Cavil, WR, Buffalo
Phil Dawson, KS, Cleveland
Shane Dronett, DL, Atlanta
Priest Holmes, RB, Baltimore
Aaron Humphrey, DE, Tampa Bay
Jay Humphrey, OL, Minnesota
Derek Lewis, TE, St. Louis
Wane McGarity, WR, Dallas
Eric Metcalf, WR, Carolina
Dan Neil, OL, Denver
Roger Roesler, OL, Cincinnati
Chris Smith, TE, Dallas
Winfred Tubbs, LB, San Francisco
Bryant Westbrook, DB, Detroit
Ricky Williams, RB, New Orleans
Cedric Woodard, DL, Baltimore

Hodges Mitchell

Q: Don't know whether you can address any or all of these questions in your
column, but I've seen some unflattering trends in Mack Brown's program and
wanted your feedback. Mack Brown is a great recruiter, no argument there.
However, can he motivate? It seems like he can't get the team "up" sometimes
and can't adjust the team's mood during a game.

About offensive coordinator Greg Davis, I don't know who is responsible for
the offensive line but since it is an offensive group, in more ways than one,
I put it under him. With guys the size that UT has, shouldn't even Hodges
Mitchell be able to run? Who tagged Leonard Davis as a pro? Why does Davis
love Mitchell? Sure, he gained 1,300-plus yards last year, but how many of
those yards were "move

the chains" type of runs that allowed UT to hold the ball on the ground and
protect a lead? I thought it was going to be running back by committee but
all we have seen is the coaches continuing the same mistake - abandoning the
run and using the wrong back for the wrong situations.

Mitchell can run to the outside, but he cannot run through the defensive
tackles. And even if he does get holes, he still will never break through the
linebackers for a TD. Why not put Ivan Williams or Kenny Hayter back there
with Mitchell and go with a two-back, three-wide offense? You don't lose a
receiver as Hodges is a nice, smart receiver.

Other ramblings: Is Quentin Jammer really a corner? He got beat MANY time
against Stanford. I loved his hitting when he played safety but his injury
may have forever changed his game if he can't play safety and can't keep up
with opponent's wideouts.

How is the defensive end position shaping up? The defensive tackles were all
over the field against Stanford, but the DEs didn't make much noise. What is
up with the blocked punts? UT should be really, really embarrassed. Does
Stockton take too long? Is he too close to the line? Can the line block? Can
anyone at UT block?

Does Brown ride the officials who are missing holding calls? Several times
the camera caught clear holds by Stanford's line. Why on earth would you run
up the middle, on your own goal line against two of the best DTs you'll play
against?
Andrew Bowen

BROWN:  I think your feelings are shared by many Texas fans who are
incredibly pained, shocked, disappointed, angered and hurt by last Saturday's
events. But in talking to Mack Brown on Tuesday, he said it's fair to beat
the team up for not being able to run the ball. But he said to jump on any
other part of the team is to rip young, inexperienced kids who are still
learning what it takes to compete as a top-ranked team.

To be fair to Brown, he did say repeatedly that his team was overrated and
needed time to grow into some key positions - receiver, defensive end,
fullback and some positions on the offensive line and at corner. It probably
isn't fair to question whether Mack Brown can motivate because his teams did
beat Nebraska twice, Oklahoma twice and Texas Aonce. If a trend develops,
and Texas falls apart the rest of the season, there will be a fair question
about whether Brown did a good enough job of keeping his team's head screwed
on straight. But it's typical after losses to want to shred every part of the
team.

Brown said before the season that as soon as something went wrong, the
quarterback situation would be blamed. And he was right. The QBs are still
working hard, and look for Simms to start this week against Houston. There's
no question that the O-line is struggling, but so are the backs and so are
the receivers. Brown said only two of the five sacks were the fault of the
line. He said the other three were caused by miscommunication between
Applewhite and the receivers, causing Applewhite to hold the ball too long.

Mitchell was standing too deep in the backfield against Stanford, so it was
taking him too long to get to the holes. The coaches were not happy about
that. They were yelling at him to move up. He should only be 6 1/2 yards
deep. But he was sometimes at 9 yards. Mitchell also struggled with some
blitz pickup, which is uncharacteristic of him. So look for Victor Ike,
Hayter and possibly Williams to get a little time against Houston.

Coaches are still high on Jammer. Again, he hasn't played corner much in
games after moving from safety. But coaches are not thinking of moving him.
The defensive end position is a big concern with defensive coordinator Carl
Reese. He is willing to rifle through his whole pile until he finds a couple
who can really play. Cory Redding was better than usual against Stanford. But
that position still needs a lot of work. The blocked punt occurred because
one player, who blocked perfectly on 11 other punts Saturday night, failed to
block a player coming right up the middle, which guarantees doom. That player
has been chewed out every which way.

As far as the penalties, there were several questionable calls. But Brown,
who did a lot of yelling at officials during the Stanford game, couldn't say
anything about it after the game because he would be fined. Texas can still
have a good season, and perhaps having these problem areas pointed out so
early will help in that direction. We'll see if Texas takes this loss
constructively or destructively.



Q: Last year at times I saw blazing speed and ability from Cory Redding. I
know he was considered by many to be the best high school defensive player in
the country in 1998. I've waited all off-season to see him explode against
teams this year. I haven't seen it yet. Maybe this week against Stanford. My
question is, why was he moved from his high school position of linebacker
where he was dominant into the defensive end role where he seems undersized
and average? Is Texas that low on defensive line talent? It seems our
recruiting has been great. Please help me understand. Hook 'em Horns!
Ernie McAnally

BROWN:  Redding told me recently that linebacker is still his first love.
But he said coaches came to him last year and said he could get on the field
right away as a defensive end. Coaches also feel that his body (6-5, 260) is
perfect for the DE position. He's tall, athletic, fast and has long arms. In
time, coaches feel Redding will develop into an All-America player. But there
is no question that he has struggled against the run. He made some big plays
against Stanford, recording six tackles, three of them for losses and
blocking an extra point attempt. He is just a sophomore. Over this season and
the next two years, he should only get better.


Q: I was watching the regional telecast of the TCU game today and the
announcers  stated that TCU had anted up $90,000 for the Heisman campaign for
LaDainian Tomlinson. How much did UT spend on its campaign for Ricky
Williams' run for the Heisman?

BROWN:  Texas didn't spend that much money at all. They produced a few
postcards, a video and a CD-ROM screen saver to send out to the national
media detailing Ricky's accomplishments. But those costs totaled less than
$10,000, according to UT officials.



Q: Did any of the freshman who did not play in the Louisiana-Lafayette game
play in the Stanford game? I am watching to see which ones might be
redshirts.
Mike Smith, Houston

BROWN:  According to the participation chart provided at the Stanford-Texas
game, Austin Sendlein was the only freshman to play against the Cardinal who
did not play against Louisiana-Lafayette. In addition to Sendlein, here are
the other freshmen who have played so far: WRs Roy Williams, B.J. Johnson and
Sloan Thomas; TE Brock Edwards; DE Kalen Thornton; CB Nathan Vasher; FS
Phillip Geiggar; and DT Stevie Lee.



Q: Is it true that in Mack Brown's four or five head coaching stops, his
teams have yet to win a single conference championship? Since UT has lost
four out of its last five games, wouldn't a loss to Houston this week
officially end Mack Brown's honeymoon with the alumni, notwithstanding his
abundant PR program? With Brown about to land his third national Top 5
recruiting class, I believe fans are going to expect more gridiron victories
to go with those recruiting victories.
T. Hough

BROWN:  It's true that Brown has yet to win a conference championship in
stints at Appalachian State, Tulane, North Carolina and now Texas. At
Appalachian State, Tulane and UNC, he was taking over absolutely dead
programs. He took Tulane to a bowl, and he had Florida State to deal with in
the Atlantic Coast Conference while at UNC. But he took UNC to six bowl games
in his 10 years at UNC and won four of them.

A loss to Houston would certainly intensify the frustration of Texas
faithful. But I think anyone who would be looking to put Brown on the hot
seat or rip him if Texas lost to Houston would be overlooking the job he has
done beating Nebraska (twice), Oklahoma (twice) and Texas A(once) in his
first two seasons here. He has also turned Texas back into a destination
school for top recruits and brought the UT community back together. In
addition to all that, he has done more good for UT out of the limelight than
probably most Texas fans realize.

Brown is now in the same spotlight as Bobby Bowden, John Cooper, Lloyd Carr,
Steve Spurrier and Phil Fulmer. Any unexpected losses are unforgivable in the
eyes of fans. It may take some time for Brown and his team to adjust to that.
UNC fans were pretty ho-hum about everything the Tar Heels did in football,
even when they won big. Brown wanted to win at a school with huge
expectations. He'll have to adjust now that it appears Texas will be starting
out the next few seasons in the Top 10.



Q: Is Lee Jackson out for the Houston game?
Marty Bonner

BROWN:  Jackson is out for the Houston game with a hamstring pull suffered
against Stanford. He may also miss the Oklahoma State game. Mack Brown said
this is a bad week to be without Jackson because Houston can throw the ball
really well.



Q: Is Ricky Williams' jersey being retired at the Oklahoma State game Sept.
30?
Mark Wilson

BROWN:  Yes. Williams' No. 34 will be retired at that game. Williams has
said he will be there because the New Orleans Saints are off that weekend.
Host Communications has also just finished a video biography on Williams that
will be available soon.



Q: What did Mack Brown say about the expectations surrounding his team after
the loss to Stanford?
Virginia Blair

BROWN:  Again, here are Mack's words: "I said during the pre-season that we
were overrated. I didn't see any reason with the youth, the way we finished
last year and the inexperience across the board that we should have been a
Top 5 football team. One of the great things about Texas is that you receive
a tremendous amount of attention and publicity, but in some cases people want
to push you too fast to get to the top. I think that we were in that position
and expectations got out of hand. I knew that we would have a difficult game
at Stanford and that it would be a tough game to win. I also didn't think
that we deserved to be ranked fifth in the country. Our current rank within
the Top 15 is much more fitting for where we are today."
