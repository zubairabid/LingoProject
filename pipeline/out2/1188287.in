Thank you very much - can I get a copy of the Risk article?

The BIS numbers unfortunately do not distinguish which of the commodity
numbers are applicable to energy, and worse yet they include only numbers
from reporting banks.  In the energy area a large proportion of the
transactions are by non-bank institutions -this makes finding the numbers
much harder because companies like Enron are not required to publicly
disclose their positions.  Hopefully the Risk article has some numbers but if
you can find anything else specifically relating to the size of the energy
derivatives markets that would be helpful.
