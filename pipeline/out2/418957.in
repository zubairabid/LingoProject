Tanna,

Thanks for your help on the Goldman Sachs and Deutsche negotiations.  If
you could keep me posted on the timing of the Deutsche agreements being
put in place that would be really helpful.  I also have another quick
request and that relates to the ISDA Master Agreement with FUNB.  I have
spoken to Delene Travella at FUNB.  They are negotiating an ECTRIC
Schedule with you in Houston which they want to finalise before
commencing
EnronCredit.com's negotiation.  Can you give me an update on where this
negotiation stands and how long before it is likely to be finalised?

Many thanks,

Clare Godson
