Hi Everyone,

As you know, we've had a few problems this semester with the audio on the
videotapes that have been made.  In talking with the media center, several
suggestions were made that I would like to share with you:

(1)  The media center uses the "passing time" to set up the video equipment
in each classroom.  The passing time for classes that do not have another
class in the room previously is from 5:50 pm to 6:00 pm.  The passing time
for classes that do have another class in the room previously is from 5:55
to 6:05 pm.  It would be very helpful to the media center if students did
not enter the classroom until the end of the passing time.  One of the
problems has been that the technicians have been rushed because of the
incoming and outgoing flow of students, and they do not have time to ensure
that all the equipment is fully functioning.

(2)  The media center would also like to request that students wait until
the end of the passing time to enter the room because several of their
technicians have been injured (sprained ankles, etc.) when students step on
their feet and legs while they're taping cables to the floor.

(3)  Please be sure to avoid placing any papers, binders, etc. over the
microphones that are placed on the tables.

Hopefully, the above three steps will help improve the "audio portion of
this broadcast."

Thanks!

Diane
