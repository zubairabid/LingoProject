Steve:

Dwight Larson asked Steve Angle and me to prepare a list of mitigation
measures we believe would help get FERC and SEC approval so that the merger
could close by year end.  Attached is a list that Steve Angle and I put
together.  Dwight is preparing a summary of our comments (along with others')
for your review prior to the meeting with Walt Higgins, but I thought you may
want to see the list Steve and I put together.

A couple of caveats to the list:  First, for vertical market power, we
propose that PGE release its firm transmission capacity into California when
Sierra is using the Alturas line (i.e., at times when TANC and SMUD are
prevented from importing up to 300 MW into California).  However, the cost to
PGE to release this capacity is apparently great and could have a material
adverse effect on PGE.  Therefore, we may need to consider other mitigation
measures -- such as capping the price of power sold by PGE into California
during these times.  This mitigation is not as clean as a release of capacity
-- it requires FERC to monitor PGE's sales and FERC could have some concern
that PGE could game the rules.  Nevertheless, it may be the only viable form
of mitigation we have.  We did not propose this alternative option in our
list of mitigation measures.

Second, we need assurance from PGE that the buyback contracts they are
negotiating in the sale of their generators will not give Sierra market power
(a concern raised by FERC in the July 26 order).

Call me if you have any questions.  Good luck with the meeting tomorrow.
