Richard,

Following our coversation of yesterday, I set out for you below the following:

1.  An explanation (in draft) of the Dutch power market and the events
leading up to the current market "squeeze" by certain players, which we have
produced and discussed for our external lawyers.

2.  A schematic of arguments which we produced for external lawyers before
Christmas just relating to the mis-application of capacity by TenneT.

3.  A copy of our e-mail to Clifford Chance of last Wednesday summarising the
issues in order of priority for their advice.

Please note that, purely on the swap element of this jigsaw, we are
attempting to arrange a conference with a Queen's Counsel for next Monday
afternoon.  Hence, it may be better for our meeting (with Jeff patched-in) to
take place next Tuesday - clearly the advice on all the elements involved (as
set out in 3) in toto will not be complete until we have had the conference
with the QC.

I am due to receive tomorrow, however, from Clifford Chance their legal
strategy report on all the other issues raised in my e-mail (item 3) and
shall forward you a copy on receipt.

Kind regards

Mark
