Rick -

Attached is a Resources Spreadsheet for our meeting tomorrow afternoon.  The
spreadsheet is broken out by Cost Center and lists employee name, project the
employee is working on, and the business unit affected (if known).  There is
also a column for prob. of success that I thought would be filled out at the
meeting.  The information on this spreadsheet is taken from the monthly
reports (that I have worked on or have received) and the old IRTF report
submitted.  I also spoke to Ricardo who gave me his projects.  I've worked
with Jim Steffes, Sue Nord, and Lisa Yoho on the preparation of their monthly
reports.  I know that Jim's report went out yesterday but I haven't seen the
final version.  You should receive the final report for Sue and Lisa this
week.  Please advise if the information on the attached spreadsheet meets our
needs for tomorrow.  I can make changes in the morning.  I've got to work on
Lisa's report in the morning and finalize the presentation for Friday.  I
think Lisa left you a voice mail about the training program.  The slides are
done for the presentation and I need to write what I'm going to say.  I think
that's it for now.  Sorry if this rambles.
