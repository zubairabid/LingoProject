Tim and Murray,

Yesterday the real-time desk experienced dropped Terminal Server (TS)
sessions which impacted their productivity. Diana and Chip contacted the
network team in Houston to assist with troubleshooting the problem. Keith
Dziadek monitored the DS3 VPN connection between Portland and Houston and has
determined that it is the dynamic fail-over within the Enron Intelligent
Network (EIN) which is causing the dropped TS sessions. This dynamic
fail-over is a good thing. Our issue is that the sensitivity of the TS
sessions is so high that the time of the dynamic fail-over on the EIN causes
them to drop while all other applications (i.e. Enpower running locally in
Portland) are not affected.

Keith is meeting with his team in Houston as well as staff from EBS today to
form an action plan. Once the action plan has been established, Keith or I
will communicate what and when it will be done to you via email.

You can reach me on my cel if you have any questions.

Regards,

Dan Dietrich
