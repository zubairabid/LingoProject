Rushing Game Matchups  Here's how I see  the matchups this week. Please
note, see the cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week15sheet.htm
for exactly where I rank players and to  determine who to start. Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily  mean I'd start the player with the best matchup. The matchup
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to deciding
between players.

Locks: These games heavily  favor the Offense

Stephen Davis  (Was) vs Cowboy Defense  New Coach Terry  Robiskie,s been
saying he,ll run Davis into the ground. Against a run defense as soft as
the  Cowboy,s, no telling how many yards he,ll gain. The arm seems ok and I
look for a huge  game here. RBs roll up 200 yards on  Dallas like it,s an
average day(

Darnell Autry /  Chris Warren (Phi) vs Brown Defense It remains to be seen
what  effect (if any) newly signed Chris Warren will have this week. It
wouldn,t surprise me a bit if Andy  Reid isn,t able to come up with at least
a small package of plays that feature  Warren. He,s a thousand times  better
than Darnell Autry. If he  can,t go this week, I,d look for him to be a
factor next week for sure. The Browns defense ranks # 30 in  rushing yards
allowed per game over the last four weeks so the matchup is  enticing.

Fred Taylor (Jac)  vs Cardinal Defense Every once in a while, those &too
good to be true8 matchups don,t pan out.  This is certainly one of those
&too good to be true8 situations but I,d  be shocked if Taylor doesn,t just
roll over the Cards. They can,t stop the run even when they  know what,s
coming at them. Arizona  ranks # 29 in rushing yards allowed per game over
the last month. That number won,t go down any after this  week.

Mike Anderson  (Den) vs Seahawk Defense Starting any player facing the
Seahawks is not a bad rule of thumb.  They,ve been pretty bad and this week
they don,t stand a chance against  the dominating OL of Denver.  Anderson
practiced fully Thursday so he looks good to go. Keep an eye on the weather
as they,re  expecting snow in Denver but I,m not too worried about how it,ll
effect  Anderson.

Ron Dayne (NYG) vs  Steeler Defense This was the type of game they  drafted
Dayne for. A ground war vs  Pittsburgh in December. It,s not  likely the
Steelers will jump to a big lead and force the Giants to catchup mode  which
means pretty much no Dayne.  This is shaping up to be a classic battle with
Bettis on one side and  Warren on the other.





Prime Matchups: These games favor the  Offense

Sammy Morris  / Shawn Bryson (Buf) vs Colts Defense  Keep an eye on who can
go for the Bills this week but whoever starts will  likely have some good
rushing numbers on the carpet in Indiana. There were some semi encouraging
signs  that Morris might be back. The Colts rank just # 25 over the last 4
weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game. They,re  soft on the run and
someone could make a big splash on Monday  Night.

Charlie  Garner (SF) vs Saints Defense Just as they are with their pass
defense, the Saints rush defense is overrated. Over the last four weeks,
they rank # 23  in rushing yards allowed  per game. And  Garner is liable to
explode at any time.  He,s too good in both the rushing and passing game to
consider sitting  down unless you,re just loaded.

Warrick Dunn  (TB) vs Miami Defense It was surprising to me to see the
Dolphins slide this far on rush defense.  Over the last four weeks, they
rank # 23 in rushing yards allowed per  game. Doesn,t seem  right but that,s
what the numbers say.  Either way, Dunn,s a must start given what he,s done
lately.

Robert Smith  (Min) vs Ram Defense Like the passing defense, the Rams  rush
defense has improved over the year.  It doesn,t matter though.  You,ve got
to start Robert Smith.  End of story. He may be the  best RB in the league
if truth be told.

Emmitt Smith  (Dal) vs Redskin Defense I think I may be the only one who
sees it this way, but I believe the Chris Warren booting was a real
statement  for Smith. Sure, he still may not  get the 3rd down carries as
they get a look at Michael Wiley but  Emmitt is pretty much working without a
net here. He proved his mettle once again last  week hammering against a
tough Tampa team.  The Cowboys also showed how little faith they have in
their passing game  as they continued to feed Smith the ball even when
trailing badly. Washington  ranks # 21 over the last four weeks in rushing
yards allowed per  game so they,re very beatable.

Tony  Richardson (KC) vs Panther Defense  Another week, another RB shakeup
in KC as this time it,s Kimble Anders  who,s out of the mix. I honestly
have a hard time trusting coach Gunther Cunningham with any of them but it
looks  like Richardson will get the bulk of the work right now. The Panthers
can be run on. Keep an eye on the weather in this one  as the passing game
could be limited.



James Allen  (Chi) vs Patriot Defense What a mess Chicago finds itself
in. The messiah QB is now healthy  but still on the bench while the &guru8
offensive coordinator has left (been run  out of?) town for Utah and both
starting WRs are gone for the year with  injuries. James Allen may be the
bright spot as he,s run hard and effectively. The New England defense can
be  vulnerable to the run and this may be another week where they rely on
Allen to  carry a heavy load.



Even Matchups: These games  feature no real advantage either way

Edgerrin James (Ind) vs Bills  Defense  Edgerrin may be  having one of the
best &poor8 seasons in NFL history. He,s posting great numbers overall but
you,ll have a hard time finding a James owner who,s real happy with him. If
he,s your guy, you have very little  choice but to start him in the Monday
Night game. The Colts are tougher at home and  hopefully they won,t find
themselves playing catchup again. Although with his receiving ability,  he,s
still active in that situation but it,s not the ideal scenario for any RB
when his team is playing from behind.  The Bills rank # 18 over the last
four weeks in rushing yards allowed per  game so it,s a pretty average
rushing  defense.

Tyrone Wheatley (Oak) vs Jets  Defense I,ll keep an eye on this one for
you but I,m hearing while the ankles may be better, a broken finger may be
giving him trouble. Some are  speculating this is the cause of his 2 fumbles
last week. The Jets play pretty solid rush defense  so it,s truly a matchup
that could go either way. I,ll try to see what I can find out on  this one.

Michael Pittman (Ari) vs Jaguar  Defense The Pittman injury watch
continues  as he,s still battling turf toe. He  sat out of practice Thursday
and may not know his status until Friday or  Saturday. If he can,t go, it
looks  like Clarence Williams could get the start. If you,re scrambling for
RBs, he,s  likely available in your league.  Even assuming Pittman can go,
it,s not a great matchup as the Jags have  picked up the level of their play
lately.

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Buccaneer Defense  Don,t let the Buc defense scare
you. They,re a very good unit but as Emmitt  Smith proved last week, a
determined rusher can fare ok there. Lamar Smith surely falls under that
&determined8 class. If he,s your  guy, I,d still go with him. Tampa  ranks
# 16 over the last four week in rushing yards allowed per game. They,re
allowing an average of 108 yards  per game over that time so it,s not like
they,re Baltimore (48 yards per game  over their last 3)



Curtis Martin (NYJ) vs Raider Defense  Like Tampa, the Raiders rush defense
has a bark that,s a little worse  than their bite. They,re solid but  not a
defense that sends RBs running for cover. They rank # 17 in rushing yards
allowed  per game over the last four weeks.  Martin looked great last week
and looks to be guy they,re counting on to  carry the offense.



Eddie George (Ten) vs Bengal  Defense Most people have this image in  their
heads of the Bengal defense laying down against the run. Not so. Over the
last four weeks, only 8 teams  are tougher in allowing rushing yards per
game. Maybe that,s because teams choose to  pass the ball where Cincinnati
is weak but the bottom line is teams don,t run a  tremendous amount on them.
However,  if QB Steve McNair is limited with a bad ankle and knee, you,ll
see a team that runs the ball as  their 1st, 2nd and 3rd option. (pretty
much their style with a healthy  McNair too() George is a must  start even
though it,s no slam dunk on the matchup.



James Stewart (Det) vs Packer Defense  Depending on the weather and Charlie
Batch,s ribs, Stewart could be asked  to carry the load this week. Green
Bay is hurting on Defense with DT Steve Warren the latest injured Packer on
defense. On the flip side, they,re  playing pretty stingy rush defense
averaging 104 rushing yards allowed per game  over their last 4 which ranks
them # 14.





Downside Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Brad Hoover (Car)  vs Chief Defense  With Tshimanga  Biakabutuka reverting
back to his normal &can,t stay healthy8 form he,s  displayed for most of his
career, Hoover gets another shot this week. The Chiefs are tough at home and
the  weather could be a factor (possibly in his favor) but Hoover will take
his power  rushing style into Arrowhead and see how he fares. Kansas City
ranks # 8 over the last four  weeks in rushing yards allowed per game so they,
re pretty  solid.

Travis Prentice /  Jamel White (Cle) vs Eagle Defense Neither of these guys
is doing a  great job and they,ll both likely struggle against an Eagle team
that,s serious  about defense. If it were me, I,d  look elsewhere if these
were my guys.

Marshall Faulk  (Stl) vs Viking Defense While they,re under appreciated,
the Viking rush defense is pretty good.  Over the last four weeks, they rank
# 11 in rushing yards allowed per  game. They,ll have all they want  with
Marshall Faulk but the defense is one of the tougher one,s Faulk will  face.
He,s still a no brainer to  start regardless of the opponent.  He,s
reportedly feeling ok with the knees although he admits to being  worried
about them both. Coach Mike  Martz has talked about using him on special
teams to help turn that unit  around.

J.R. Redmond /  Patrick Pass / Kevin Faulk (NE) vs Bears Defense  With
Redmond still ailing, the Patriot RB situation is a mess. And Bill Belichick
certainly isn,t  shedding much light on anything.  Unless Redmond shows he
can be 100%, I,d probably shy away from all 3 of  them as it,s too much of a
shot in the dark trying to predict Belichick. The Bears are playing pretty
tough rush  defense with rookie sensation Brian  Urlacher.

Ahman Green (GB)  vs Lion Defense One bright spot for the Packers  this
year has been the outstanding play of Ahman Green. Coach Mike Holmgren in
Seattle could  have likely saved a # 1 pick on Alexander if Green was still
in Seattle. Green,s always had the physical skills  but he lagged behind in
other areas.  Now, he seems to have brought the mental part of the game up
significantly and the results are showing on the field. It,s a tough matchup
as the Lions rank #  7 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per
game but I think he,s up  for it.



Defensive Slam Dunks: These games heavily favor the  Defense

Ricky  Watters (Sea) vs Bronco Defense Denver evidently didn,t take  kindly
to Corey Dillon hanging a Hall of Fame type day on them several weeks ago  as
they,ve been tough against the run since then. Over the last four weeks,
they rank # 2  in rushing yards allowed  per game allowing just 57 yards per
game. Watters is a solid player and not unlike  an Emmitt Smith, he,s a guy
that,s made a living performing against the tough  teams in tough games. So
it,s not  like I,m terrified of this matchup.  Just be aware, it,s a tough
one.  One thing you might want to consider is that coach Mike Holmgren has
said  at some point, he wants to see more of rookie Shaun Alexander,
especially in the  passing game. How much he,d like to  see isn,t known
right now.

Terrell  Fletcher (SD) vs Baltimore Defense  Let,s not go there.
Baltimore is allowing an average of 48 yards rushing per game over their
last 3 games. I don,t see Fletcher  as the guy who breaks that trend.

Jerald Moore  / Chad Morton / Terry Allen (NO) vs  49er Defense Early
this week, both Moore  and Morton were injured and feared to possibly miss
Sunday,s game. They appear to be healing ahead of  schedule and now it looks
like both may play. Allen spent time running with the first  unit in
practice so it,s really murky right now. I,d tend to shy away from all these
guys  as I think they,ll let QB Aaron Brooks throw the ball like he did last
week. Besides, the 49ers are  deceptively stingy against the rush ranking #
3 over the last four weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game.

Corey Dillon  (Cin) vs Titan Defense Yes, this is a tough matchup. But so
was Denver and the jersey Dillon  wore in that particular tough matchup is
now hanging in Canton, Ohio. I learned (and I hope you did too) to go  with
the young man pretty much regardless of the opponent. Tennessee is very good
in defending the  rush but I see very little way you could bench Dillon
unless you,re just  loaded.

Jamal Lewis  (Bal) vs Charger Defense Lewis is clearly the class of the
rookie crop offensively. I hear  some say they think his early season elbow
injury was actually a blessing as it  let him stay fresh. I don,t know
about that but I do know he,s running very hard and effectively. He does
draw a tough matchup this week  against a Charger defense that,s only
allowing 81 rushing yards per game over  the last 4 games which earns them a
ranking of # 5. Still though, you pretty much have to  ride Lewis if he,s
your guy.

Jerome  Bettis (Pit) vs Giant Defense This could be a classic battle
between two big backs in Ron Dayne and Jerome Bettis. Bettis lives for these
kind of games and  he,ll get to lay it on the line Sunday.  He,s a likely
starter in your league but the Giants are tough against the  rush. Over the
last four weeks,  they rank # 6 in rushing  yards allowed per game.  I,d
still feel good about starting Bettis if he were on my roster but you  need
to be aware it,ll likely be tough going.
