I completely agree with you.

Nevertheless, I am sorry if I did not make myself clear when we talked about
this last Tuesday: I am not advocating penalizing business units because of
their 1week ROVARs or Sharpes.  I would certainly not set traders' bonuses
based on these numbers (nor do I think anyone at Enron would consider doing
that).

Enron focuses on long term profit and risk.  However, the long term is made
up of many short terms, and catastrophes can occur if a company's management
does not pay close attention to the latter.  Indeed, Enron management is very
interested in short term profitability (they want to be notified of very
large 1 and 5 day losses) and short term risk (we report daily VaR limit
violations).  In this spirit, I am simply offering 1 and 4 week ROVARs and
Sharpes as something interesting and useful that we can now produce from the
DPR database, and I will let upper management use or ignore them as they see
fit.

Regards,



Eugenio
