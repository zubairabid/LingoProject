Hi John,

I'm attaching the current draft of the contract under which we will be able
to buy the Fuel Cell equipment for use on projects in Connecticut.  The
contract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someone
give it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?

One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest in the
equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume that an
equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.  Can
you have this verified?  I only want the simplest of explanations.

Thanks,

Kay
