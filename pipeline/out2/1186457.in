I haven't seen any of the press reports (even though I am in London and I
hear that's where they were) but I thought this was a well drafted response.
The only additional rumours I have heard indicate that the police may have
been rough in their handling of demonstrators outside the fence at the plant
construction site.  I remember hearing that there were times that the
construction workers feared for their lives because of the vehemence of the
protesters.  I guess that didn't make it into the Human Rights Watch (ever
heard of them?) report.
