Good points, Chris, and well taken.
The PUC Commisisoners took some heat for their heavy-handed approach at
hearings held by Congress on Monday and FERC on Tuesday.  I think those
hearings may have loosened things the Commission up at least somewhat, though
finding a balance between Commission willingness to grant pre-approval and
utility willingness to wear some risk in exchange won't be a cakewalk.
We need to remind the Commission that they gave 100 % pre-approved
reasonableness for purchases from the PX, and that pre-approval for other
purchases is necessary.  That said, I concur that it ain't a gimmee.
