The Moorings people asked me to call back tomorrow when they'll have a better
idea about the storm situation - they canceled all of their charter starts
for today & tomorrow (no surprise) and she expected Thursday's to cancel
also.  They still have everything for the weekend scheduled to go out but
they weren't supposed to confirm any hotel rooms between now and Saturday.
They were able to confirm a room for you for Sunday the 28th (the day we have
to bring the boat back).  I'll let you know what happens when I get through
to them tomorrow.
