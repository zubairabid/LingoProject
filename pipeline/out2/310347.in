We are moving forward to transfer the positions from the emissions books (SO2
and NOx) to the coal group at close of business 5/23/00.  The SO2 marks for
both the underlying and volatility positions currently in the 2007 through
2010 timeframe create a value differential of $2.6 million between our
evaluation and their marks.  For the sake of not continuing the unproductive
task of negotiating this value, we will move forward to transfer despite our
differences.

I strongly recommend continuing to use and pay for all personnel in risk,
documentation and settlement that currently perform these duties for
emissions.
I would like to utilize these resources until further notice.  I am not
comfortable committing to any transfer of risk, documentation and settlement
duties until we have the time to evaluate this further.  I would appreciate
if you could help on this matter to ensure a smooth transition.
