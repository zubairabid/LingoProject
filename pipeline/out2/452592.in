Having worked on the Enron Advisory council process, I have one observation:
consider having some or all of these individuals as "guest speakers" rather
than formal memebers.  You can still have them review information, do their
homework, and tailor their remarks to Enron specifics.
Also, you should definitely include Paul Portney at Resources for the
Future.  He sits on the Enron Advisory Council and knows the company well.
