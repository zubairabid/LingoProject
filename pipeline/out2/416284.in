Per conv. w/Anthony, we should expect 13 people.  We do not need to
teleconference anyone in.  Anthony wanted the London Global Contracts people
on the line, but I discussed it with Mark, and their forms and legal issues
are so different from ours that I told Anthony that they need to contact
London Legal if they would like a presentation.
