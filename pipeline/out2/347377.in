Follow - up to our first meeting -

We had very good participation.  In the absence of some technical
difficulties, we would have had 100% participation.

As our discussion showed, people bring different issues and needs to the
group.  It seems that this group will function best if we serve as a source
of information and resources to each other.  Our collective knowledge is
capable of helping many different individual problems; we just need to figure
how to get the right information to the people who need it.  Our first task
should be to sort through this wide ranging topic and start to focus on some
specific deliverables.

Attached is an updated roster of the team, and a listing of the subgroups and
some ideas of what the subgroup should consider.  These ideas are not meant
to restrict but give some additional clarity.  Please note the subgroup
membership and the designated team leads, and begin your discussions.

Our next meeting will be Friday, February 4, 9:30 am - 11 am Central Standard
Time.  More details on phone/video conferencing and a full agenda will be
given later.  At the meeting, each subgroup should share with the larger
group their thoughts on the directions to be taken by the subgroup.  At that
time, we can all offer additional comments.



Thank you!
