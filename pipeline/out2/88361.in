Hello fellow team members.

So I have recruited all of you to help out in the Enron Elves program. The
program is designed to help raise funds to buy gifts for a family and
currently, we (West Desk) has sponsored three families. Our family has two
kids with a single parent (mother). There is an 11-year old daughter and
8-year old son.

I hope that everyone will do their best to help out. We basically need to
raise money by asking people we know and even companies that some of you
might have ties with and then we go shopping and finally wrap the presents
and deliver them to the family.

The money should be in by Friday December 15th and the gift wrapping is
scheduled for Tuesday December 19th. We will go shopping for the gifts in
between then.

We need to keep track of the amount of the donation, name and address of the
person that donated so that they are able to use the donation as a tax
deduction.  If you have any other questions or ideas about gifts or raising
money, feel free to stop by my desk or email me.

Happy Thanksgiving and let's go raise some money.
