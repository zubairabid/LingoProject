Don't ever be sorry for venting to me.  I feel privileged that you trust me
that much as a friend and god knows I've cried to you a hundred times about
stuff.  You are so right about the fact that you had a way better
relationship with your Dad then most guys do.  I mean, look at my brother
and my Dad - Jesse doesn't even call him Dad.  Why in the world would your
Mom and Angela freak out on you for having human feelings?  I don't get it.
And besides all that, you were the one who used to help me and basically
write all that stuff for me so "YOU CAN DO IT!!"
Tootie is doing good.  She went in on Monday to find out if the tumor was
operable and found out that it is buried so deep in her brain that if they
even attempted to operate on it, it would probably paralyze her whole left
side.  So she goes in on Tuesday to Emanuel hospital for this high voltage
radiation treatment that's supposed to zap the shit out of the tumor.  Then
they'll check it in four months to see if it's shrunk.  If not, I guess they
will continue with the regular radiation treatments.  I talked to her on
Tuesday and she seems in really good spirits.  I'm looking forward to seeing
her on Thanksgiving.  What are you doing for Thanksgiving?  Are you going
home?
What are you doing for the Civil War game??  If you're not going to
Corvallis, do you want to watch it together somewhere?? I hope you don't
have to work this weekend.  We should have dinner too - Beaches!!!  I've
been craving their stuffed mushrooms and I haven't been there since the last
time you and I went.  Write me back....
