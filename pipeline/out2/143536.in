Rude Dog,

Maverick,  It's no good up here.  I'm holding on too tight.  I've lost the
edge.

Yes, it is close.  I am pretty pumped.  I am also extremely nervous about
Barnette and their passing game.  Looks like Walker and Hill will be the
starting corners.  Yikes!  I think our defense will be able to put some
pressure on Barnette with the type of speed we have at linebacker now.  If we
don't get any pressure on Barnette, I think we will likely lose this game.
But I am hopeful that big Shaun Rogers will wreak havoc in the middle.

The offense is still a big questions.  The level of talent on the OL gives me
comfort.  Davis, Kirk-Hughes (so big they gave him two names), Roesler, etc.
are all big time.  The 1st series should be really interesting.  I think we
come out passing lights out to loosen up the run defense.  Then start sending
Ike off Roesler and Davis.  Occasionally send Flowers down the field on the
fly and have Applewhite throw it as far as he can.  It is going to be a good
one.

Which game is the first one you'll be able to go to?  How are the Australian
women?  Bring pictures and stories.  Preferably with much embellishment.
