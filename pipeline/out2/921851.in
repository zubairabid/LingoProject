Sally,
The May 18th date is locked in stone.  We have already reserved seats on a
Continental flight @ Noon Thursday, May 18.  It's unfortunate that Mark was
not kept up to date, but we have only moved back the date 1 time due to the
May Day riots.  Tom and I have been in constant contact and we have confirmed
the move-out date.  The book-split project will be implemented tomorrow and I
will spend the next few days ensuring that the traders understand how to book
their deals and that Risk is able to generate and explain the DPR on a timely
basis.  Also, while I am here I plan to meet with the Weather Derivatives
team to assess their needs and gain an understanding of their markets.
This project will not drag on day-by-day as mentioned below.  There is much
more that can be done, but that is out of the scope of this project; besides
I am ready to come home.
