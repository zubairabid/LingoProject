Allegheny joins PJM, others to follow
In the  1840s, Horace Greeley urged a generation to "go West." One hundred
sixty years  later, thanks to the cooperation of Allegheny Energy, PJM is
expanding westward  and increasing the likelihood that a wholesale
electricity market that is  liquid, transparent, and genuinely competitive
will stake a claim in western  Pennsylvania and beyond.

On October 5th, Allegheny Energy and PJM agreed to develop &PJM West,8 a
separate entity that should spur reform and substantial expansion of the
original PJM. PJM West will not utilize the discredited Installed Capacity
(ICAP) rules now employed by PJM. On ICAP, the biggest consumer rip-off in
the  wholesale electric marketplace, PJM becomes a house divided, and ICAP,s
days are  numbered. For this reason alone, PJM West is a welcome sight on
the  horizon.

Initially PJM West will contain Allegheny Energy,s service territory, which
includes parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, and Ohio. But soon
more  control areas will follow Allegheny Energy,s trail and &go West.8

Serving the Pittsburgh area, Duquesne Light Company is also actively
considering joining PJM West. In its October 16th filing with the Federal
Energy  Regulatory Commission (FERC), Duquesne states: &If Allegheny,s
memorandum of  understanding with PJM results in Allegheny,s affiliation with
PJM, Duquesne  also will be contiguous with PJM. In anticipation of that
event, Duquesne has  commenced discussions with PJM to discuss the process by
which PJM might admit  Duquesne to PJM-West.8

Although Duquesne states that it is also considering membership in the
Alliance RTO, we would bet the ranch that PJM West will become a reality and
that Duquesne will join it. Moreover, not far behind Allegheny Energy and
Duquesne Light may well be First Energy and some other utilities that are
now  part of the Alliance RTO proposal.

Congratulations to Allegheny Energy for giving the people of its service
territory access to the existing 58,000 megawatt PJM wholesale market * a
market  that is much more transparent, liquid, and competitive than its
present control  area. In turn, the successful integration of Allegheny
Energy and Duquesne Light  into the PJM market would effectively increase it
by about 11,000  megawatts.

PJM West: the proposal
PJM and Allegheny  Energy,s Memorandum of Understanding establishes a vision
for PJM West.  Allegheny Energy and PJM will form an independent transmission
company that will  regain from PJM, subject to FERC acceptance, those
operational and management  functions that are needed for the successful
operation of an independent  transmission business.

PJM West will set up its own office and the PJM West Transmission Owners
would transfer monitoring and functional control of their transmission
systems  to PJM. It will also expand the PJM system management concepts
beyond a single  control area with the potential for a significantly larger
energy market that  could include Ohio's First Energy Corp.

Allegheny will adopt PJM,s market operations policies. It will cede
functional control of its transmission assets to PJM, eliminate &pancaked8
transmission rates, utilize locational marginal pricing, and work with the
FERC  and other regional RTOs to develop rate reciprocity agreements and a
transitional rate structure that will be revenue neutral. PJM will be the
OASIS  operator for PJM West.

Allegheny Energy will operate under the existing ECAR rules regarding
operating reserve requirements, reserve sharing, and other operating
standards,  and will work with PJM to develop a regime to ensure that PJM
West receives full  credit for its capacity anywhere within the PJM market.
ICAP will not be  expanding into PJM West.

PJM will retain certain functions related to the operation of the energy
market, including the PJM market, congestion management protocol, and market
monitoring responsibilities. Allegheny Energy will freely participate in the
PJM  energy market, including the necessary wholesale price cap. By providing
access  to PJM,s energy market, PJM West may also give Allegheny Energy a
means of  meeting the scheduling needs of several proposed wind farms in its
control areas  and avoiding an unfortunate regulatory battle (see
&Electricity,s Oktoberfest:  Trouble blowing in the wind,8 PennFuture,s E3,
Vol. 2, No. 20, Oct. 4, 2000).

In what is hopefully just a politically necessary fig leaf, the Memorandum
of Understanding states that Allegheny Energy will remain a distinct control
area from PJM. The purpose of this language is not clear and appears
inconsistent with the whole purpose of PJM. This point needs clarification
and  bears watching.

The timeline set out in the agreement includes negotiation for a definitive
contract to be completed by February 1, 2001, execution prior to March 1,
2001,  and implementation by December 15, 2001.

PJM West unravels Alliance
The rise of PJM West  spells the demise of the market-balkanizing Alliance
RTO proposal. With its  proven record of competency and governance
independence, PJM offers a much  better vehicle for bringing RTO services to
the service territories that would  be served with the untested, unknown
Alliance start up. To us, the only  certainty about the Alliance proposal is
that it will create one otherwise  avoidable transmission rate tollbooth and
constrain the size of the wholesale  market.

With the alternative of PJM West, FERC and state utility commissions should
now use their authority to shoot down the Alliance RTO proposal. Placing RTO
conditions that protect the public interest on the proposed merger of First
Energy and GPU would be a good start down that road. First Energy should be
given no choice but to leave the Alliance and join PJM, at least if they want
to  merge with GPU. First Energy itself has reportedly signaled to its
Alliance  partners that the merger with GPU comes before the Alliance.

First Energy,s departure from the Alliance RTO, the principal strategic
purpose of which appears to be keeping its member utilities out of PJM and
the  Midwest ISO and to fracture the wholesale market between Philadelphia
and  Chicago, would help unravel that counterproductive proposal and have
several  benefits. All of Orion,s generation that was purchased from Duquesne
and still  serves Duquesne,s customers would be within one RTO. Conversely,
if First Energy  were to remain in the Alliance, some of Orion,s generation
would be located in  the Alliance and some in PJM West (assuming Duquesne
joins PJM West). Requiring  First Energy to join PJM West would not only deal
with that seams issue, but  would also further expand the size and liquidity
of the wholesale market in the  eastern United States.

First Energy's ISO games
While the agreement  between Allegheny and PJM paves the way for Duquesne to
join PJM, what about  PennPower, the subsidiary of First Energy that serves
some suburbs of Pittsburgh  and up to the New Castle area of the
Commonwealth? Is there any hope for  PennPower customers, or worse, might
First Energy try to balkanize PJM by taking  GPU out of PJM?

Moving GPU out of PJM would be the electric utility equivalent of  suggesting
that one of the 50 states should secede from the Union and join  Mexico. Yet
First Energy may well have planned to remove GPU from PJM and  collapse it
into the Alliance or simply a larger First Energy. Such a bold move  would
undoubtedly be vigorously opposed by the Pennsylvania and New Jersey  Public
Utility Commissions.

The state commissions have great leverage while the merger is pending, but
once the merger is approved, the state commissions' power to protect the
public  interest diminishes. Moreover, as a result of the Centerior and First
Energy  merger, First Energy has a track record with RTOs and mergers that
does not  inspire confidence. It brings to mind the saying, &Fool me once,
shame on you;  fool me twice, shame on me.8

Consequently, the only way to make sure that First Energy will not remove
GPU from PJM is for the commissions of Pennsylvania and New Jersey to craft
a  set of conditions on the merger that make any such decision impossibly
painful.  Those conditions must also be effectively &securitized8 by the
equivalent of a  liquidated damages clause that would compensate Pennsylvania
and New Jersey were  First Energy subsequently to renege on its agreement not
to withdraw GPU from  PJM.

The public interest must be guaranteed. With the creation of PJM West by
Allegheny Energy and PJM, it can and should.
