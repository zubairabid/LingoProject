Attached is a revised Lease of Platform Space Agreement (LOPSA) for the MEGS
property associated with the Mariner Pluto subsea development. This version
has Mariner  as operator on behalf of MEGS, L.L.C. as Lessee. The responsible
party will be Mariner for performance and notification. The obligations
between Mariner and MEGS are covered in their separate agreement for O&M.
Please review and let me know if you have suggested changes. I will not be
able to access my e-mail between June 21 and June 29. Hopefully on June 29 we
will be in our new offices in Houston and ready to go.
Thanks,
BGP
