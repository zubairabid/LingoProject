Dan Reck is hoping to enter into discussions with Canadian National, who are
insisting upon the inclusion of a non-raid provision in the confidentiality
agreement, the offending clause is attached.

In speaking with Dan, his view is that it is more likely that Canadian
National would want to employ some of our people than us wanting to employ
any but their most senior people.

The period proposed is for one year after the date we have terminated our
discussions. I have asked that Canadian National consider a 6 month period
and they have not yet responded.

In looking at the legal policy on this, I see that the head business person
and you, as the General Counsel, will need to be comfortable with this
provision.
Once you have had the chance to review it I would be grateful if you could
advise as to what we are able to accept and who you believe is the "head
business person" who will also need to sign off on this.

Many thanks.
