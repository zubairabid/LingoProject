Hi Mark -

Could you provide a quick update on the status regarding the Subject of
whether the GTC's should continue to be attached to the Houston EOL
confirmations?  If you would prefer, I can also arrange to discuss this in
your office.  Please advise.

Thanks  -

Subject:  "The Legal Group in London (Justin Boyd) has advised that office
that it would be OK to stop sending GTC's with confirms.  The London
documentation teams in London have been advised to include the following
language on their EnronOnline transactions that are governed under GTC's (not
governed by Master Agreements):

"This Transaction is governed by the EnronOnline General Terms and Conditions
(GTC) that you have accepted via EnronOnline. For a copy of this GTC, please
click on the Product Description on the EnronOnline website and choose "View
GTC".

Please advise if this policy may be applied to the EnronOnline transactions
for the Houston office. "
