kim,
I called and left you a message before I read your e-mail.
I've talked to Lee and Carey.  Carey will reserve for Bonnie.

You will call Bootsey and Judy.  Judy will get in touch with Renee.
I will give Oni a call right now, but in case I am able to only leave a
message, will you call her again this afternoon.

Cyn and Lisa are done.

I plan to call Continental this evening around 6pm and check on the status
of everyone's paying.  So give me a call later tonight when it's convenient
for you.

The Continental agent that I talked to said that she and another agent
thought this was a really good fare.  They had discussed adding their names
to our group and going with us.  I said they were certainly welcome, but I'm
sure she was only kidding.

Damn we're good!!!!
