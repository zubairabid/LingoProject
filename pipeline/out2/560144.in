Shona -
RAC and Risk Ops are in this together and of course we'll continue to help in
understanding the violations.  I recognize and sympathize with the strain
your group is under with all the systems problems, the UK DPR  issues, the
increased limit change and policy compliance activity, etc..  My suggestions
were: 1) meant to streamline the process for you by making your data
gathering process easier, 2) I was offering to "be the bad guy" and point out
to the traders what we want them to do, and 3)meant to strengthen the
effectiveness of our risk management framework in this environmeant of
increasing exposure and volatile markets by reinforcing to the traders their
accountability for their positions and compliance with the policy limits.
I think the confusion here is  violation explanations being "validated" by
the traders as you indicated below, vs. "provided" by the traders as we
envision.  I confirmed with Ted, the traders are accountable for providing
the explanation.  I'm not sure how the suggestions below would be a set back
to your efforts of getting memos out earlier.  We're suggesting the traders
should provide you with explanations first thing in the morning, so that you
do not have to go through all the effort as you do now, of trying to track
people down in the afternoon and get explanations.  It should be the traders
responsibility to get them to you, and they should be reviewing their
positions every morning before they even begin trading., and should be able
to easily explain why they're in violation or why they had a big loss.
Whether the traders call your group directly and leave a voice mail, or they
talk to their Ops business unit controller who relays the explanation to you
- whatever you think makes sense and works for you.   I'm not trying to
manage the process, just to help design one that makes it easier for you and
is still effective from a risk management stand point.
At this point in this long series of e-mails, why don't we just talk face to
face.  I can tell from your response you feel we're somehow not being team
players, but that is not my intent at all.  I've tried to go out of my way
the past few weeks to tell you and your group how much Market Risk values and
appreciates your efforts.  And really, I thought I was helping by using the
policy's influence to help develop a better process that would decrease the
time and effort your group has to spend on the policy compliance reporting.
Perhaps a meeting with you and I and Sally would be appropriate.  We can talk
about this and any other questions or concerns you might have with RAC's
expectations.  I agree, we do have significant mid-office needs, and you have
been absorbing more tasks in the past couple of months since I joined RAC;
and my view is our needs seem to only be increasing as additional risk
reporting is required every day by Skilling.  We can continue to work on
streamlining processes, but maybe we need to think about staffing in our
respective groups and corresponding responsibilities.  I'm willing to do
whatever is needed, and I don't think Ted is hung up on who does what
either.  It's just that right now we're staffed with the expectation that
Sally's group handles the reporting and ongoing data maintenance type of
activities related to our risk management systems.
