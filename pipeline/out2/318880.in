1) re: revised project sched - plz see attached file.
updated scheds for both gtgs and hrsgs based on conversations today with s&s,
and nooter/deltak, respectively.
for the gtgs, time period from order to ex-works is 17 months.
for hrsgs, time period from order to ex-works is also 17 months.

with "delay" in ordering major equipment until funds released in mid-nov01,
the project's cod is delayed until april04; represents a worsening of the
schedule by 10 months.
