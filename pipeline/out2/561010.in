Joel has been negotiating with Open Text along with Ryan Orsak - as Enron has
been providing numerous resource hours testing their 'beta' product that
integrates Livelink with IRIMs for records management processes.  Our
experience has been that we are finding way too many problems and that the
product does not function as 'advertised'.  Therefore, Joel sought a credit
to reimburse Enron for the value of the testing we have performed for them.
The $30,000 software credit will likely be used to purchase the web front end
to the Livelink product.

Congratulations, Joel!
