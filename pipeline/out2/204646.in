Linda,
I talked with Linda and Michelle this week on this issue. What Michelle
wanted to know  was does TW have Operators who have PNR agreements.
Currently, TW does not have any operators with PNR agreements because they
have mandatory OBAs on TW. With our 637 compliance filing TW is requesting
that Operators move their imbalance to a PNR if it is over a certin volume.

Also EOG does pool on TW so as a shipper we could get them to enter into a
PNR. They would need to have a shipper transport it to and from the PNR point.
I also told Michelle that all points the flow any volumes on TW are required
to be an an OBA.
Michelle said that they were able to resolve this issue with EOG.

Thanks Ramona
