I have talked to Aquilla on several occasions (including today) and they
continue to say they are capable of playing by the rules.  I will talk to
them again tomorrow and suggest that we shut off their capability to trade
physical gas online (and vica versa for Aquila Energy Marketing).  They have
asked us not to do this however I believe it may be time to revisit this.  We
do have the legal ability to hold them to their click deals however they do
not have the contracts to manage physical gas. This would obviously make a
messy situation.  I suggest that you call Jennifer Denny, Torrey Moorer or
myself as soon as you see one of these transactions in the future as we can
check into it immediately.
All transactions that have occured will be assigned by Aquila to Aquila.
Mark Taylor will draft the agreements and Aquila has agreed to this.
