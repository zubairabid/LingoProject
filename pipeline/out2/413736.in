Following up on our conversation re: a visit to Santa Fe when you come to
Houston, check out the Website for The Bishop's Lodge in Santa Fe
(www.bishopslodge.com).   Some friends of mine bought a weekend there at a
silent auction at a charity event recently and their brochure looked great.
The website has pictures, prices, activities at the resort, and a hyperlink
to the Website for the Santa Fe Chamber of Commerce which lists the
activities going on in Santa Fe.  I think you are going to be too late for
their summer opera series, but I took a look and there appears to be other
fun things going on.  The website for the lodge shows a fabulous looking
pool, horseback riding and shooting.  Take a look.
