What do you guys think about this?
Interesting report on successful case brought against internet business
which suggests that internet businesses face increasing risk of being sued
in any jurisdiction in which their sites can be accessed. Ruling by New York
State Supreme Court.
Whilst dealing with gaming, as a criminal offence was likely to attract more
interest, offshore company had its computers in Antigua but held to be
governed by New York State gaming laws because New Yorkers were able to
access the site and place bets.
