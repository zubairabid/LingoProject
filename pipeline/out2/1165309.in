Mike Swerzbin told me Friday that he does not want us to pursue any action on
this which would involve tearing up the option trades.  He did what Richard
and I advised him to do,  he confronted Puget about it,  and is apparently
satisfied from that conversation that their intentions were not as foul as we
first suspected and seems willing to let the matter rest.
Steve Hall's call to the Puget attorney's, referred to below,  was quite
helpful in defusing the situation, although it really puzzles me why anybody
would take the time to make a filing at FERC, (for price caps in the NW)
just to show that another filing was ludicrous (price caps in California).
Seems like bad regulatory faith or something. ----cgy
