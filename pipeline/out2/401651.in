Bug had a busy Halloween at school- Big kids dressed up trick or treated at
all the classrooms and bug was the only baby still awake during this time so
they put her in a high chair to watch all of the action.  She fell asleep on
the short ride home which she never does. We bought her an outifit to wear
at Old Navy that's not really a "costume". It is an orange one piece thing
with these cute smiling spiders on it that says "silly spiders". It was a
little boyish, but the pumpkin motif suit was on white t-shirt material and
I knew it would be totally stained by the end of the day.  The orange hid
those pesky carrots and peaches! We took pictures of her holding on to the
gourd jack-o-lantern yesterday morning.  I think she enjoyed watching the
kids come to our door for candy, but she really didn't like the doorbell
much at all. The "Hamlets" slummed it and left their million dollar house
area of Alamo Heights to come trick or treat on the old street.  They
brought new baby whose name sounds like Frayton - not sure how to spell -
but it was fun to see them again. Well, we will hook up another weekend but
in the meantime I will send portraits and hopefully some other pics your
way.
