Yesterday, a number of parties to the Interruptible OII c.00-10-002) filed
their proposals forwhat changes should be made to the utilities'
interruptible programs. A summary of those filings will be distributed
later this week. In addition the Energy Producers and Users Coalition  filed
an emergency motion yesterday to make certain "refinements" to the
utilities' programs.
Specifically,the motionrequests that the Commission:
1. Order Edison and PG&E to implement Optional Binding Mandatory  Curtailment
(OBMC) programs for all distribution level customers. The OBMC  should
provide flexible program criteria, recognizing that not all customers  have
the same operational capability to control the manner and extent of
curtailment as envisioned by the Commission in directing the implementation
of  mandatory curtailment plans in D.91548;
2. Establish clear procedures by which customers who are not operationally
suited to participate in the OBMC but who face some level of increased
environmental damage, health or safety risk upon sudden curtailment may
qualify  under the "Essential Use" category of customers; and
3. Approve a new service alternative for customers that would experience a
disproportionate business interruption and economic impact upon
interruption.
Let me know if you want to see a copy of the motion.
