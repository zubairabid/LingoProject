Tony & Frazier -- several comments from TW Commercial.

Page 1:  Streamlined Credit -- what does "interested parties" mean? parties
interested in bidding, or parties interested in us having a look at their
credit ?  Probably need to make this clear; on first reading, looks like
obtaining credit approval ahead of time is optional.  (Don't we want everyone
to get approval ahead of bidding?).

Page 2:  you state that "individual bid transactions are kept confidential."
What is confidential:  the identity of the shipper?  the bid itself?  In TW's
IOS, we post the individual bids as they come in, but do not post the name of
the shipper.  We feel that the posting of the dollar amount bids helps us get
a higher rate as shippers bid against each other, and likewise recommend
online bids be posted in real time.  I notice you call them "sealed bids" on
page 4 -- not true if we're going to show them.

Page 3:  why not request a little more emphatically that shippers establish
creditworthiness at least several days in advance of bidding?  Especially
since we plan to attract brand-new shippers by offering this service.  Our
credit dept. folks would probably appreciate not having to do it all between
2 and 4 on bid day.

If we're asking that shippers submit bids to 3 decimal places, our example
should be to 3 decimal places (e.g., $0.351).

Page 7:  "an" Capacity Trading Agreement should be "a" Capacity Trading
Agreement.

Page 8:  So we don't appear low-tech, let's go ahead and tell shippers we
plan to have the Request for Service and the service agreement available for
online submittal at some point in the near future.

Also, we've never asked shippers to submit a Request for Service with each
bid.  A shipper may bid and re-bid several times over the bidding process.
They really only need to submit the Request for Service at the time of, or
prior to, the first bid.  I recommend stating "You must submit a Request for
Service prior to making your initial bid" so they don't think they have to
submit a new one every time they revise their bid.

Page 9:  Under "When TW will Respond":  need to specify how notification will
be sent.

Page 14:  Column that says "Price" should say "Rate" (for a second there we
thought you were talking about gas prices).  Also, please use example rates
that are more realistic for TW (in the $0.240 to $0.299 would be great...)

Thanks for all your hard work on this.  I'll be here if you have any
questions.
