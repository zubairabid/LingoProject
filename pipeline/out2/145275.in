I would call Kent and ask about this.  I would also remind him about our
request for the pressure data in the September 14 letter and their
obligations to keep pressures at the average pressure for the 3 year period
prior to the effect date of the agreement.
Mark,  We also need you to keep notes, with dates and times, of all your
discussions and communications with Wildhorse.  Dan, Has been preparing his
notes and you may want to just add onto his notes.
Dan,  I also need to get a copy of your notes when you get a chance.
