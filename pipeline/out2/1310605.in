JAMES:

Thank you very much for your comments.

I would like to take the following actions in regard to this information:

I would like to schedule a meeting with you and one or both of Todd Peterson and Tony Galt as soon as conveniently possible Monday, February 26 to discuss these and related issues.  I will ask Kathleen to schedule the meeting.

I would like you to take the lead in following up on a number of matters with Southern LNG (SLNG) and El Paso Merchant Energy (EPME).  I think you should do this verbally, with follow-up written confirmation.  Please ensure that we direct all correspondence to the proper corporate entities.  For example, FERC compliance matters should be addressed to El Paso Merchant Energy, with a copy to Southern LNG.  Correspondence directed to Southern LNG would have to deal with matters related to the Quality Letter Agreement or be in answering requests they direct to us.

I would like you to keep both Eric Groves and Rod Hayslett up to date on all cost related matters, so that the cost of service model being developed by Rod Hayslett and being incorporated into Eric Groves economics model is as accurate as possible.  When Rod transfers his COS model to Eric, we should be able to reduce our communications with Rod to an "as-required" basis.


You have made some excellent points in your note, and I believe we need to follow up on several of them, i.e.
spare parts - we have used the information supplied by Southern LNG, with the exception of the stripping facilities.  I think you are right.  I think we should include your estimates in the COS model.  However, I would not raise this with EPME/SLNG - we can discuss it at the time of the True-Up filing by SLNG.
O& M costs - in April 2000, SLNG did add to their fixed O&M costs, but not their variable ones.  I think the information supplied by SLNG in late 2000 does pick up increased O&M costs (in the fixed portion of the COS) and increased power costs.  I believe they have deliberately held the variable O&M costs at the same level as in April 2000 (by putting the increase in fixed O&M).
I think you should formalize a request to EPME. copy to SLNG, around dredging maintenance costs, broken out by category (i.e. berth, channel, proposed new turning basin, old turning basin, etc.)
I cannot find the $2,750,000 figure in your fifth point.  I have never tried to estimate maintenance dredging costs.
Your sixth point is one I had not even thought about - and you are right.  I forgot about the tug pilots.  I would like you to raise this issue with EPME, copy to SLNG.  If the pilots are on board 24 hours per day, 365 days per year (to escort 30 to 40 vessels past the dock each day, then I believe your cost estimate is too low.
We definitely need to include the EPME liquids stripping model economics in the COS model as one key alternative to handle high Btu content LNG.  Therefore, we need to ensure we obtain an as-accurate-as-possible assessment of all the costs.  The model will have the capability to handle several alternatives in this regard.


I would also like to discuss the following matters at the Monday meeting:
status of the British Gas marine study in general;
status of our initial views on Phase I of the British Gas marine study;
plans to deal with early release of study results to SLNG;
understanding of the marine consultant's conclusions around the two-tug-escort possibility (e.g. where would the tugs be located?  Would they tie onto the vessels?);
other ramifications of the "escort" proposal (liability, risk, insurance, owners' reaction, FERC-imposed-requirement versus USCG);
USCG preliminary report;
Enron initiatives with the USCG, tug owners, pilots, etc. everywhere on the ship side of the unloading flange; and
other (as may be brought forward).


Until Monday!
Les
