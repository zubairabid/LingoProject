Thanks for your front-end research on this.  It's too bad that the training
provider can't be as responsive!  In a trading organization, 2 to 3 months is
an eternity.  Sounds as if they are inflexible as well.  Our audience for
this training would be risk book adminstrators and traders, so 2 days away
from the desk is not very workable either.

After I get over my irritation at timing and inflexibility, I may want to
book them for September, although with a much smaller audience than would be
desireable if they insist on sticking to their 2 day method of delivery.
Could I get an outline of their 2 day course to review in order to make this
decision?  Thanks.  --Sally
