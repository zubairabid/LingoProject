Jim, I really don't see a need for this meeting - you can count on us not
dropping the ball.  I have a good understanding of the retail product
offering, in fact, we lead the outsourcing sales process for the large
industrial customers in NA until EES bought back their minority
shareholders.  I have a very good relationship with Dan Leff and Sunde.  I
already have Dan's committment to help service the execution of the business
initially.  As it grows and the product proves itself out we can staff.

Regards
Delainey
