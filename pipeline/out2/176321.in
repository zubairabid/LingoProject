David,
You have done a great job in putting this together and I would like to
endorse it. I have only two concerns that have been noted by others. First
as Mitch Wilk pointed out, the utilities were not required to sell their
power plants but they were encouraged to do so. Second, I agree with Bill
Hogan that the last paragraph of the Summary takes an unnecessary swipe at
the Governor. You may want to end the summary in the same tone you ended
the manifesto.
