There are prepayment penalties associated with IFC loans.  As to the lender
Veto, the Veto should only apply to the banks covered by their umbrella and
should not be applicable to the relationship to other MLA's or uncovered
lenders.  For instance if OPIC is lending $50MM, FMO $10MM, and the B banks
$40MM, the voting rights should be 50% for OPIC and 50% FMO (since FMO is the
lender of record for the B banks).  Unanimous consent items would then
require both OPIC and FMO to consent.
