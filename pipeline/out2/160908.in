The Senate Energy, Utilities and Communications Committee held a hearing
on February 8 entitled; California,s Energy Supply; Will it Be Full
Power Ahead or Lights Out?  Legislators in attendance for all or part of
the hearing included Senators Bowen, Peace, Vasconcellos, Alarcon and
Speier.   Dave Parquet was one of the presenters.  I will send handouts
from the meeting to Joseph tonight.

This was the first of several planned informational hearings for
stakeholders to express their points of view on California,s projected
energy needs, hindrances to meeting those needs, and possible
solutions.  We expect future hearings to deal more with possible
solutions rather then simply providing a broad overview.
