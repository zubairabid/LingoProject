Just wanted to let you know I haven't forgotten you. All our traders and
schedulers have been in a meeting this afternoon, and as soon as they got out
the frenzy of trading and scheduling began again. I'm going to give things a
minute to settle down, and then ask around as to how people would like their
Livelink training.

I'll get back to you soon.
