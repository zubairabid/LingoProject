Three problems with this Draft.
1.  In Paragraph 1.1, they removed my requirement of installing a system to
meet "all of Enron's electrical power requirements for the Driver".  My
concern here is that they put in equipment that is not adequate to handle our
load requirements.  At a minimum we should state a specific load requirement
for this station.  E.g. 10,000 HP.
2.  In Paragraph 1.1, they inserted a requirement that Plain's approve any
in-service date for the driver and that the Telecommunication Equipment would
be in-service by such date.  My draft had a date established by Enron solely
and Plains would have to meet such date.  I think we need control of our
in-service date without Plains prior approval.  We will be reasonable in
establishing such date.
3.  Plains disclaims all warranties with respect to the Telecommunication
Equipment.  This was not in the first draft.  We need some assurance that
this equipment will do the job we need it to.
I would be happy to discuss these directly with Plains' attorneys at their
convenience.
