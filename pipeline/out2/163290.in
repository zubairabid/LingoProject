How come FERC has finalized their report without our comments?!  We need to
be prepared to respond when they issue their report -- we can line up
broadcast interviews (CNBC, CNN) in response -- and also target specific
publications.  We'll need to prepare "sound bite" messages based on our
filing (I haven't seen it yet, but Mary Hain is supposed to be sending it).
Keep me posted on the time and place of the Nov. 1 press conference.  Also,
are we participating in the Nov. 9 public hearing?  Let me know. thx. kd
