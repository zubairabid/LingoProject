As to your question about what's going on in California, I've done some
reading and here are my thoughts.
The Nov. 1 FERC order in Docket No. EL00-95-000, in which the Commission
ordered a $150/MWh price cap (among other things), was predicated on the
Commission's authority under Section 206 of the Federal Power Act.
Specifically, the FPA provides that if the Commission finds that "any rate,
charge or classification for jurisdictional services, or any rule,
regulation, practice or contract affecting such rate, charge or
classification" is unjust or unreasonable, the Commission shall determine the
just and reasonable rate, charge, classification, rule, regulation, practice,
or contract that should be in effect.  The Commission recognized that certain
areas of the flawed California market are not within its jurisdiction, but
"fixed" the areas within its jurisdiction.   Apparently the California
governor agrees with me that the Commission's jurisdiction in the area of
wholesale electricity prices is questionable...
In any event, if the Commission wanted to open a proceeding to investigate
the justness and reasonableness of negotiated gas transportation rates, its
authority to do so would be much clearer.  The Natural Gas Act expressly
authorizes FERC to declare unlawful any transportation rate that is not just
and reasonable.  "Just and reasonable" has been interpreted in many different
contexts and the Commission has significant discretion over what it means.
As we all know too well, the Commission sometimes acts unpredictably.
However, my feeling is that it will probably take more than 2 or 3
above-max-rate contracts to motivate the FERC to act to declare a negotiated
rate deal, struck within a pipeline's tariff authority, to be unjust and
unreasonable.  The California proceeding was initiated after entire
communities of individual consumers suffered 200-300% increases in their
electricity bills.  The prices for electricity in California were outrageous
across the board and affected everyone in the state.  By contrast, TW's
transport rates for its short-term deals are far removed from end user prices
and the practice of negotiating higher than max rate deals is probably not
widespread enough for anyone to notice.  It is far from being a consumer
issue, and besides, the elections are over.  However, as you and I have
already discussed, we must be wary of parties like Dynegy that do notice just
about everything and who might try to draw it to FERC's attention.  We do
need to watch to see whether other pipelines serving California are doing the
same types of deals.  Kathy, why don't you and I discuss a system of
monitoring the contract information postings of El Paso, Kern, PGT/NW.  Drew,
obviously I've only scratched the surface here so let's talk if you want a
more in-depth report.
