Colleen,

Thanks for the heads up on this.  We would be pleased to look into this when
the time is right from your perspective.   Let us know.   Please follow-up
with Mike Rogala or me.

FYI - there were some conversations with ProStaff earlier this year around
the same topic and I believe the conclusion was that their bandwidth needs to
were too small to be interesting.   I would recommend that we get some sizing
info from Corestaff up front so we can determine whether it is worth their
time and ours.

Thanks again,

Brad
