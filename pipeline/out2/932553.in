On January 12, I hosted a brainstorming session at the Four Seasons hotel in
downtown Houston in which we assembled a number of ideas regarding mid and
back office services we could offer to the commodity industry.  To complete a
plan for launching this strategic commercial venture, we are hosting an
integrated design session facilitated by Cap Gemini Ernst & Young (CGEY) at
their Accelerated Solutions Environment in Dallas, Texas.

I am personally extending an invitation to you to participate in this design
session.  This is a critical two-day event to be held February 12th and 13th
in Dallas, Texas.   This work session is based on a unique approach called a
DesignShopv.  It is a very focused, activity-driven event that is composed of
various modules and exercises performed in small and large groups. If you
have not attended one of the DesignShops related to SAP, you will likely
regard this session as different from any working session you have previously
experienced. The prior DesignShops held in conjunction with SAP have proven
to be very successful.  Therefore, we have elected to utilize this same
methodology on this very critical and strategic venture.

A limited number of representatives from Enron will be attending.  You were
selected to be one of approximately 30 key individuals to participate in the
DesignShop. You are being asked to participate in the full two days with as
little distraction or interruption as possible.  The quality of our results
depends on each participant being fully engaged and participative for the
entire event.   Additionally, you will be relied on in the future to support
and communicate our commercial strategy as it is defined at this session.
This date was specifically selected to avoid critical operational periods so
that your participation can be maximized. Therefore, please make all
necessary arrangements at the office to minimize your distractions during
these two days.

Please review the attached information regarding hotel, flight information,
and transportation.  Preliminary information as to schedule and environment
has also been included.  You may direct any additional questions concerning
the event to Mary Solmonson at (713)-853-6079.

I hope that you will be able to participate.  Please confirm your attendance
for the two days with Marvia Jefferson at 713-853-9165 by January 29th 5:00
p.m.  If you are unable to attend, it may be appropriate to select someone
else to participate.  Please do not extend an invitation to anyone else to
take your place until you and I have discussed this.

I thank you in advance for your participation and look forward to seeing you
in Dallas!
