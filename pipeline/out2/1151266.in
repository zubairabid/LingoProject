Tim,
This kind of information is very helpful for those of us who will be trying
to make our way through the Market Monitoring investigation.  Please keep
forwarding everything like it that you come upon.  Elizabeth said by voice
mail Thursday, that she is going to be lining up our outside counsel to work
on this and would be calling you soon.  I am going to be out of the office
from June 30 -July 14.

Some of what is expressed in the conversation about the incident is
consistent  with one of my own instincts about the matter, which is that
nobody, including the PX Compliance folks,  should be surprised to learn
that   the competitive market forces that  everybody seems to agree are very
positive are going to be applied directly to the electronic system qua
system.  Dynamic electronic commerce is going to include a rigorous testing
of the very media by which it is conducted.  The politicians whose supposed
wisdom  created this mode of commerce and imposed it upon the California
energy market   can't expect to channel the enormous brawling competitive
energy of a big sector of the American economy into  a  computer software
system and then throw up their hands and interpret certain kind of
commercial  results from the perspective of the  good old days of
pre-electronic commerce.   Certain kinds of distortions are going to happen
in electronic commerce which would not happen in the absence of this mode of
conducting business, and these new  kinds of distortions are going to warp
and twist the system.  Presumably those devoted to keeping the system will
try to repair it and improve it,  but in doing so,  they need to procede very
carefully down any path that  might lead to pointing an accusing figure at
any one particular market participant.  Arguably a big finger might be
pointed at those that created this market distorting  mess in the first
place. --cgy
