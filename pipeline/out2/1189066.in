As you may recall, GAO interviewed ISDA in December of last year for the
purposes of compiling information for their electronic trading report.  GAO
has forwarded the attached copy of the draft report for ISDA's review.  ISDA
staff will be reviewing the report and welcome your suggestions and
comments.  Please forward your comments to me by April 6.

Many thanks!
