I know that it is a finesse but I would rather not have a specific date
(although we would prefer a specific date relative to no clarity on this
matter):
If I were writing it it would something like:
In no case shall the rate freeze, as defined by AB1890, end before the CPUC
has determined replacement rates.  And in no case shall such determination of
replacement rates,  beyond the end of AB 1890 term (Mar 2002).
Such wording means supports our claim of negative ctc up to new setting of
rates.  It also allows us to argue with customers that we switched them for
their own good.
