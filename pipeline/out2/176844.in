Attached you will find an outline of the Federal Court litigation filed by
SCE against the CPUC.  SCE's request for a preliminary injunction is
scheduled to be heard tomorrow, and a decision tomorrow is possible.  PG&E
has filed a similar action, but its claims are not scheduled to be heard
tomorrow.

In summary:
The utilities are seeking an order permitting them to recover their past and
future undercollections
They are not directly asking the court to determine that the rate freeze has
ended
Potential outcome is that the court permits SCE (and, later, PG&E) to recover
these undercollections and orders the CPUC to hold hearings on how to
structure the recovery
Appeal by either side is likely
