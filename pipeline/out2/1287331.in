1. Update on NGPL Interconnect in Eddy County

2.  Producer Activity around Atoka

3.  New Agave gathering line into West Texas Lateral

4.  PDI Study


Follow up notes from our meeting in January,

TW no longer owns any mainline south of the Crawford compressor.  These lines have been sold to Duke Energy.  Parallel to the Crawford lateral 16" line is another 8" line, now also owned by Duke.

Also, according to Susan Scott, our legal counsel, no issues exist as to TW not being able to spin down assets.  We would just need to file abandonment procedures with FERC.  Any new asset owner would need to honor the existing contracts through their original term.

We'll talk more tomorrow.
