Steve,   As we just discussed, this is the transition memo suggesting that
you place a call to Clay Johnson.   As noted in the memo, we are still
working through with the lawyers what leave status our employees would be
required to take while serving on the private transition and the publicly
funded transition.  The answer to this question may determine their
willingness to serve, in some cases.
