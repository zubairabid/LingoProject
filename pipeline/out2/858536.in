Player UpdatesNBA Reports
Latest NBA Player News

Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/10/00
The 76ers placed Snow on the injured list with a stress fracture in his
right ankle. Snow, who plays point guard next to star Allen Iverson,
underwent a CT scan Thursday that revealed the stress fracture. He is
expected to be out for six to eight weeks.

Kenny Anderson , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00
The Celtics activated Anderson on Sunday and placed guard Chris Carr on the
injured list with a sprained left ankle.   Anderson had been on the injured
list since Nov. 6 with a fractured jaw. He had a wire removed from his jaw
Dec. 6 and was cleared to practice Dec. 7. He missed 16 games with the
injury.

Erick Strickland , G NY - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00
Strickland sat out Saturday's home game against Denver due to a bruised
leg.  He was a valuable Fantasy player as a member of the Dallas Mavericks
last season but is limited now by his lack of playing time with the Knicks.


Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/10/00
Davis missed his second straight start for the Sonics because of a sprained
ankle. Forward Ruben Patterson started in place of Davis, with Rashard Lewis
moving to shooting guard.  Davis is a solid ballhandler and defender but
doesn't have much Fantasy value.

Elliot Perry , G PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
The Suns have signed veteran guard Elliot Perry.  He will be used primarily
as Jason Kidd's backup but has limited Fantasy value.

Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Dudley was activated from the injured list and started in Thursday's game at
Milwaukee.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley could be of good use in
a larger Fantasy league, but don't use him in a smaller one.

Ruben Garces , F PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Garces was placed on the injured list to make room for C Chris Dudley.
Garces is suffering from a bulging disc in his back.  He is used primarily as
a third center so he doesn't have a lot of Fantasy value.

Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Marshall had missed the two games prior to Thursday's action because of a
sprained knee, but returned to the lineup against Vancouver and had seven
points and three rebounds in 14 minutes.  Because Marshall comes off the
bench he doesn't have much Fantasy value.  But with him back in the rotation
forwards Karl Malone and Bryon Russell will play less minutes now.

Carlos Rogers , F HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Rogers will be sidelined indefinitely after suffering a sprained knee.  He
is a reserve forward with very little Fantasy value but his absence will
force the starting frontcourt to play more minutes.  This could have positive
or negative affects on their production.  If you have Houston frontcourt
players on your roster monitor them to see if they flourish or flounder under
the current conditions.

Donnell Harvey , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Harvey has been activated from the injured list to make room for the injured
Greg Buckner.  Harvey is a solid rebounder but won't receive enough playing
time to be a valuable Fantasy player.

Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Buckner will undergo surgery early next week to remove a cracked bone spur
on his right foot.  The surgery could sideline Buckner for 6-8 weeks.  Rookie
Donnell Harvey was activated form the injured list to make room for
Buckner.   This is the second time this season that he has been sidelined
with the same injury.  Fantasy owners should avoid Buckner for he rest of the
season or until he is playing and producing on a consistent basis again.

Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/08/00
Oakley has served his league-imposed suspension and is eligible to return to
the Raptors' lineup for Friday night's game at Golden State.  "Oak," who was
suspended for punching Clippers' point guard Jeff McInnis, has Fantasy value
as a rebounder only, and isn't considered a real commodity outside of deeper
leagues.

Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/08/00
Although the team is calling him a game-time decision, it looks as though
Carter will return to the court on Friday night against the Golden State
Warriors.  Carter practiced with the team on Thursday, and is exciting about
the prospect of playing against his former Tar Heel teammate,  Antawn
Jamison. All signs point towards Carter's return by this weekend at the very
latest, so add a little "Vinsanity" to your starting lineup next week.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/08/00
Hill was a game time scratch on Thursday night against the Nuggets. The
Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to return to the court on
Monday when the Magic travel to Los Angeles for a date with the Clippers.
Hill's return is long overdue for Fantasy owners who held onto his rights
this season. Unless you have a number of solid forwards on your roster, give
Hill the start this week pending any setbacks.

Hidayet Turkoglu , G SAC - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00
Turkoglu is suffering from a shoulder injury and is questionable for
Friday's game against Houston.  He is a key reserve on the Kings' team but
has very little Fantasy value.

Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00
Nash returned to action against the Knicks Wednesday after missing two
straight games because of a calf injury.  He didn't seem to be bothered by
the injury as he scored 14 points and dished off for six assists.  It is now
safe to play Nash on your Fantasy team again.

Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00
Marshall is recovering from a sprained knee and is questionable for
Thursday's game against the Grizzlies.  Look for starters Bryon Russell and
Karl Malone to play extra minutes in his absence.  Avoid using Marshall until
he appears to be fully recovered.

Kevin Garnett , F MIN - Farragut Academy Updated 12/07/00
Garnett hurt his right ring finger in Tuesday's game and was scheduled to
have it examined Wednesday.  He is expected to play against the Wizards
Thursday.  Monitor Garnett's situation.  Something as simple as an injured
finger on his shooting hand could lead to an offensive slump and affect his
Fantasy numbers.

Terry Davis , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00
Davis will be eligible to come off the injured list Sunday but Achilles
tendonitis in his right leg is expected to keep him sidelined a little bit
longer.  He has been injury prone throughout his career and doesn't have much
Fantasy value.

Antonio McDyess , F DEN - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00
McDyess suffered a bruised right shin in Wednesday's game against the Heat
and is questionable for Thursday's matchup against the Magic.  Keon Clark
will start at power forward if McDyess is unable to play.  The leg is sore
now but look for McDyess to be back to normal in a few days.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/07/00
Hill may be ready to return to the court for Thursday night's game against
the Nuggets. He has missed most of the season with an ankle injury, but he
practiced on Wednesday, and all indications signal his return to the court.
"I can't give you the official thumbs up," said Head Coach Doc Rivers, "but
it looks good." Fantasy owners who have been waiting for Hill's return will
likely get him back in time for next week, when Orlando embarks on a
four-game West Coast road trip.

Gary Trent , F DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/07/00
According to The Dallas Morning Star Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is hopeful
that Trent will travel on the Mavericks' next road trip, a six-game swing on
the East Coast.  Trent is not expected to be activated on the trip but could
be back in action in another two weeks.  He has been sidelined since the
first preseason game with a strained upper abductor muscle.  Trent is a good
inside scorer and a solid rebounder but is injury prone.  When he does return
Fantasy owners should refrain from picking him up unless they desperately
need a forward.

Stephon Marbury , G NJ - The Old School Fools Updated 12/07/00
Marbury missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night because of an
ankle injury. He turned the ankle last  Friday night in Orlando, then turned
it again the following night against the Magic back in New Jersey. He is
still lacking some of his explosiveness, but says that the pain in the ankle
is diminishing. Marbury hopes to return on Friday night when the Nets host
the Phoenix Suns. Fantasy owners who lost Marbury last week should have their
star point guard back in time for next week's roster changes.

Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00
Carter was in uniform for Wednesday night's game against Portland, but he
didn't see any playing time. "Air Canada" said that he felt well enough to
play, but team doctors wouldn't give him permission to get in the game. "We'd
like to have him back as soon as possible," said Head Coach Lenny Wilkens,
"but we're not going to bring him back before he's ready." Toronto finishes
their three-game West Coast swing on Friday night against Golden State, at
which time Carter hopes to make his return. The Raptors' star should be back
before Monday, so most Fantasy owners can re-insert him into their lineup in
time for next week.

Andre Miller , G CLE - The Rounders Updated 12/07/00
Miller took a knee to the nose during Wednesday night's game at Chicago
which sent him to the bench temporarily. He returned to the game with a
vengeance, finishing with 20 points, 14 assists and seven rebounds in
Cleveland's 92-88 victory. The shot to the nose won't keep Miller from
missing any playing time, so continue to use the young point guard in your
starting lineup.

Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/07/00
Brand missed his second consecutive game on Wednesday night against
Cleveland. He is reportedly making progress with his hyperextended left knee,
and has been able to run on a treadmill this week.  Brand is listed as day to
day, and says that he has about a 50 percent chance of playing on Friday
night against Dallas. With most roster changes occurring on Monday, Fantasy
owners should be able to put the Bulls' star back in their lineup for next
week's games.

Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/06/00
The 76ers will be without Snow for six to eight weeks after a CT scan
Wednesday showed a stress fracture in his right ankle. He was second on the
team with a career-high 12.2 ppg, and led the Sixers with 6.6 assists per
contest. Although Philadelphia sports a deep roster, one can't help but
assume this will have an impact on the team's fortunes for Fantasy purposes.

Chris Dudley , C PHO - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00
Dudley will travel with the Suns on their end of the week road-trip that
starts in Milwaukee Thursday.  He will most likely be questionable for all
the games.  Look for him to finally return to action next week.  With Dudley
out of the lineup Corie Blount and rookie Daniel Santiago will continue to
get playing time.  With the lack of depth at center, Dudley's rebounding
makes him a starter on your Fantasy team if you are using a reserve in his
position.

Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/06/00
Mills is doubtful for Wednesday's game against the Lakers because of pain in
his right ankle.  He was scheduled to see a foot specialist on Tuesday and
underwent surgery last season to remove bone spurs from the ankle.  Sit Mills
on your Fantasy bench for now.  If you are playing in a small league drop him
from your roster and add another forward.

Ron Mercer , G CHI - The Old School Fools Updated 12/06/00
Mercer sat out of Tuesday's game against the T'Wolves because of the flu.
Corey Benjamin started at shooting guard in place of Mercer.  Mercer's status
for Wednesday's game is up in the air.  He has been a major disappointment so
far this season.  If you play in a deep Fantasy league keep him on your
roster, if you are in a smaller one look to make an upgrade at guard.  The
way Mercer has been producing you shouldn't have a hard time finding a better
guard.
