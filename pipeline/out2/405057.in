Hey Darren,

It's funny you mentioned Wilson because I just got an email from him this
morning.  He seems to think he'll be in Houston in the near future as well.
Hopefully, we can all get together and go out or hit steak night for some
cold ones.  So H-town for six weeks hugh?  Why the mixed feelings?  Are they
work related or were you just starting to get settled in London?  Anyway,
I'll have to give Nick a call about the big news...I may have an idea what
it's all about but then again maybe not.  So what's with this Kiwi girl?
Because, I actually have made some progress regarding London.  Turns out
there may be some structuring and originating opportunities for me over there
which would be much more in line with where I'd like my "career" to be going
versus the other opportunities I was being offered.  Either way, I won't be
going over until March or April of next year so it's still a ways off.

As for the guy scene...yes, there has been some courting but nothing really
to speak of.  I've gone out on a couple of dates but I can't say I really see
them going anywhere.  Most of the guys around my age are still pretty
insecure and I'm never going to be the kind of girl that wants to "shape and
mold them" into men...I just don't have the patience or the inclination.  And
the other end of the spectrum (single guys in their late 30's/early 40's) who
seem to hover around like gnats just give me the creeps.  Oh well, as I've
said before "hope springs eternal".

Talk to you soon,
Susan
