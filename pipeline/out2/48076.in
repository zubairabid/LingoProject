Greetings,
I would suggest calling Duke early to make sure that they are aware of this
obligation.    They need to resupply for this hour, regardless of their cost.
If they pull up lame,  of  course,  we will resupply and bill them LD.
If you have major problems with this,  dont hesitate to call Donald or myself.

Thanks,
JMF
