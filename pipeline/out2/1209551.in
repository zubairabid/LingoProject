Marie -
I have reviewed the changes you have requested for the US Bandwidth
products.  Please be advised that the process of revising the product types
and variables comprising the products will be substantial.

7 Bandwidth product type descriptions will need to be rewritten (1 product
name has been changed).
The reference period description will need to be revised.
68 Bandwidth locations will need to be revised.
Note:  Although Legal has requested a change, "Currency" CANNOT be revised.
The Unit of Measurement description has been revised and in addition also
includes refererence to a "Service Level Agreement."

In order to apprise the EOL team of the changes, please note that Legal has
revised the Bandwidth GTC's and requested changes to the following 7 product
descriptions:

US Bandwidth DS-3 Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-12c Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-48c Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-3 Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth OC-3c Phy Fwd
US Bandwidth STM-1 Phy Fwd
In addition, Legal has revised the product description:
US Bandwidth DW-48 Phy Fwd has been changed to US Bandwidth 2.5G Naval Phy Fwd

(Marie, please note that the Premium and Standard Service IP products will
not be revised since their descriptions were created for a one-time
demonstration).

For EOL purposes, please note that the product types should include the
reference to the transaction as being "A US Transaction."  You have requested
the following changes:

e.g.:  Product Type (for DS-3 to be revised from):

"A US Bandwidth Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. ("EBS")
pursuant to which the Seller shall sell and the Buyer shall buy the quantity
of Bandwidth Units submitted by Counterparty via the Website. The number of
DSO's per DS3 is 672. The price shall be as submitted by the Counterparty via
the Website. Any party entering into a Transaction to buy or sell Bandwidth
Units from or to EBS shall be responsible for connecting to the Demarcation
Point located at each Market Pooling Point in order to take physical delivery
of such Bandwidth.  In order to achieve such connectivity, a party may incur
costs and expenses and may additionally be required to execute certain
documentation."

to (note: insert "US"):

"A US Transaction with Enron Broadband Services, L.P. ("Company") for the
purchase and sale of Bandwidth pursuant to which Seller shall sell and  Buyer
shall buy the number of units of Bandwidth ("Bandwidth Units") submitted by
Counterparty via the Website. The number of DS-0s per DS-3 is 672. The price
