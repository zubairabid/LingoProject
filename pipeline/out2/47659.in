BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

BA&R Merchant Finance
Not your typical "bean counters", the BA&R Merchant Finance group is
responsible for maintaining and reporting the accounting valuations of the
ENA merchant portfolio, coordinating the quarterly revaluation of the
portfolio and directing the Arthur Andersen quarterly review (during earnings
release) and year end audit.  Customers include ENA Office of the Chair,
Corporate Reporting group during quarterly earnings release, commercial
groups, RAC groups and other commercial support groups.  The group supports
the accounting and reporting needs of the Principal Investments, Energy
Capital Resources, Generation Investments, Special Assets and Portfolio
commercial groups.  With the recent realignment of ENE lines of businesses,
the group has recently been involved in the successful transition of merchant
assets into newly formed Enron Global Markets.  The group has also been
heavily involved in complex hedging structures allowing ENA to effectively
hedge a significant portion of the portfolio.  What's next?  Bean counting is
probably not on the list!

EnTelligence?
No, its not spelled wrong, it's the name of a prospecting website in ENA
designed to deliver market information on existing and potential customers to
commercial trading, mid-marketing, and origination teams.  It also delivers
management reports to analyze Enron,s position within the key industries that
we serve.  Presently, commercial groups have multiple methods for acquiring
potential customer information.  This system will standardize their resource
tools and add consistency to their prospecting processes.  EnTelligence
combines information from internal databases such as Global Counterparty,
Credit Aggregation System (CAS), Sitara, Enpower, and ERMS with information
from external data sources such as Dun & Bradstreet and I.H.S Energy Reporter
to identify customer prospects.  By providing the capability to filter and
search by region, industry, company size, or energy consumption levels, the
prospecting process is shortened and the identification of strong prospects
improved. Available reports include Market Penetration, Industry Prospecting,
Comparison Prospecting, Company Profiles, Family Tree, Top Customers, and
Inactive Accounts.  Currently only Natural Gas and Power physical deals are
loaded, but financial deals will be included in mid-January, and new products
are soon to follow.  Check it out at http://entelligence.enron.com.

West Power Trading
Enron West Power Trading has two basic operations, Power Trading and
Origination.  The Power Trading Group consists of real-time, day-ahead, term
trading, and Middle Marketing.   Much of the hour-ahead and cash trading is
centered on the California Power Exchange and the California ISO markets,
along with bilateral trading both inside and outside of California.  The term
traders and middle marketers often rely on EnronOnline, the world's largest
e-commerce Web site, as a key component in futures transactions.

The Origination Group plays an instrumental role by developing and executing
strategic transactions with wholesale customers.  Services offered by the
Origination Group include asset and resource management, asset development
and construction, structuring long-term physical and financial contracts, and
the evaluation of asset acquisition and joint mergers.

NEWS FROM THE GLOBALFLASH

Enron Direct
Enron Direct was recently cited by Ofgem for high complaint levels with
regard to account complaints per total customers served.  Enron Direct views
the Ofgem customer service measures very seriously and is committed to
improving all aspects of its customer service - even while enjoying continued
strong growth in its retail commodity business.   However, the account
complaint level measure is particularly biased against fast-growing new
entrants like Enron Direct.  Since all of Enron Direct's customers have
recently switched suppliers - which is when most complaints occur - and our
total customer base is far lower than that of the RECs, our account complaint
levels per customer tend to appear inflated versus the REC peer group.   In
fact, Enron Direct's complaint levels for both transfers (i.e., switchers)
and mis-selling, as measured by Ofgem, were well below industry averages.
While we are not yet best-in-class, Enron Direct's portrayal as an industry
laggard in any aspect of customer service is misleading.  Stay tuned.

Relations with UPM-Kymmene
As previously announced, Enron Nordic Energy has entered into a two year
energy portfolio management agreement with UPM-Kymmene, the forestry industry
enterprise.  This deal creates huge potential for business opportunities
across a wide range of areas for Enron.

As part of the agreement, UPM-Kymmene has requested a dedicated account
manager in Oslo.  In order to comply with this request, we have appointed
Sami Tenngren on a full time basis to establish the operational framework and
to coordinate all Enron relations with UPM-Kymmene regarding power related
issues.

It is important that all Enron businesses take advantage of this unique
opportunity to generate profitable business relations with UPM-Kymmene. If
you would like to discuss new business opportunities related to worldwide
power with UPM-Kymmene, please contact the Nordic Origination Team. Please
also keep us informed about any other business development issues related to
UPM-Kymmene within other parts of Enron.

Australia
The Sydney Metals Desk is now fully manned. Welcome to Owen Murphy,  Max
Sobal and Robert Heynen to the Sydney Office.  The Metals Group is already
reviewing the possibilities of utilizing the existing metals customer base in
Australia to expand these relationships to include power supply/pricing, a
large component of overall costs.  While in its early days, our preliminary
discussions on the idea of pricing for power in relation to metal price is
receiving a positive response.
