I spoke to Glenn Leslie and Web Macdonald today about how to make the most of
the meeting next week on Thursday, July 20 in Calgary.  We agreed that Web's
group would prepare a synopsis of the facts as known to date and that each of
Seabron Adamson, Larry Ruff and the Optimum Group would be asked to prepare
for circulation in advance of the meeting a brief document with their initial
thoughts and observations on the basis of the briefing materials already
provided to them.  That material would be circulated in advance of the
meeting.  The meeting would begin witha discussion of and clarification of
the facts and then proceed to a discussion of the work of our various
experts.  The meeting is scheduled to commece at 8 am in Blakes Calgary
office.  Let me know if you have any questions or comments.  Aleck
