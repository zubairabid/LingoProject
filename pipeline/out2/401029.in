Let me clarify two of the more substantive matters that were not included in
the errata - Wheeler Ridge and the Pooling Revisions. The first, Wheeler
Ridge, was not included in the errata because of concerns expressed by IP and
ORA about the impact these changes would have on Kern River shippers.
SoCalGas did not oppose the revision and would accept the language as
proposed by PG&E, especially if it would gain their non-opposition. There
was also a concern expressed by some parties that the WR revisions went
beyond the bounds of an errata and should be considered a revision of the
settlement. As for the Pooling Revisions, Dynegy expressed reservations
about the proposed changes that included substantial increases in the number
of pools available per shipper. Dynegy was not able to garner internal
approval in time for us to prepare the errata for filing later today, so
Pooling revisions were taken off the table. SoCalGas supports the pooling
revisions and no other party expressed any concerns. ALJ Biren asked us to
file a revised settlement document with the corrected pages included and to
mail it out to the parties today, so our already compressed deadline for
getting this out the door was even more compressed.
Since I was unable to get resolution from all of the parties of the
outstanding differences, I could not include the revisions that were
circulated (to our dismay). PG&E has now indicated they will file limited
opposition and they have now served a discovery request upon SoCalGas with
regard to Wheeler Ridge.
