I attach the latest stats for the website. We are still getting an average of
over 500 visitors per day, with an average stay of about 11 minutes.



I also attach links to the proposed additions to the website for this month.

We are adding two new educational sections describing risk management and
weather derivatives and a new calculator to give consumers an ability to
calculate how much their electricity costs will increase as fuel prices
increase. We have also improved the navigation around the site.

A feature article comparing the dereg experience in the telecom sector and
the tactics used by the incumbent monopoly NTT with the electricity sector
will follow shortly.

kind regards
