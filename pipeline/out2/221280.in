This meeting will be held on 12/13 starting at 8:30 AM in 3AC19C1.  In order
to ensure the meeting moves quickly, please provide a pre-rating to me for
each of your employees.  I need these ratings by 5:00 PM on 12/8/00 to ensure
they are loaded for the meeting.  To help you pre-rate your employees, the
Corporate distribution is as follows:
5% Superior
30% Excellent
30% Strong
20% Satisfactory
15% Needs Improvement/Issues
Business units are expected to meet these targets or do their best to meet
these targets.  However, no rankings will be forced.    Please keep this
distribution handy when pre-rating employees.  If you need any help, please
feel free to call me.  Thanks!
