I could let the fluff comment fly if you were referring to a woman that had
written such works in present day, but given that Austen was dealing with a
completely different world with decidedly different expectations for the
women in it  I cannot.  The fact that she was able to challenge those limited
expectations and never allow her heroines to sell themselves short or
compromise their character should not be taken for granted.  Yes, there is a
definite romantic bent to her works, but in addition their is amazing insight
into people, their motives, their struggles and their capacity to surprise
even themselves.  And in the end, what conquers in her novels is the union of
two individuals who have the utmost respect and appreciation for each other's
minds and characters not the unequal and servile relationships that
constituted the norm for that time.
