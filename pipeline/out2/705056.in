The environmental clearances are still in effect as long as we stay on our
right of way and in our measuring station yard.  For any construction work at
the PG&E station, we will need written aprpoval from PG&E.  I  will notify
the state and county of California when we do the construction work.  Earl, I
will need to know the amount  of natural gas which will be released during
the blowdown of the 1850 feet of pipe, our separator and meter tubes.  Pg&E
will be responsible for the notification of gas release for their separator
and piping....
