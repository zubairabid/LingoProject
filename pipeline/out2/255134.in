Mary Ellen could you help me with two matters:
1.  Before we make the final decision on selecting a consultant group on team
building for EOTT's leadership, I would
like to meet with the principals.  Could you please give me their phone
numbers.

2.  And following up on an earlier request could you please give me the
ratings and rankings of our employee group that we
conducted at the end of 1999.

Thanks for your help.
