Probably after laughing on
Homecoming weekend,
Watching old alumni drunk off
their collective ass.
Somewhere between day one and year
four,
The best years of your life were
spent.
And looking back with a smile and
a sigh,
You wonder where those years went.
You try to figure out who made you
a victim,
Of the most serious crime,
You offer a reward for any
information leading,
To the one who stole the time.
The day is coming closer, and
closer,
Until one day it will be your
last,
And someone is guilty of doing
this to you,
The years have gone way too fast.
Sometime when you were too busy to
notice,
Happy as a newborn pup,
Someone came along and did the
unthinkable.
Somebody grew us up.
