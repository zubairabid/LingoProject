Player UpdatesNBA Reports
Latest NBA Player News

Terry Mills , F IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Mills was placed on the injured list by the Pacers on Wednesday with a
sprained right ankle. In four games this season, Mills has averaged 2.5
points and 1.5 rebounds for the Pacers. He has no Fantasy value.

Bruno Sundov , C IND - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Sundov was activated from the injured list by the Indiana Pacers on Tuesday.
He averaged 2.3 points and 1.0 rebounds in three games this season. Don't
bother wondering if he has any Fantasy value - Sundov will likely spend most
of his time on the Pacers' bench.

Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Walker has been activated from the injured list by the San Antonio Spurs. In
nine games this season, Walker averaged 2.1 points and 2.2 rebounds per game.
He has no Fantasy value.

Shawnelle Scott , C SA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Scott was placed on the injured list by the Spurs with tendinitis in his
left knee. In just four games this season, Scott posted a total of three
points and eight rebounds. Don't expect any type of Fantasy production from
Scott this season.

Kelvin Cato , C HOU - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Cato joined the team in San Francisco and will practice Wednesday.  He is
not expected to be activated for Thursday's game with the Warriors but expect
him to return befor next week.  Cato is a good rebounder  and shot blocker
but he doesn't play enough to have value in smaller Fantasy leagues.

Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Richardson missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is
listed as day-to-day. Richardson has played well since Tyrone Nesby was
traded to Washington, but his Fantasy value is still very questionable. Keep
track of  Richardson to see if he can post any consistent numbers before
considering him for your roster.

Darius Miles , F LAC - Farragut Academy Updated 12/13/00
Miles missed practice on Tuesday because of flu-like symptoms. He is listed
as day-to-day. The rookie has averaged only 6.2 points per game thus far, and
has no real Fantasy value at this point in the season.

Kobe Bryant , G LAL - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/13/00
Bryant jammed his right little finger on a dunk during Tuesday night's loss
to the Bucks. He continued to play with his finger wrapped, finishing the
game with 25 points on only 8-of-31 shooting. The diagnosis on the finger was
only a sprain, and X-rays were negative. The injury doesn't figure to slow
down Bryant, who has become one of the strongest players in the world of
Fantasy this year.

Bob Sura , G GS - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Sura did not dress for Tuesday night's game against the Blazers. He is
battling a strained left hamstring, and is listed as day-to-day due to the
injury. Sura has averaged 8.5 points and 5.5 assists through his first 11
games. The former Florida State star does have some Fantasy value, especially
in deeper leagues, but don't expect a double-digit scoring average like the
one he posted a year ago in Cleveland.

Brad Miller , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Head Coach Tim Floyd said that Miller could return from his broken hand as
early as next Tuesday against Indiana. A more likely scenario, however, would
have Miller coming back on Dec. 21 in Orlando. Miller, who has missed 17
games thus far, was averaging 6.0 points and 5.8 rebounds per game. With the
lack of talent at center, Miller could be useful to those Fantasy owners in
deeper leagues.

Derrick Coleman , F CHA - The Rounders Updated 12/13/00
Coleman returned to practice this week and looked good during workouts,
according to Head Coach Paul Silas. "He's moving, practicing and running the
court well," said Silas. The Hornets hope to have Coleman back for their
six-game West Coast road trip beginning on Dec. 28. Coleman does have some
Fantasy value, but don't expect his numbers to equal his 1999-'00 totals
until he gets back into playing shape.

Bryce Drew , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Drew, who has been sidelined with a strained hamstring, participated in his
first full practice on Tuesday and may return to the Bulls in time for Friday
night's game against Atlanta. Drew had averaged six points in four games
before going on the injured list on Nov. 11. With a number of point guards on
the Bulls' roster, minutes are likely to be spread around, which decreases
Drew's Fantasy value significantly. He isn't worth a roster spot at this
point.

Otis Thorpe , F CHA - Free Agent Updated 12/13/00
Thorpe, who has been out the last month with a foot injury, was activated
for Wednesday's game against Sacramento. The veteran has very little Fantasy
value, especially on a very talented Charlotte frontcourt.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/13/00
After a successful return to the court on Monday night, Hill may have taken
a step back during Wednesday night's loss to the Supersonics. He left the
game with 1:39 remaining because of discomfort in his ankle, the same ankle
which has hampered him all season long. "My ankle felt good in the first
quarter, but as we got into the third and fourth quarters, it got sore," said
Hill. "It was hurting a lot and I was a liability out there for our
ballclub." His status for Orlando's game against Portland on Friday night is
uncertain. The news can't be encouraging to Fantasy owners who have Hill on
their roster, especially if he can't play effectively on a nightly basis.

Chris Mills , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
The Warriors put Mills on the injured list on Tuesday with an inflamed right
ankle. The veteran has averaged 12.0 points and 6.2 rebounds in 15 games this
season. Mills does have some Fantasy value, especially in deeper leagues, so
keep him on the bench unless you can find an adequate replacement on the
waiver wire.

Adonal Foyle , C GS - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Foyle was activated on Tuesday night in time for Golden State's game against
Portland. He had been on the injured list after having surgery to repair torn
ligaments in his right ring finger. Foyle averaged 2.9 points and 4.4
rebounds in 16 games as a starter for the Warriors. Foyle has no Fantasy
value at this point.

Chris Crawford , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Crawford was placed on the injured list Tuesday with a sprained left ankle
and a sore right big toe. He is averaging 4.5 points in 19 games, and has no
Fantasy value.

Rod Strickland , G WAS - Fear Updated 12/12/00
Strickland left practice early on Monday due to some stiffness in both of
his hamstrings. He is expected to play on Wednesday when the Wizards host
Allen Iverson and the Sixers. Strickland is averaging 14.5 points and 7.2
assists per game for Fantasy owners this season, numbers which could be a
great deal better if he wasn't stuck in Washington.

Rasheed Wallace , F POR - Tribe Called PLove Updated 12/12/00
Wallace, who missed Saturday night's game against Detroit because of a
injured right wrist, practiced on Monday with his wrist taped. He is close to
100 percent and is expected to play against Golden State on Tuesday night.
Fantasy owners who rolled the dice and played Wallace this week will be happy
that they did - Golden State's frontcourt has been decimated by injuries and
will be easy prey for Wallace.

Jerome Williams , F DET - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Williams is currently on the injured list with a sprained right ankle. He is
scheduled to have X-rays taken on the ankle on Tuesday, and won't be eligible
to return to action until Dec. 19. He is averaging 8.1 points and 8.2
rebounds per game this season, and has marginal value in the world of
Fantasy.

James Posey , F DEN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Posey and a handful of unnamed teammates may not play in Tuesday night's
game against the Heat in protest over the actions of Head Coach Dan Issel.
"The team got together and discussed some things," said Posey, "and
(protesting) is what the conclusion was (Monday)." Reports out of Denver say
that the probems between the coach and his players escolated when Issel
ripped Nuggets' center Raef LaFrentz after a recent loss to the Boston
Celtics. If the protest does in fact take place, Fantasy owners will miss a
night of production from some of their Denver players.

Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
It looks like Knight will be making a return trip to the injured list. The
Cavs' reserve point guard is still feeling some discomfort in his right knee,
and team officials are saying that he came off the injured list too soon. The
Cavaliers are expected to activate point guard Michael Hawkins in time for
their game against Dallas on Tuesday night. With Andre Miller at the point,
neither Knight nor Hawkins has any real Fantasy value.

Alan Henderson , F ATL - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Henderson was held out of workouts on Monday after spraining his left
shoulder after a hard fall during Saturday night's game against Cleveland.
Head Coach Lon Kruger said that he would wait until Tuesday to see how
Henderson felt, but the former Hoosiers' star had different ideas. "The
shoulder's still attached to my body," said Henderson. "No question I'll
play."  Henderson has been a solid performer all season, and has been one of
Atlanta's most consistent players. With trade rumors still swirling about
Dikembe Mutombo, Henderson's Fantasy value could rise even further. If he is
still available in your league, adding Henderson to your roster would be a
smart move.

Jim Jackson , G ATL - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00
Jackson is set to make his return to the court on Tuesday night as the Hawks
face off against the Kings. He has been taken off the injured list, where he
has spent the last eight games with a knee sprain. With the emergence of
Jason Terry at the two guard, Jackson will now switch back to his more
natural small forward position. Before his injury, Jackson was Atlanta's
leading scorer, averaging 17.1 points per game. The former Buckeye is worth a
roster spot if he is still available in your league, and could be a solid
replacement for those owners who just lost Eric Snow.

Tim Duncan , F SA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/12/00
Fantasy owners got a real scare when Duncan went down, clutching his knee,
during Monday's game against the Jazz. It was the same knee that Duncan had
surgery on last season. He was diagnosed with a hyperextended left knee, but
returned to the game in the fourth quarter. He will have further evaluations
performed on Tuesday. Duncan, who leads the Spurs in both scoring and
rebounding, is one of the most coveted stars in all of Fantasy.

Eric Snow , G PHI - Rude Boys (Not) Updated 12/12/00
Snow, who has been placed on the injured list by Philadelphia, will undergo
surgery on Tuesday to repair the fracture in his right ankle. He is expected
to miss 6-8 weeks.  Fantasy owners who had Snow on their roster would be wise
to check their league's free agent list in order to replace him. If no viable
alternatives are available, look to make a trade to bolster your lineup.

Isaac Austin , C VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Austin missed Monday night's game against the Rockets with the flu. He is
listed on the NBA injury report as day-to-day. At 5.1 points and 4.6 rebounds
per game, Austin has very little Fantasy value.

Michael Dickerson , G VAN - Free Agent Updated 12/12/00
Dickerson left Monday's game against the Rockets in the first quarter after
aggravating a foot injury that he sustained during training camp. Head Coach
Sidney Lowe said that Dickerson's condition will be evaluated on Tuesday.
Fantasy owners who just got Dickerson back must now hold their breath once
again and hope his latest injury isn't seroius.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/12/00
In his first game back from injury, Hill led the Magic with 19 points in a
surprising 92-80 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers. He added seven rebounds
and four assists in only 25 minutes of play. Hill shot 7-of-10 from the
field, and looked like he is almost all the way back from his ankle injury -
which should make his Fantasy owners very happy to have him back in their
lineup.

Shaquille O'Neal , C LAL - The Rounders Updated 12/11/00
O'Neal will receive his diploma at Louisiana State on Friday, causing him to
miss that night's game against the Vancouver Grizzlies at Staples Center.  He
will miss the game with his team's blessing -- and won't be docked any of his
$19.286 million season salary.  His absence shouldn't hurt you in a Fantasy
league that goess by averages but it could be a problem in leagues that go by
total points.
