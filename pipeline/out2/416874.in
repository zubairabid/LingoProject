What the NYMEX is trying to get at is their concern that the NYMEX considers
the trades of ENA and its two other principal trading affiliates (Enron
Canada and London) to be one and the same as ENA.  It is also concerned that
we might and try and set up other companies and trade of of those to try and
increase our overall trading volume with the NYMEX.  Further, the NYMEX also
doesn't want us to increase our company's overall trading volume, by "hiding"
trades through accounts in the name of individual employees,   The Annual
Hedge Exemptions applications require that ENA represent whether its
officers, employees, owners, or agents have a power of attorney, control or
have a financial interest in any other related commodity future(s) account
either individually or acting with another person pursuant to express or
implied agreement.as indicated in the original email from Mark.   The
transaction you mentioned below doesn't appear to be problematic, since it
flows through ENA's risk books,  thus not increasing the overall position the
NYMEX allows us to trade.
This annual email has a secondary unplanned, but helpful control purpose, it
fleshes out the trading of employees that might be in violation of the
Company's Trading Policy.
