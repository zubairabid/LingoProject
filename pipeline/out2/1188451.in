I wish it were more clear.  I am trying to get down there to talk to the
commercial people about the business direction and support we can provide but
until then I don't know that we should get their hopes up.  I had hoped to
come this week but Randy is here in Houston.  Maybe second half of next
week?  Do you know if everyone will be in those days? (I was thinking Sao
Paolo Wed/Thurs and B.A. Thurs/Fri).
