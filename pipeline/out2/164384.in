It's worth noting too (perhaps as part of Jeff's first or second points) that
in addition to chasing existing power supplies out of the state, price caps,
and the uncertainty surrounding them, chase new generation away.  The turbine
market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their
own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in
jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other
than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and
Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have
ordered.
