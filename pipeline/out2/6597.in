Thanks for hosting the breakfast and for emphasizing the importance of the
PRC process to the success of Enron.  Prior to joining Enron, I worked at two
other companies in the mid-stream natural gas industry.  As I was listening
to you speak about the way Enron was in the pre-PRC days (the Hay system and
the like), memories of some of my experiences in those organizations came
rushing back.  Although I had a number of important reasons for leaving those
companies, the key issue in both instances was the failure of their
performance review processes.

I share that information because I have seen both sides, the worst and now
the best.    As with most things, those who complain or criticize often do
not really understand or appreciate how good they have it.  Criticism is
often fostered by a lack of understanding - - people asking "why?" in a
destructive way.  The information you shared about the importance of the
program to Enron,s continued success and the points you made in response to
some of the criticisms of the process were both very important.  I will take
your message and pass it along, however, I respectfully encourage you to do
likewise to all of Enron.  I know you have previously stressed the importance
of the process at numerous times and through a variety of modes of
communication, but this morning you really gave the all-important reasons WHY.

I appreciate being selected to be on the committee and look forward to
participating.  Thanks also your leadership, it's truly inspiring.

Sincere regards,
Ed McMichael
