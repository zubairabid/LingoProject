Hi  Folks,

Week 10. Crunch time. In most fantasy seasons, this is the  week you can
look back upon and say &that,s when I made the move8 or &that was the win
that put me over  the edge8. Most leagues have a 14  game regular season so
we,re heading down the stretch. To that end, I,ve tried my best to ramp  it
up a notch and make these Matchup capsules a little more detailed this
week. Along with the Quick News  sent yesterday, it,s all part of that
&Delivering More Than Promised8  mentality.

New Feature -- On Target ! One of my favorite views for stats  is to see
how many times a player is the target of an intended pass. It,s a much more
telling number than  receptions when predicting future performance as it
shows the true QB  distribution tendencies. Here,s a  look at the WRs for
the first half of the 2000 season that I think you,ll find  interesting.
Lemme know what you  think http://cheatsheets.net/targets.htm

Matchups to Avoid  and Exploit.

Passing Game  Matchups. Here's how I see the matchups this  week. Please
note, see the  cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week10sheet.htm
for exactly where I rank playersand to  determine who to start. Just because
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup. The matchup info  is meant
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between
players.

Note: I,ve used the player stats sorted by  performance over the last four
weeks extensively in developing these write-ups.  Stats are provided by Mike
Hall,s excellent FLM League Management Software. http://www.fflm.com/ for
more info. Thanks to ESPN.com for the  data breakdown of Fantasy Points
Allowed by position.

Here we go:

Locks: These games heavily favor the Offense

New Orleans  Passing Game vs 49er Defense  Even with the  offensive
fireworks, the 49ers continue to lose games for one simple  reason: They can,
t stop  anyone.  QB  Jeff Blakeand crew gets to  tee off on a defense that,s
allowed an average of 286 passing yards per game  over the last four weeks
which is dead last. They make everyone look good and this  week should be no
different.  Blake,s been up and down but this should be a week he rolls. WR
Joe  Hornremains his best  WR as Keith Poole is battling a neck stinger.
Keep an eye on Horn as he suffered a  sprained knee in Sunday,s game but was
able to return. Both he and Poole practiced this week  and should be good to
go. RB Ricky  Williamsmay be his best  receiver though and should continue to
roll up great numbers. San Francisco ranks # 31 in Fantasy  Points allowed
by opposing QBs.

San Diego Passing  Game vs Seahawk Defense This week, San Diego faces a
Seattle team that,s in freefall.  The defense ranks # 30 in passing yards
allowed per game over the past  four weeks giving up 278 yards per game.  As
odd as it may seem, QB Jim  Harbaughhas been a top 10  Fantasy QB over the
past couple of weeks throwing for 4 TDs and 509 yards in two  games. The
tricky part is to figure  out who,ll catch the passes. In  week 7,  WRs
Jeff  Grahamand  Curtis  Conwayhad great games  while TE  Freddie Joneswas a
non  factor. Then in week 9 (Chargers  had a bye in week 8), it was back to
the TE as Jones hauled in 2 TDs and 111  yards on 10 receptions. I think
you,ll continue to see the distribution lean towards what we saw last week
with  Freddie Jones as the primary target.  On a side note, you have to love
Jim Harbaugh refusing to answer  questions from the reporter wearing a San
Francisco sweatshirt. Not only did he not answer the  questions, he got on
him for having the gall to &come out to the Charger complex  wearing the
enemy,s jersey8 .

Oakland Passing  Game vs Chief Defense Over the last three weeks, Kansas
City  has allowed 267 passing yards per game.  They,re suffering a little
bit from the &Rams Syndrome8 where their  explosive offense forces team to
play catch-up and throw the ball. QB Rich  Gannonremains along  with Jeff
Garcia one of the nicer &surprises8 of the 2000 season. The Raider Offense
fell asleep last  Sunday night vs San Diego but I,m betting they get back to
their normal self  against the Chiefs. No offense to  Charger fans, but it,s
easy to look past San Diego on the schedule. In their week 7 matchup, Gannon
threw  for 244 yards and 2 TDs. Tim Brownwas the only WR  to put up any
numbers to speak of in that game (5 receptions for 89 yards but no  TD) and
it,s worth noting that both RBs Tyrone Wheatley  andNapoleon  Kaufmancaught
TD passes  in the game.  James Jett  andAndre  Risonmake nice  complementary
WRs on a real NFL team but probably aren,t starters in most  Fantasy
leagues.  TE  Ricky Dudley remains one of the  most frustrating players
around. If  you,ve hung with him this long, he,s probably worth starting
just on the chance  he breaks out but he,s been a huge disappointment.

Green Bay Passing  Game vs Minnesota Defense The Minnesota defense made
Tampa  Bay,s Shaun King look great Sunday.  I,m betting they,ll have a
similar effect on Brett Favre this week. The Vikings pass defense ranks # 27
in  passing yards allowed per game over the last four weeks. They rank # 26
in Fantasy Points allowed  to opposing QBs this year. QB Brett  Favrelooked
bad  against Miami last week failing to break the 200 yard passing barrier or
score a  TD. Minnesota brings a different  quality defense than what Favre
saw last week though and he,ll likely have more  success.  WR  Bill
Schroederalmost seems like  the better Fantasy choice than supposed #1 WR
Antonio Freeman  who managed a  whopping 2 receptions for 10 yards Sunday.
Green Bay,s still using two TEs with Bubba  Franksand  Tyrone  Davis. Both
catch enough to diminish the value  of the other.  RB  Dorsey Levenscatches
the ball  well but his health remains a huge  concern.

Indianapolis  Passing Game vs Bear Defense The Bears trail only San
Francisco  when it comes to giving up Fantasy Points to opposing QBs. You
know I love Daunte Culpepper, but  Peyton  Manningwill be the best  QB they,
ve faced yet. Chicago may  be energized with Jim Miller starting at QB but
Manning should have his way with  the defense. In fact, Miller may  actually
boost Manning,s numbers as he,ll hopefully move the offense better than  the
injured Cade McNown had.  WR  Marvin Harrisonremains the clear  go to guy.
Jerome  Pathonand  Terrence  Wilkinsare distant  alternatives. Of course
Edgerrin  Jamesis a deadly  threat out of the backfield. The  TEs are tough
to call as both Ken Dilgerand  Marcus  Pollardare  effective. Pollard had a
big game  last week but he,s tough to depend on.

Kansas City  Passing Game vs Raider Defense These are two very good
football  teams that give up way too many yards through the air. Kansas City
is averaging 267 passing  yards per game allowed over the past four weeks
while the Raiders are yielding  242 yards per game over that span.  Elvis
Grbacis one of the  nicer stories of 2000 and he ought to continue his roll
in this one. Grbac threw for 288 yards and 2 TDs in  their week 7 matchup.
Derrick  Alexanderis the #1 WR and  provides great stability and
instruction.  Rookie Sylvester  Morrismissed last  week,s game and he,s up
in the air for this week. Of course, the big gun for KC is  TE Tony
Gonzalezwho had 7  receptions for 100 yards and a TD in their last meeting.



Prime Matchups:  These games favor the Offense

Carolina  Passing Game vs Ram Defense Wesley Walls or no Wesley Walls,  the
Rams still are giving up 264 passing yards per game over the last four
weeks. That lands them squarely in  the #28 slot. Again, much of this
number is driven by the fact St. Louis forces team to throw the ball but that,
s  not really important. All that,s  important is that teams do throw the
ball on the Rams. And effectively. QB Steve Beuerlein will sorely  miss
Wesley Walls. But he,ll have  to find someone to take up the slack.  Their
big physical WRs Donald Hayes and Muhsin Muhammad  were pushed around last
week by the Falcon corners and can,t let that happen  again. Look for RB
Tshimanga Biakabutuka to play an even bigger role catching the ball  with
Walls out. His knee,s looking  better and he should be able to go. The TE
situation is still muddy. Kris Mangum,s shoulder is still a  big problem.
And Brian  Kinchen is more valuable as the long snapper. Rookie Casey
Crawford could get  the start. Pay attention because  St. Louis gives up
more fantasy points to the TE than all but one other team in  the league.

Buffalo  Passing Game vs Patriot Defense Patriot LB Andy Katzenmoyer was
placed on Injured Reserve this week and that,s got to hurt. Even with him,
the Patriots had been  pretty weak in defending the pass.  Over the last
four weeks, they ranked # 24 in passing yards allowed per  game. They,re #
20 in points  allowed to opposing QBs. Doug  Flutie comes into this game
fighting for the #1 job. Coach Wade Phillips and even Flutie have  been
saying it,s Rob Johnson,s job yada yada but I feel another strong  game from
Flutie could earn him the right to keep starting. He,s impossible to sack
while Johnson  takes enough sacks in one game to make an NFL Films highlight
reel. For WRs, it,s all Eric  Moulds. He grabs a huge  percentage of the
passes which is the perfect scenario for Fantasy GMs. Jeremy McDaniel has
edged ahead  of Peerless Price, but neither are starter material in most
leagues. TE Jay Reimersma made his return  last week and that,s huge news
for both Reimersma and Flutie  owners.

Miami  Passing Game vs Lion Defense Detroit enters this game with a
defense that,s allowing 233 passing yards per game over the last four
weeks. That earns them a # 23  ranking. When ranked by number of  points
they allow opposing QBs, they rank # 24. QB Jay Fiedler has been
inconsistent making great plays followed by awful throws. He,ll have to be
ready as cornerback  Bryant Westbrook,s been on a tear of late.  WRs Oronde
Gadsden and Leslie Shepherd catch most all of  the passes. RB Lamar Smith
doesn,t catch many balls and the TEs are a non factor. Keep an eye on
Fiedler,s ribs as they  were giving him a lot of trouble before the game last
week.

Chicago  Passing Game vs Colt Defense Indianapolis continues their  version
of &St. Louis Lite8 ) Great QB / WR / RB with a porous defense. Actually,
that defense is a help as it  keeps the passing game alive instead of
allowing the offense to go into its  preferred ground game to control the
clock. Chicago,s defense ranks # 30 in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing
QBs this season while Indianapolis ranks # 28. In other words, expect a
shootout. QB Jim Miller takes over the  reins and it,ll be interesting to
see how he responds. He,s reportedly looked excellent in  practice and the
team seems energized with his presence. Cade McNown is regarded by many as
the  &golden boy8 who received preferential treatment from the staff.
Miller, is the blue collar guy and seems  to have the players behind him.
WR Marcus Robinson is of course the prime target. Remember he excelled in
1999 no matter  who threw the ball to him. Look for  Miller to lean on him.
WRs Dez  White, Macey Brooks and Eddie Kennison should all see action but
picking any WR past Robinson is tough.  Kaseem Sinceno is the TE who
replaced John Allred and he,s still  learning the system.

New England  Passing Game vs Buffalo Defense The Bills pass defense has
looked a  little shaky lately giving up an average of 231 passing yards per
game over the  last four weeks. That ranks #  22. QB Drew Bledsoe has had
a week to prepare for the Bills and it,s a game both teams desperately need
to  win. He,s played pretty well the  last couple of games but his numbers
are a little inflated with 2 rushing TDs  that you certainly can,t depend
on.  WR Terry Glenn was red hot early but has cooled a bit. Troy Brown and
Tony  Simmons have been cutting into Glenn,s production. For what it,s
worth, there,s been talk  of moving TE Eric Bjornson to WR which couldn,t
hurt his numbers  any. RBs J.R. Redmond  and Kevin Faulk are both dangerous
receivers.

Seattle  Passing Game vs Charger Defense I,m not overly excited about QB
Jon Kitna and crew, but the Charger defense has to rate as a good matchup,
even  after their improved performance against the Raiders last week. San
Diego ranks # 27 in Fantasy Points  allowed to QBs this year. Over the  last
four weeks, they,re averaging 231 passing yards per game allowed which  ranks
them # 21. Jon Kitna  gets the start as Brock Huard is still feeling the
adverse affects of a  concussion he suffered a couple of weeks ago. It
concerns me that a player this young  is taking so long to be cleared to
play.  Although he's reportedly feeling better today and may be able to go
next  week. The troubles don,t end there as RB Ricky Watters is listed as
Questionable with a bad toe. He,s a  huge help for the passing game not only
in catching the ball but in keeping the  defense honest against the run.  WR
Darrell Jackson is a promising player but it appears he,ll  yield to Derrick
Mayes who,ll get the start along with Sean  Dawkins. Mayes is reportedly
healthy for the first time in a long while. If you,re going to play them,
this would  probably be the week. TE  Christian Fauria caught a TD last week
so maybe he,s waking up. Like I said, I don,t expect too much out  of these
guys, but they do have a solid matchup.

Minnesota  Passing Game vs Packer Defense Over the past four weeks, Green
Bay,s defense has allowed 218 passing yards per game. That,s not awful, but
still puts them  well below average at # 20. They  rank # 22 in Fantasy
Points allowed to the opposing QB for the year. Daunte Culpepper is coming
off  one of his worst games against a tough Tampa Defense yet he still put up
FF  numbers worthy of a starter. This  week, he,ll have a much easier go of
it facing Green Bay. Just like most thought, Cris  Carter seems to be
catching more passes than Randy Moss while Moss is  more the home run
threat. They both  have 3 TDs over the last three games so you can,t deny
either guy. Start both without worry. RB Robert Smith will get back on
track after being held down by the Bucs which is nothing to be ashamed of.
Minnesota has yet to find a consistent  TE.



Even Matchups: These games feature no real advantage  either way

Detroit  Passing Game vs Miami Defense It,s hard to add up. Sam Madison
and Patrick Surtain are  thought to be two of the better corners in the
league. Yet they rank #26 in passing yards per  game over the last four
weeks. If  you look a little closer, you,ll see they rank #9 in Fantasy
Points allowed to  the opposing QB for the year. QB  Charlie Batch has
played about like we thought he would ) not very  good. He,s up and down
showing just  enough flashes to get folks excited.  Only to be disappointed
later.  His WRs, once thought to be a strength of depth, are now looking
very  thin. Germane Crowell is  gone. And Herman Moore is  nursing a sore
sprained foot. It  looks like Johnnie Morton is the only healthy guy he has
unless you get  excited about Brian Stablein and Larry Foster. RB James
Stewart is a fine runner  and he,s starting to become more involved as a pass
receiver. TE Davis Sloan might be a starter  in a 31 team league. But just
barely.

St. Louis  Passing Game vs Panther Defense Over the last four weeks,
Carolina has been pretty effective defending the pass. They,ve allowed 199
yards passing per  game over that stretch which is # 12.  They,ve been even
stronger in the Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  QB where they rank #
4 for the year.  This is St. Louis though.  QB Trent Green steps in with a
week under his belt. He was clearly more comfortable in the  nd half of
Sunday,s game and Mike Martz admitted he may have been a  little too
conservative with Green early even though he made pregame statements  that he
wouldn,t be. I look for  continued production from him. For  WRs, Isaac
Bruce is the #1 guy.  Green hooked up with him for 8 receptions last week.
After Bruce, it looks like Torry  Holt and Az-Zahir Hakim will catch the
balance. Both those guys are decent starters if  you,re not loaded with
WRs.  Ricky Proehl is up and down.  Sometimes a # 3 WR for a team like St.
Louis can equal the #1 WRs numbers  from a poor team. RB Marshall Faulk
continues to put on a clinic with  both his rushing and receiving skills.
Trent Green didn,t complete a pass to his  TE Sunday.

Baltimore  Passing Game vs Bengal Defense Where,d the Bengals come  from?
I,ll hand it to new coach  Dick LeBeau, he,s got these guys playing hard.
Over the past three games, their defense  has allowed 218 passing yards per
game for a ranking of # 19. The big difference is in the Bengal rush
defense. They now rank # 19 in  rushing yards allowed over the previous 4
weeks. Back in week 6, they were ranked # 30 in  rushing yards allowed over
the previous 4 games. Nice work, coach. This fired up defense faces a
Baltimore  team that,s absolutely dying to score a TD. QB Trent Dilfer gets
the start  again. True to coach Brian  Billick,s prediction, Dilfer played
with a &frenetic8 pace and did give the team  a spark at times. At times he
looked pretty bad too. Let,s see if  another week of practice with the 1st
team helps. Qadry Ismail will be the prime  target and Patrick Johnson
replaces the injured Travis Taylor. In a case of what goes around, comes
around, Taylor,s broken collarbone was the exact injury that knocked Johnson
out  earlier and allowed Taylor to start.  The guy I keep thinking will
explode is TE Shannon Sharpe. He,s clearly the best receiver on the  team
and you know this drought has to be killing him. If you saw him on ESPN at
the Halloween  party doing the Austin Powers thing (scariest costume I saw
this year) you heard  him say he was hoping no one recognized him as a Raven
Offensive player. He predicted it would be an &open the  floodgates8 type of
thing once the TDs started coming.

Denver  Passing Game vs Jets Defense The Jets are playing  decent defense
of late allowing an average of 206 passing yards per game over  the last four
weeks which nets them a ranking of # 14. They rank # 11 in Fantasy Points
Allowed  to the QB for the year. After a bye  week, Denver comes into this
game hoping for a fresh start after chewing on the  humiliating loss to
Cincinnati for two weeks. Much has been made of Brian  Greise,s drinking and
driving troubles but I doubt that,ll affect his game  play Sunday. He ranks
as the # 2 QB  in the league over the last three weeks in Fantasy Points per
Game. In those two games, he,s thrown for an  amazing 701 yards and 5 TDs.
Start  him. As usual, both Rod  Smith and Ed McCaffrey are solid plays. The
trouble comes in picking a TE as  Denver has not one, not two, but three that
contribute. Desmond Clark,  Dwayne Carswell and Byron Chamberlain all see
action. From a Fantasy Football  perspective, Denver would be much  better
off with just one TE catching all the TE passes but I,ve noticed the real
NFL guys pay very little attention to our desires. The big news for this
game will be  the comeback of Terrell Davis.  Few players get to make two
comebacks in one season but Davis will give  it a go.

New York Jets  Passing Game vs Denver Defense Vinny Testeverde and the Jets
are  one of the toughest teams to predict.  They just seem to throw a curve
more often than not, either surpassing or  falling short of expectations.
With  that said, they face a perplexing Denver defense that ranks # 3 in
passing yards  allowed over the last 4 weeks. Yet  they only rank # 15 in
Fantasy Points Allowed by the Opposing QB for the  year. Vinny
Testeverdecomes off a solid  outing last week where he completed 28 of 38
passes for 293 yards and 2  TDs. He seems to finally be getting
comfortable. His WR tandem of  Wayne  Chrebetand  Laveranues  Colesis very
solid. Coles had a great game last  week catching 5 passes for 131 yards.
Chrebet,s a sure starter and I,d probably roll the dice on Coles as  well.
Jermaine Wiggins and Fred  Baxter have both scored from the TE position in
recent weeks but you can,t count  on them. I have learned this about WRs )
Don,t trust anything  Keyshawn Johnson says about fellow WRs.  When Jeff
Graham went San Diego, Keyshawn told my friend Steve Cohen who  covered the
Jets for WFAN in NYC that Graham would be a top 10 WR in the  AFC. And then
this year all we  heard from Johnson was how Dedric Ward was the #1 WR in New
York. Just so you  know(

Tampa Bay  Passing Game vs Falcon Defense Atlanta ranks # 16 in passing
yards allowed per game over the last four weeks yet for the year, they rank #
7  in Fantasy Points allowed to QBs.  Let,s see if QB Shaun King can
continue the roll. Week 9 was a pivotal week for this  offense as following
a four hour talk to Keyshawn Johnson at King,s  house, the Tampa QB seemed
recharged.  Specifically, he seemed recharged in getting the ball to
Johnson. That,s a shocker Johnson would want the  ball. I worked the
sidelines of a  Jets game for WFAN radio and my buddy Steve Cohen a couple of
years ago and have  a different view of Keyshawn than many do.  Yes, he
wants the ball. But  I think he wants it not so much for personal glory as
he wants it because he  knows how good he is and truly believes the team has
its best chance to win when  they go to him. Either way, it  seems pretty
obvious King will continue with what worked last week. He,s beginning to
force the ball to  Johnson even in double coverage.  Jacquez Green could
benefit from the extra attention paid to  Keyshawn but be careful to watch
how the ball is spread around. RB Warrick Dunn only had one  reception last
week but it was good for a TD. I,d look for more of that.



Downside Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Washington Passing Game vs Cardinal  Defense:

(Note: For you folks who are not subscribers to  the FREE Cheatsheets.net
mailing list, I wanted to give you a sample of the type  of information we
regularly send out.  This was sent to our subscribers at 5:45 PM Thursday
afternoon.)

Confirming what we thought  this morning when we ranked Jeff George and not
Brad Johnson on our week 10  cheatsheet
http://www.cheatsheets.net/week10sheet.htm

Brad Johnson Out, Jeff  George to
Starthttp://espn.go.com/nfl/news/2000/1101/851321.html From the article:
Jeff George was  named the Washington Redskins' starting quarterback for
Sunday's game at  Arizona.

Coach Norv Turner said George would  start after Brad  Johnson was unable to
practice Thursday for a second consecutive day.  Johnson sprained a knee
ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. George  missed Wednesday's
practice to attend the birth of his son, his third child.

George signed a four-year, $18.25  million contract in April to back up
Johnson. He has yet to play a down this  season and has taken only about 10
percent of the snaps in practice.

"He had a very good practice today,"  Turner said. "He's into it, in terms
of what we're doing." The Redskins have a bye after the Arizona  game, but
officials are uncertain whether Johnson will be able to return for the
following game, a Monday night trip to St. Louis.

"He's got a pretty tender knee,"  trainer Bubba Tyer said. "Grade 2 sprains
could be two weeks, could be four  weeks." Further complicating the
Redskins' offensive preparation for this week, three receivers are suffering
from injuries, with Irving Fryar the  most serious. Fryar, who missed
practice Wednesday because of a rib-cartilage  injury, returned Thursday but
is questionable for Sunday.

Albert Connell  practiced despite a sore right shoulder and is probable. And
James Thrash also  practiced despite a strained thigh muscle and is probable.


My View: I,m sure Jeff George isn,t available in  your league but if he,s on
your roster, now might be the time to consider  him. I,m not overly excited
though  as Arizona has a pretty tough pass defense. Over the last four
weeks, they rank # 5  in passing yards allowed per game.  For the season,
they rank # 13 in Fantasy Points Allowed by the Opposing  QB so they,re not
quite as tough there.  This could likely be an  audition for 2001 as many
feel George is the Redskin QB of the future. A strong performance could
easily cause  problems for the remainder of this year as Washington tries to
sort out the QB  position. WRs Albert Connell and  James Thrash are both
listed as probable and should be good to go. At this point  in the year,
nobody is 100%. RB  Larry Centers does such a nice job catching the ball out
of the backfield that  TE Stephen Alexander has been ineffective.



Atlanta Passing Game vs Buccaneer Defense Tampa Bay gave up 300+ yards to
Daunte Culpepper  last week and 1 TD. That,s pretty  solid. They rank # 13
in passing  yards allowed over the last four weeks and # 22 when sorted by
Fantasy Points  Allowed by opposing QB for the year.  QB Chris Chandler
played poorly last week but his mind  was certainly on his Father in Law,
John Brodie who is recovering from a  stroke. I look at it this way )
Minnesota brings a much more dangerous passing game than do the Falcons and
if  Tampa could hold them in check, they,ll likely do the same with Atlanta.
WR Terance Mathis is  the primary receiver with Tim Dwight making the
occasional home  run appearance. Shawn  Jefferson, after a solid start to
the season, has really tailed  off. Reggie Kelly  is only an average TE.



Dallas  Passing Game vs Eagle Defense This summer, Dallas featured  more
optimism in their training camp than just about any other franchise. What a
difference 9 weeks can make. Joey Galloway,s gone and Troy  Aikman looks
like a shadow of his former self. With Randall Cunningham at QB,  the
Cowboys square off against a Philadelphia team that ranks # 6 in Fantasy
Points Allowed by opposing QBs for the year. They rank # 18 in passing yards
allowed  over the last four weeks. Aikman sitting  this one out may not be
an altogether bad thing for the Cowboys as  Cunningham has moved the team
well at times. WRs James McKnight and Raghib  Ismail will handle the WR
duties.  TE Jackie Harris has been their most productive receiver with 5
TDs. Although don,t get too excited  about Harris as the Eagles are # 2 in
the league for Fantasy Points Allowed to  opposing TEs.

San  Francisco Passing Game vs Saints Defense  As you know, I,m a big Jeff
Garcia fan but this is a tough matchup  for the 49ers. New Orleans ranks #
10 over the last four weeks in passing yards allowed per game and they rate #
4  for the year in Fantasy Points Allowed to Opposing QBs. Couple that with
the fact New Orleans is  playing very well of late with their ball control
offense led by Ricky Williams  and it could be a tough game. Still  though,
it,s hard to dismiss a guy like Garcia who,s been just red hot for a  while
now. He,s the # 1 QB over the  last three games throwing for 8 TDs and 886
yards. You don,t hear anyone talking too much  about it because the team,s
not winning but he,s putting together a season that  statistically, would
make Steve Young envious. WR Terrell Owens is the  best WR in the game right
now. He,s  big, physical, and most importantly, incredible after the catch.
He looks like a man among boys out  there. Jerry Rice  as morphed into the
perfect # 2 guy. (yes, that still sounds strange) If you can think about
benching any of  those three guys, you,re teams so loaded you probably don,t
need any help from  me. RB Charlie Garner  is one of the league,s best RBs
and he,s tremendous catching the  ball. The only real weak link is  the TE
but that just means more opportunity for the other  guys.

New York  Giant Passing Game vs Cleveland Defense  The Cleveland Brown
defense simply doesn,t yield many yards or Fantasy  Points through the air.
The Browns  rank # 8 in passing yards allowed over the last four weeks. When
ranked by Fantasy Points allowed by  opposing QBs, the Browns rank # 3 for
the year. You could theorize that teams simply  don,t have to throw the ball
since the Brown,s rush defense is weak, and the  Cleveland offense doesn,t
score much.  The &why8 isn,t as important as the &what8. And &what8 happens
is teams don,t roll  up many passing stats against Cleveland.  QB Kerry
Collins is coming off a nice week 9 where he threw for  253 yards and 1 TD.
We  predicted WR Amani  Toomer would respond in a positive manner to his 2nd
half  benching in his previous game. I,d  call 108 yards and a TD a positive
response. Ike Hilliard is a fine WR and a  nice complement to Toomer.
There,s  been a good bit of talk that Hilliard is the better WR but I still
put my faith  in Toomer. TE Pete Mitchell  is still a huge disappointment
compare to what we thought he,d do. Against the Brown defense, I think  you,
ll see heavy doses of  RBs Ron Dayne and Tiki Barber which should limit the
Giant passing game.

Philadelphia  Passing Game vs Dallas Defense Dallas is struggling
offensively  but the defense is playing well.  Over the last four weeks,
they rank # 6 in passing yards allowed per  game. For the year, they,re
not as strong in the Fantasy Points Allowed by QB department where they rank
#16. QB Donovan  McNabbis coming off a  poor game last week where he only
completed 10 of 31 passes for 129 yards and 1  TD. But the Cowboys are
coming off  a game where they allowed the struggling Jaguars to throw for 3
TDs. Still I think the matchup favors the  defense here.  Charles
Johnsonand  Torrance  Smallare the WRs with  Johnson being the only guy worth
looking at. One worrisome note is the fact defenses  have figured out how to
shut down TE Chad  Lewiswho,d been on  fire. Coach Andy Reid says he,ll do
some things with Lewis so teams aren,t as able to bracket him. The RBs are a
total mess and can,t be  counted on for much relief in the passing game.



Defensive Slam  Dunks: These games heavily favor  the Defense

Tennessee Passing  Game vs Steeler Defense  Pittsburgh rates  as the
toughest defense in the league when it comes to Fantasy Points Allowed by
Opposing QBs. Not good news for  Steve McNair who,s struggling against
average defenses, much  less one as tough as Pittsburgh.  They also rank # 1
in passing yards allowed per game over the last four  weeks. If McNair is a
guy you  normally consider for your QB, I,d look elsewhere if you,ve got
another solid  starter. The Titan WRs are a  mess. Yancey Thigpen is
likely  out. If you haven,t cut him by now,  you,re not paying close
attention.  Derrick Mason and Chris Sanders are the  likely starters with
Carl Pickens thrown in the mix. Outside of Mason, I,d have a hard time
starting any of these guys. The one  receiver I have no hesitation going
with is TE Frank  Wycheck. He,s as solid as  ever and is having a great
season with 4 TDs so far. He,s clearly the favored target for  McNair.
Here,s a small bright  spot. Pittsburgh ranks #1 in  Fantasy Points Allowed
for QBs.  They rank # 3 in Fantasy Points Allowed to WRs but against TEs,
they,re  just average, ranking # 16. What  does this mean? It means Wycheck
is  your best bet for Titan receiver this  week.

Cincinnati Passing  Game vs Raven Defense I can,t remember a team in
recent  history with such a disparity between the offense and defense. The
Raven offensive woes are well  documented as they went 0 for October in the
TD department. At the same time, the defense is  squashing people. This
week could  be ugly as they take out some frustration on the Bengal passing
game. Baltimore is ranked # 2 over the last  four weeks in passing yards
allowed per game. They also rank # 2 in Fantasy Points  Allowed by Opposing
QBs.  QB  Akili Smithhas a tough time  moving the ball against the practice
squad guys. I doubt he,ll suddenly become a  good QB this Sunday. WR
Peter  Warrickis the primary WR  but he,s been stifled. He,s worth a  shot
if you,re desperate just because he,s a guy who can make something happen
whenever he touches the ball but I don,t like the matchup for the passing
game. TE Tony  McGeeis a total non  factor. This unit is all about  Corey
Dillon running the  ball.

Cleveland Passing  Game vs Giant DefenseIt,s a case of an awful offense
meeting up against a pretty good defense.  Over the last four weeks, the
Giants rank # 9 in passing yards allowed  per game. Those stats should be
padded a bit after facing the dynamic passing duo of  Doug  Pederson and
Spergon  Wynn. I actually like some of the things I,ve  seen Wynn do but he,
s got a long way to go. WRs Kevin  Johnson,  DennisNorthcuttand  David
Pattenwill catch what  passes there are to be caught but with the exception
of possibly Johnson, you,re  reaching there.  TE  Aaron Sheais not a
factor.

Arizona Passing  Game vs Redskin Defense I,ve ripped  Jake  Plummer nearly
every week  this season and I,m not stopping now.  He,s just not very good.
We  all got excited (including yours truly) after his scorching hot 2nd  half
of 1998. 2nd half  statistics are often a great indicator of the year to
come. Any of you who drafted Plummer last year  likely have a differing
opinion of how effective 2nd half stats are  in predicting future
performance( I  heard lots of folks say that the 1999 season was a fluke and
he,s really better  than that. I think it,s time we  faced the music and
admit his 1998 2nd half was the fluke and what  we,re seeing now is pretty
much it.  David  Bostonand  Frank  Sanderswill handle the  WR duties but
against a tough Washington pass defense, I,m not excited about  their
chances. Washington ranks # 4  in passing yards allowed per game over the
last four weeks and they earn an # 7  ranking in Fantasy Points Allowed to
Opposing QBs. RB Thomas  Joneswill likely see  plenty of action with Michael
Pittman,sribs hurting and  he does catch the ball well. On a positive note,
TE Terry  Hardyhad a great game  Sunday with 7 receptions for 45 yards and a
TD.

Pittsburgh Passing  Game vs Titan Defense Tennessee enters this game
playing  as well as any team in the league.  Much of their success can be
attributed to their defense. Over the last four weeks, they rank # 7  in
passing yards allowed per game.  Since the beginning of the season, they
rank # 8 in Fantasy Points  Allowed by opposing QBs. That,s a  pretty
formidable defense for a QB like Kordell  Stewartto face. Some feel Stewart
plays better on the  road but I,ve been to Adelphia Coliseum and I don,t
think any QB plays better on  the road there. He,ll be throwing  the ball to
Hines Ward, Bobby  Shawand  Plaxico  Burressbut I don,t see  any of those
guys as starters unless you,re in a huge league. The Steelers will likely
try to do what  they do best ) pound Jerome  Bettisso I don,t expect  to see
them pass too often and when they do, I don,t expect them to have much
success.







Rushing Game Matchups  Here's how I see  the matchups this week. Please
note, see the cheatsheet online http://www.cheatsheets.net/week10sheet.htm
for exactly where I rank players and to determine who to start. Just because
one matchup may be more  favorable than another, that doesn't necessarily
mean I'd start the player with  the best matchup. The matchup info  is meant
to be just one more tool in your box when it comes to deciding between
players.





Locks: These games heavily favor the Offense

Stephen Davis  (Was) vs Cardinal Defense  Much will be made  of Jeff George
getting his first start as a Redskin. As I mentioned above in the passing
matchups, I,m not all that excited as the Cardinals play pretty good pass
defense. More importantly, they  play horrible rush defense. Over  the last
four games, they rank # 26 in rushing yards allowed. For the year, they,ve
allowed more  Fantasy Points to RBs than any other team in the league. Look
for Jeff George to lean  heavily on Stephen Davis as he settles into the QB
role.

Ron Dayne / Tiki  Barber (NYG) vs Brown Defense Much like Arizona, the
Brown,s  feature an offense that doesn,t score too many points and a decent
pass defense  which is the result of opposing teams choosing the safer route
of running the  ball. Few coaches will pass up the  chance to run the ball
if the defense readily allows it. The Browns readily allow it. They rank #
27 in rushing yards allowed and # 25 in Fantasy Points allowed by opposing
RBs. I,d think Dayne could have a  big game here as the Giants should be
able to remain in control. Dayne struggles in the games where the  Giants
are playing from behind and I just don,t see that happening here.

Curtis Martin  (NYJ) vs Bronco Defense Nothing like a Corey Dillon 278
yard rushing day to skew the stats.  Over the last four weeks, Denver ranks
dead last in rushing yards allowed  per game with 170. In reality,  they,re
not that bad. At least I  don,t think so. I,d be willing to  bet coach Mike
Shanahan had the team work more than once on the basics of  tackling. They,
ll get a good test  against one of the best RBs in the league in Curtis
Martin. This game might actually deserve to  slide down to the Prime Matchup
category but I want to see how Denver responds  on defense.

Edgerrin James  (Ind) vs Bear Defense Chicago comes out of the bye week
and must face the explosive Colts.  After a few sputters, Edgerrin James is
running as well as any back in  the league right now. Chicago ranks  # 30 in
rushing yards allowed over the last four games. For the year, they rank # 10
in Fantasy  Points allowed to opposing RBs. MLB  Brian Urlacher should
create a few problems for James but I look for Indy to  roll here.

Ricky Williams  (NO) vs 49er Defense  Like I need to  tell you to start
Ricky Williams.  He,ll roll. San Francisco,s  rush defense is almost as bad
as their pass defense. And their pass defense is world class  bad. I think
he,s got a 200 yard  rushing day in him this year and it wouldn,t surprise me
if this is the  week. He,s got a sore right  shoulder and right knee but
practiced this week and he,s expected to  play.

Warrick Dunn /  Mike Alstott (TB) vs Falcon Defense Keyshawn Johnson said
after the  Minnesota game last week that he told QB Shaun King he needed to
get the ball to  his best players &19 and 288 &288  being of course Warrick
Dunn.  Whether this was a backhanded swipe at Alstott, I don,t know but I
do  know Dunn kicked his game up a notch Sunday rushing for 89 yards on 11
carries  and catching a 23 yard TD. Alstott  played well too gaining 56
yards on 10 carries and most importantly, no  fumbles. The Falcons rank # 25
in  rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks. For the year, they rank
# 30 in Fantasy  Points allowed by RBs.



Prime Matchups:  These games favor the Offense

Terrell Davis  (Den) vs Jets Defense He,s Baaaaaaaaaaaaaack. I may be
overly optimistic but I,m  excited about Terrell Davis, return to action.
How many players get to make two  comebacks in one year? I,m  banking on
the character of the Broncos and that they,ll bounce back with a  vengeance
after the embarrassing loss to the Bengals in their last game. TD reportedly
has looked as good as he  ever has and should be ready to lead the way. He,
ll still likely be spelled by Mike  Anderson but I think you,ll see Davis
grab the bulk of the  work.

Marshall Faulk  (StL) vs Panther Defense Coach Mike Martz called himself
&stupid8 the other day when he failed have a backup kicker active to cover
for  the injured Jeff Wilkins. That  wasn,t stupid. But you,ll be hard
pressed to define calling future Hall of Famer Reggie White &inconsistent8
and  &at the end of his career8 three days before playing him as anything
but  stupid. C,mon Coach, you,re the  defending World Champs. There,s  tape
running whenever you open your mouth.  Think first. Angry Reggie or  no,
Faulk should still have a good day.  Carolina ranks # 27 for the year in
Fantasy Points allowed to opposing  RBs. Over the last four weeks, they
rank # 20 in rushing yards allowed.

Terrell Fletcher /  Jermaine Fazande / Kenny Bynum / Robert Chancey / Natrone
Means / Deuce McAllister vs Seattle  Defense Just making sure you were
paying  attention. The Chargers could use a 1994 model Natrone Means or a
2001 Deuce  McAllister but that isn,t happening this week. It,s a shame as
the Seahawk defense is  awful. They rank # 28 in rushing  yards allowed per
game over the last four weeks and # 26 in Fantasy Points  allowed to RBs. If
you get a hunch  one of these guys may see significant time, jump on it. But
I,m guessing it,s more committee for  this game.

Stanley Pritchett  / Darnell Autry / Amp Lee vs Cowboy Defense This one is
really frustrating. The team that can,t move the ball on the  ground squares
off against the team that can,t stop anyone on the ground. Dallas is # 29 in
Fantasy Points allowed  by RBs this year. They,re also # 29  in rushing
yards allowed over the last four weeks. But who,ll carry the ball for the
Eagles  is a crapshoot. I,ll keep an eye on  it to see if one guy might
emerge but right now it,s a great matchup with no one  to take advantage of
it.



Even Matchups: These games feature no real advantage  either way

Jamal Anderson (Atl) vs Buccaneer  Defense  Jamal Anderson  seems to have
turned the corner.  He,s running hard and having good success. Last week,
he rolled up 90 yards on 25  carries. This week, he faces a  Tampa Defense
that,s probably not quite as tough as their reputation. The Bucs rank # 22
in rushing yards  allowed over the last four weeks.  They rank # 15 in
Fantasy Points allowed by RBs. QB Chris Chandler should have his mind  more
on football this week so hopefully, he,ll provide a little  help.

Sammy Morris / Shawn Bryson (Buf) vs  Patriot Defense The Patriots enter
this game with  a defense ranked # 21 in rushing yards allowed over the last
four weeks. They also rank # 18 in Fantasy Points  allowed by RBs for the
year. Both  RBs are solid, tough runners who can grind out the tough yards.
The Patriot LB corps took a hit this  week with Andy Katzenmoyer going to the
IR but they,ve got plenty of talent  there in Ted Johnson, Chris Slade and
Tedy Bruschi.

Lamar Smith (Mia) vs Detroit  Defense Smith has been one of the nicer
surprises of 2000 as he continues to run hard and productively. The Lions
rank # 12 in rushing yards  allowed over the last four weeks and # 13 in
Fantasy Points allowed be opposing  RBs for the year. Bryant Westbrook  and
the Detroit secondary are playing solid defense and it,s likely the Dolphins
will be forced to the ground.

Jamal Lewis (Bal) vs Bengal  Defense You have to hand it to new coach  Dick
LeBeau. The Bengals are  improved on defense and are playing with passion.
A few weeks ago, Cincinnati ranked # 30  in rushing yards allowed. Now  they,
re up to a very respectable # 19.  That,s a nice change. Lewis  is chomping
at the bit though. The  offensive troubles are well documented but it,s just
a matter of time before  they break loose. I,m inclined to  agree with TE
Shannon Sharpe who said he thought the TDs would come in bunches  once they
got the first couple out of the way. In their first meeting this year,
Lewis  ran for 116 yards and a TD.

Emmitt Smith (Dal) vs Eagle  Defense You can make a good case for this  one
on both sides: Emmitt Smith is  a guy who,ll carry a team when they need
help and with Aikman out, this is one  of those times. On the other hand,
the Eagles play solid run defense ranking # 18 in rushing yards allowed over
the  last four weeks. They rank # 11 in  Fantasy Points allowed by RBs.

James Allen (Chi) vs Colt  Defense James Allen continues his quest  make
the fans forget about Curtis Enis.  He,s been a decent player over the last
few weeks but needs to up the  level of his play. He,ll get a  chance to do
that against a Colt team that,s struggled at times. Over the last few weeks,
the Colt rank #  15 in rushing yards allowed. They  rank # 14 in Fantasy
Points allowed to RBs for this season. The Bears are looking for a spark
from  QB Jim Miller and they very well may get it.

Napoleon Kaufman (Oak) vs Chiefs  Defense With Tyrone Wheatley likely to
miss  significant time this week, coach Jon Gruden sounds confident in
Kaufman,s  ability to carry the load. The  Chiefs rank # 23 in Fantasy
Points allowed to RBs this year. They rank # 16 in rushing yards allowed
over the last four weeks. I  wouldn,t be surprised to see Kaufman post some
nice numbers here in Wheatley,s  absence.

Ahman Green (GB) vs Viking  Defense With Dorsey Levens nursing a bad  knee,
it looks like Green will carry the load against Minnesota. I think he,s up
for the task. Minnesota ranks # 13 in rushing yards  allowed per game over
the last four weeks while they rank # 12 in Fantasy Points  allowed by
opposing RBs. The Bucs  showed last week that Minnesota can be run (and
thrown)  on.



Downside  Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Tshimanga  Biakabutuka (Car) vs Ram Defense  I,m interested to see what
this team  looks like without TE Wesley Walls.  I,m thinking Biakabutuka
could take up some slack in the short passing  game where he,s already been
involved.  The Rams rank # 4 in rushing yards allowed over the last four
weeks but  they,re # 24 in Fantasy Points Allowed by opposing RBs for the
year. Biakabutuka was nursing a sore knee  early this week but he should be
ok to go Sunday. He,d better be as Brad Hoover is now his  backup(

Robert Smith (Min)  vs Packer Defense After a relatively quiet game
against Tampa Bay Sunday, I look for Smith to come out blazing against the
Packers. Green Bay ranks # 10 in  rushing yards allowed over the last four
weeks. They also rank # 10 in Fantasy Points  allowed by opposing RBs.
Smith has  the speed to exploit parts of the Packer Defense and I think you,
ll see him have  some success.

Kimble Anders /  Frank Moreau / Tony Richardson vs Raider Defense Too many
RBs against a tough  Defense doesn,t spell FF success.  The Raiders are
pretty tough defending the run ranking # 5 in rushing  yards allowed over the
last four weeks.  Of the bunch, I,d put my money on Anders if I had to
choose just one.

Shaun Alexander /  Ricky Watters vs Charger Defense Ricky Watters, iron man
status  could be in jeopardy as he,s in danger of missing time with a bad
case of turf  toe. Rookie Shaun Alexander may get  the start although
Holmgren could give it to Watters to keep the streak  alive. I don,t look
for great  things from either guy as the Charger run defense is solid. They
rank # 6 in rushing yards allowed  over the last four weeks and # 19 in
Fantasy Points allowed by RBs for the  year.

James Stewart  (Det) vs Dolphin Defense James Stewart is starting to get
himself untracked but he may hit an obstacle against Miami this week. Even
without MLB Zach Thomas, the  Dolphins are tough and will make things plenty
rough on Stewart. Miami ranks # 7 in rushing yards  allowed over the last
four weeks.  They rank # 9 in Fantasy Points allowed by opposing RBs for
the  year.

Corey Dillon (Cin)  vs Raven Defense The Ravens rank # 8 in the league  in
rushing yards allowed over the last four weeks. They rank # 4 for Fantasy
Points allowed  by RBs. Corey Dillon comes into  this game with 415 yards
rushing over his last two games. Something,s got to give. I,m betting it,s
going to be  Dillon. But that,s why they play  the game. In their week 4
matchup,  Dillon gained a whopping 9 yards on 12  carries.

Thomas Jones /  Michael Pittman (Arz) vs Redskin Defense Pittman,s nursing
sore ribs and  could be limited Sunday. Jones will  start if Pittman can,t
go.  Washington ranks # 9 in rushing yards allowed over the last four
weeks. The Redskins are even  tougher when sorted by Fantasy Points allowed
by opposing RBs where they come in  # 6 for the year. Looks like the
Cardinal rushing game could be in trouble.



Defensive Slam Dunks: These games heavily favor the  Defense

Travis  Prentice (Cle) vs Giants Defense  Travis Prentice sure seems like
he,s running hard without a lot to show  for it. I don,t think his luck,s
going to change this weekend as he faces a tough Giant Defense. New York
ranks #1 in rushing yards  allowed per game over the last four weeks and # 3
in Fantasy Points allowed by  opposing RBs for the year. They,re  playing
too well right now to let Cleveland hang with  them.

Charlie  Garner (SF) vs Saints Defense If you,re a regular reader of this
column, you know I,m a big Charlie Garner fan. But this matchup is awful.
The Saints are shutting people  down. They rank # 3 in rushing  yards
allowed over the last four weeks and # 2 in Fantasy Points allowed by RBs
for the year. You,ve got to slide  Garner down the list a bit against these
guys. He,s still a starter and with his  explosiveness, he,s still liable to
have a great day, but the matchup is tough  this week.

J.R. Redmond  / Kevin Faulk (NE) vs Bills Defense  Redmond should get the
start and work primarily on 1st and  nd down. Faulk will  likely be the
third down back. It  may not matter a whole lot as the Bills Defense is
solid. Buffalo ranks # 3 in rushing yards  allowed over the last four
games.  They rank # 5 in Fantasy Points allowed by opposing RBs for the
year.

Eddie George  (Ten) vs Steeler Defense Assuming he gets over his toe and
ankle injuries, Eddie George is a sure starter unless you,re just loaded at
RB. But, I do not like this  matchup. Pittsburgh ranks #1 in  Fantasy
Points allowed by RBs. In  their week 4 matchup, George was held to 76 total
yards which was the lowest  complete game total for the season thus far.
Pittsburgh,s defense is playing with  confidence and they,ll likely be a
factor in holding George down from his normal  lofty totals.

Jerome  Bettis (Pit) vs Titan Defense The last time Tennessee faced a
pounding power back like Bettis was Ron Dayne in week 5. Dayne had 3 rushes
for )1 yards in that  contest. Tennessee ranks # 14  in rushing yards
allowed over the last four weeks. They fall in at # 7 in Fantasy Points
allowed by opposing RBs. The  Steelers have few other weapons outside of
Bettis so look for them to give it a  go. Bettis did rush for 77 yards  and
a TD in their week 4 matchup.
