Mark and I were discussing my potential purchase of a car, and were looking
at some web sites, and thought we would pass on the following car buying web
sites:

www.edmunds.com (tells you what prices to pay for cars, safety records)

www.consumer.org (Consumer Reports Magazine Web Site, more to car safety,
repair records)

www.carclub.com (if you go to "research advice", then click on "crash test
results" they have some info on SUV crash tests.  Since y'all don't have as
many SUV's on the road in England you may not know that some of them have
failed the crash tests big time, and that also because their point of gravity
is up higher they tend to rollover (or "tump" as we say here in Texas) when
you make a sharp turn (like to avoid an accident).

Anyway, we were a little concerned about your safety...
