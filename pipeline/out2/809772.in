Just got word from EES, they can take the EOG gas.  Marde will show me a
number after I find out if CES wants this or not.  Marde also said the seller
pays a flat $100.00 to transfer gas out of their pool to EES's pool.  Marde
said the nom for June would be done as an imbalance transfer and she paid IF
+$.09 for gas this month.

EES cannot take any Peoples gas.  Should I have Scott Hendrickson try to sell
it to Peoples?  I'm also going to leave a message for Paul at Clinton.  Marde
is going to check around.
