Latest NBA Player News

Donyell Marshall , F UTA - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Marshall is suffering from a knee injury and is questionable for Tuesday's
game against the Raptors.  David Benoit will get extended playing time if
Marshall is unable to play.

Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00
Baker sat out Sunday's game against the Warriors due to a knee injury.
Jelani McCoy and Rashard Lewis got extended playing time in his absence.
Look for that to continue until Baker returns.  For now he is listed as
questionable for Wednesday's game vs. Detroit.

Arvydas Sabonis , C POR - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Sabonis missed Sunday's game at Phoenix due to a sore knee.  He has now
missed three games in a row and is questionable for Wednesday's game at
Toronto.  When Sabonis finally returns look for him to come off the bench for
a few games before returning to his job as the starting center.  Dale Davis
will start at the pivot until then.

Hubert Davis , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Davis missed his third straight game Sunday due to a strained groin.
Courtney Alexander replaced him at shooting guard.  Davis is questionable for
Tuesday's game at Houston.  When he finally does return to the lineup he may
find that Greg Buckner or Michael Finley has replaced him at the two-spot.

Steve Nash , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Nash sat out Sunday's game against the Lakers because of a bruised calf.
The Mavericks went with a backcourt of Howard Eisley and rookie Courtney
Alexander in his absence.  Nash is questionable for Tuesday's game at
Houston.

Greg Buckner , G DAL - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Buckner played for the Mavericks Sunday after missing seven straight games
prior to that with a sprained foot.   It will take him a while but Buckner
will become a productive Fantasy player again in a few weeks, if he is still
healthy.

Chris Mullin , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Mullin is still suffering from a sore knee and missed his fifth consecutive
game Sunday.  If you have Mullin on your team hoping for a miracle Fantasy
season, it's time to let go.  It appears that Mullin won't be well enough to
help a Fantasy team this season.

Chris Porter , F GS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
With Chris Mullin and Chris Mills sidelined, Porter got the first start of
his career Sunday, playing small forward.  He responded by scoring 18 points
and grabbing six rebounds.  Look out for Porter.  He is extremely athletic
and could develop into a surprise Fantasy star in the upcoming weeks.

Vince Carter , G TOR - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00
Carter is listed as day-to-day with a sore left knee, but will accompany the
team on its three-game road trip. Head Coach Lenny Wilkens said that Carter's
availability for the trip won't be determined until Tuesday. It may be a good
idea to sit Carter this week until his return date is a bit more clear.

Grant Hill , F ORL - The Wave Updated 12/04/00
The Orlando Sentinel is reporting that Hill is expected to practice with the
team on Monday and may be available to play against the Celtics on Tuesday
night.  If Hill's injured ankle is still tender, however, he will likely wait
until Orlando's West Coast road trip next week before returning. Fantasy
owners who have been waiting for Hill's return should keep him on the bench
until he has been cleared to play by the team.

Kendall Gill , G NJ - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Gill, who is currently stuck in a horrendous shooting slump, may find
himself either on the bench or being placed on the injured list. Gill has
been bothered by tendinitis in his right knee, which has made him feel like
he is "playing on one leg."  Fantasy owners who were expecting Gill to be
productive should seriously consider benching him until he is healthy enough
to perform at a higher level.

Fred Hoiberg , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Hoiberg is less optimistic that he will be able to play against the
Timberwolves on Tuesday after testing his sore left ankle in a workout on
Saturday.  He is listed as day to day, and hopes to return for Chicago's
weekend road trip through Texas. Hoiberg, like many of his Chicago teammates,
holds very little Fantasy value.

Elton Brand , F CHI - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00
Brand missed practice on Sunday after sustaining a left knee hyperextension
at the end of Friday night's loss to the Knicks. He will have an MRI
performed on Monday and is listed as questionable for Tuesday's game against
Minnesota. Brand leads the Bulls in scoring (18.8 ppg) and rebounding (10.4
rpg), and is one of the top forwards in the world of Fantasy.  Owners may
want to put Brand on their bench this week until the extent of his injury has
been determined.

Chris Herren , G BOS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
Herren has been placed on the injured list because of his sore shoulder, but
remains optimistic that he can return soon. "I'm going to rest it a bit and
see how it goes," said Herren. If the injury persists, surgery may be his
next option. Herren isn't a very value Fantasy player, so his injury won't
effect most owners.

Mitch Richmond , G WAS - Denvers Nuggets Updated 12/04/00
Richmond injured his right knee in Saturday's game against Miami, and didn't
make the trip to Detroit for Sunday's game with the Pistons. He will have an
MRI done on Monday to determine the extent of the injury.  If you have
Richmond on your Fantasy roster, it may be a good idea to keep him on the
bench this week.

Obinna Ekezie , F WAS - Free Agent Updated 12/04/00
The Washington Wizards, who traded Ekezie to the Clippers last week, have
picked him up off of waivers. Ekezie, who was released by the Clippers
shortly after the trade, had averaged 1.2 points and 1.4 rebounds in his
first stint with Washington.  He holds no Fantasy value.

Glenn Robinson , F MIL - The Old School Fools Updated 12/04/00
Robinson, one of three starters who began the game on the bench for missing
a pregame meeting, scored 24 points as Milwaukee beat the Indiana Pacers
92-80 Sunday. Bucks coach George Karl kept Robinson, fellow forward Jason
Caffey and point guard Sam Cassell out of the starting lineup one day after
criticizing his team for its dismal play in a loss at Atlanta.   Cassell,
Robinson and Caffey were replaced by Lindsey Hunter, Tim Thomas and Jerome
Kersey, respectively.   When Robinson entered the game after watching the
first eight minutes, he missed his first five shots before finding his
touch.

Charles Oakley , F TOR - Free Agent Updated 12/03/00
Oakley was suspended for three games without pay and fined $15,000 by the
NBA on Friday for punching Los Angeles Clippers guard Jeff McInnis during the
morning shootaround.   He sat out Friday night's game against the Clippers,
and also will miss games in Utah on Tuesday and Portland on Wednesday.

Scott Williams , F MIL - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00
The Milwaukee Bucks activated Williams from the injured list. Williams went
on the injured list November 17 with lower back spasms. He had been starting
at center until his injury but came off the bench Saturday, grabbing four
rebounds in six scoreless minutes of a 101-94 loss to the Atlanta Hawks. To
make room for Williams, the Bucks placed rookie guard Michael Redd on the
injured list.

Jake Voskuhl , C CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00
The Chicago Bulls activated Voskuhl on Friday and placed rookie guard A.J.
Guyton on the injured list with a sprained right knee.

Tom Hammonds , F MIN - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00
The Minnesota Timberwolves activated Hammonds from the injured list.
Hammonds had been sidelined for the entire season with soreness in both
ankles. To make room for Hammonds, the Timberwolves placed forward Reggie
Slater on the injured list with tendinitis in his right knee.

Todd MacCulloch , C PHI - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00
MacCulloch was activated Friday by the Philadelphia 76ers and Pepe Sanchez
was placed on the injured list with bursitis in the left hip.   MacCulloch
was placed on the injured list Nov. 20 with tendinitis in his left ankle.

Brevin Knight , G CLE - Free Agent Updated 12/02/00
The Cleveland Cavaliers activated Knight from the injured list Friday. The
point guard had knee surgery Aug. 17. Cleveland also placed guard Michael
Hawkins on the injured list because of a sprained left ankle.

Bonzi Wells , G POR - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00
Wells was suspended for Thursday night's game against Dallas and fined
$10,000 by the NBA for intentionally striking and verbally abusing an
official.   He will be back in the lineup for Saturday's game at Houston.

A.J. Guyton , G CHI - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00
Guyton sprained his right knee during the first quarter of Thursday night's
game against Chicago. He will undergo an MRI on Friday, and will likely miss
a few games due to the injury. Guyton is of no value in the world of Fantasy.


Emanual Davis , G SEA - Free Agent Updated 12/01/00
Interim head coach Nate McMillan has inserted Davis into the starting lineup
at guard in place of Ruben Patterson.  This move was made more to improve the
ballhandling and defense in the backcourt than for offense.  Davis will take
some of the pressure off Gary Payton in running the plays but he won't be of
much help to Fantasy teams.

Vin Baker , F SEA - The Old School Fools Updated 12/01/00
New coach Nate McMillan has made numerous roster changes since taking over
as interim head coach one of them has involved Baker.  McMillan has replaced
Baker in the starting lineup with F/C Jelani McCoy.  The move could help to
motivate Baker in the long run.  He seemed fired up against the Lakers
Thursday scoring 20 points and grabbing nine rebounds.  But Baker must still
prove that he can be a consistent producer, put him on your bench until his
Fantasy production becomes more solid.

Tyronn Lue , G LAL - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00
The Lakers are considering offers for Lue.  He is currently on injured
reserve but the Sixers and the Magic have shown interest in him.  Lue could
develop into a somewhat valuable Fantasy player on either team where he would
receive extended minutes as a backup.

Quentin Richardson , G LAC - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00
With Tyrone Nesby traded to Washington.  Richardson moved into the starting
lineup at shooting guard Wednesday.  He scored 18 points and grabbed eight
rebounds.  Keep an eye on Richardson.  If he continues to perform like this
he will be a nice Fantasy acquisition.

Samaki Walker , F SA - Free Agent Updated 11/30/00
Walker has been placed on the injured list due to a sprained left ankle. The
ankle could affect Walker's numbers for awhile when he finally does return.
Although he has been somewhat productive, Walker comes off the bench and is
only valuable in deeper Fantasy leagues.
