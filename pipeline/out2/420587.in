That fact that you asked "who?" begs the further question of what exactly you
were up to in Houston.  Have the Brits ever really won a battle any way?
(Their failure to beat a bunch of colonized farmers with pitch forks has
resulted directly in this Florida mess, and their failure to put away the
French (of all people) has resulted directly in me and the vast majority of
my fellow Canadians being subjected to official and legally mandated
bilingualism).
To the point, I believe San Felipe is the battle field adjacent to the
Westheimer battle field, where the Brits (or at least one of them) were
purportedly waging a more efficient war, until being caught red handed on the
battle fields of San Felipe, where, all the while, the Canadian forces (or at
least one of them) were so successfully conquering the enemy.
