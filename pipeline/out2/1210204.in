Mark:

David Berberian and I have been exploring opportunities with
PaperExchange.com.  As you can see from the attached note sent this morning,
we are now discontinuing discussions with this company and won't be doing a
deal with this group in the foreseeable future.

Please let me know if I need to communicate with them any more clearly to
indicate our lack of interest.  As you may recall, their investment bankers
had called David, and David had not taken their call in order to make sure we
didn't violate our NDA.

Best regards,

Mike Haney
Director, ENW Origination
