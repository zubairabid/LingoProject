I just spoke with Steve Doss and explained how to get a power marketer
certificate at FERC (and EWG filing if necessary depending on who West Linn's
partner is for plant ownership) and the 60 day (generally) time required
(Although I think that FERC would be inclined to wave the 60 days based on
the supply shortage in the West).  I also explained that EPMI is making a
filing this week at FERC that would allow EPMI to provide some FERC filing
services on behalf of industrial customers in order to facilitate their sales
to the grid (when approved, hopefully in about 60 days).  He said that West
Linn has not built the 2 cogens yet (43 MWs each of which West Linn would use
appr. 17 MWs/hour), but that it is interested in setting up its licenses
before the start of retail access on 10/1/01 in Oregon.  (An item to think
about--I don't know anything about the Oregon retail program or current rate
structure with PGE, but generally the lack of retail open access will not
prevent an industrial on site generator from selling to the grid, unless its
host utility rate schedule precludes it from doing so).

I am sending him a FERC order issued last year dealing with industrials
selling to the grid (InPower order), plus will send him the EPMI filing when
we make it later this week.
