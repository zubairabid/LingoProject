Ben, I have a reference document called Gas Turbine World Handbook in which I
look up these type of answers as well for ballpark info. They are the
"preliminary answer" to your question and should be treated as so. Please
keep in mind that these are numbers from a magazine, not from our internal
Performance/Cycles group under Gary Bush (within EECC). They are the dept
that the Dev Engineer typically consults with to arrive at a project's
capacity and efficiency, both from a new & clean standpoint and an average
degradation standpoint. The depts within EECC/NEPCO also come up with the
total installed costs. It is their numbers that are the ones that we
typically bid in a proforma, as such, they are a part of the deal approval
process (DASH). Their buy in is important because in addition to the numbers
that OEM's provide us, they factor in experience, judgement, unique project
characteristics, design basis, intake/exhaust losses, etc. They also look at
the net power for the Plant, not just the equipment itself. Having caveat'ed
these numbers, I would respond to your questions below as follows:

1. PG7241FA Capacity: 171,700 kW each @ generator terminals (ISO conditions,
gas fired @ baseload) -- does not include auxiliaries usage, duct losses
2. 1,060 MW Net Plant @ ISO, gas fired
3. 6,040 Btu/kWh LHV @ ISO, gas fired
4. Plug figure for GTG may be $32,500,000 each. No idea on the ST, swag at
$175/kW. Power island turnkey for 2x1 may be $375/kW (does not include alot
of stuff such as add'l options, development costs, tie-ins, permitting,
spares, etc, etc, etc)

Hope this is useful to you somehow, but please go to the source (described
above) for anything that we are going to hang our hat on.
