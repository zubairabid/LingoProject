Richard:
My view is that TVA will likely use the FERC ruling to attempt to
retroactively bless their treatment of the Enron control areas last summer.
Although my understanding is that Entergy used a different method than that
employed by TVA to restrict the use of a no-load control area, TVA will
argue that the result is the same and that NERC has, thus, approved
differing treatment for load and no-load control areas.  The FERC ruling
will likely create a greater sense of unease on the part of the judge to
enforce the rules of NERC, a voluntary association, in the face of what
appears at first blush to be a contrary position taken by FERC, a federal
agency.

P.S. T.O. Helton has suggested that he sit in on the upcoming depositions of
Richard Shen and the 30(b)(6) rep. on TVA's alleged damages to get a better
feel for the case.  Please let me know your thoughts on this.
