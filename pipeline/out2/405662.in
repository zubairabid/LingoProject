Is it really so you can look at girls or so people can look at you?

I think your right about everyone being able to beat anyone with one
important caveat.  The individuals in question must be in the same strata.  I
would not anticipate that an olympic medal winning long-distance runner could
be beat by Joe Shmoe who runs every day at Memorial Park.  Of course if one
is patient and bides their time they could probably stand a shot when the guy
gets really old and slow.

Also, are you so bold as to suggest you've never lost?  Or do you not
identify them as losses but rather the results of your own choosing?
