Thanks for the help Dan.  I didn't know if Jeff was in today or not.  I will
forward Jeff's version to you for reference purposes.   I think the best
course of action is to mark up their form with the changes we would need and
add whatever you think is necessary.  Then we'll just e-mail it back to them
for comments.  It seems to me they are trying to drag their feet, so if we
can push them a little that would be great.
