Richard Sage has asked us to change the slate of directors and officers of
this entity to U.S. people, with the exception that perhaps Richard Sage will
retain an officer title.   Will you please provide to me a list of who the
directors will be and who the officers will be and their respective titles.
My understanding is that these elections should take place effective March 5,
2001.  Please advise or if you would like to discuss please call me at
X58444.  Thanks for your assistance.  Teresa
