In response to Cheryl's note, in looking at a copy of a Confirmation Letter confirming the proposed agreement reached on March 1, 2000 to be effective April 1, 2000 through March 31, 2001, there is evergreen language.
A termination letter is being prepared to be faxed to Exxon with an original to follow for their records.
Cheryl, this GTC is different from the ones we usually see in that HPL required signatures from both parties executed by Exxon on 3/30/00 and HPL on 8/21/00.
If you have any questions, please call me at x35231.
Thanks, Kim
