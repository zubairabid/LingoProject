Some EES folks just popped into my office and asked me to pop into their
meeting, which starts at noon.  I'm not sure precisely what the meeting's
about, but Mona I noticed you've got it on your weekly schedule.  How do you
want to handle?  I'd be happy to pop in at noon for the meet and greet part,
but likely need to leave in order to work on the draft strategy---Paul wants
me to distribute whatever I've got done by COB today, which I think is a good
idea.
