look for some gifts i sent home for lori, mckenna and grandma.  they should
get there before friday.  if not let me know.  i got mckenna something from
etoys and i heard they are having some problems.  their stock dropped to
$0.28 yesterday from $82 last year so i don't know if they even care
anymore.  see you this weekend.
