To All:

I have attached an omnibus confirm worksheet for a transaction with this
counterparty.  We require a guaranty from their parent.  We recently
transacted with this counterparty at which time we required the same
collateral (Marie Heard worked on this).  They failed to provide the guaranty
and unwound the positions.  Now they say they will provide the guaranty. At
the time of the initial transaction they sent over thier format which Shari
Stack reviewed and commented, which I have a copy of.  I feel we should
attach a red-line version of this guaranty to the confirm for their review.

Please advise,

Russell.
