Help me...I don't understand this LME Contract.  Mark says that even though
we trade it on EOL and the trade is still done directly with us, it is still
considered an LME contract, and not a lookalike.  I think I might need to
talk to you about this tomorrow, because I'm confused.

Also, I am getting a lot of calls from the MG people in New York about
pursuing metals counterparties, and I think we need to figure out whether
they should be talking to Houston or London Legal...I'm not sure who their
lawyers should be...also, the online team here in Houston is pursuing their
business, and it's not clear to me if I should also be having them call you
about potential metals customers?

Anyway, when I get in can I give you a call?

Also, I left a voicemail for your assistant, I'm trying to track down
Edmund's address so I can send him a gift, but no response?  Do you know when
he'll be back, or how I can get in touch with him?
