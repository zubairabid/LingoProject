Susan B. should have gotten our draft of the referenced guaranty to you.  It
still needs to be reviewed by the physical gas group since we are amending
their guaranty.  Do you care about any allocation of payments between HPL and
ENA?  At the moment, I do not have any allocation language in the guaranty.
