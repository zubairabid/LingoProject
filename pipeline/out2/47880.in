It was rumoured by Reliant that there is a possibility the Devers line will
derate on Monday, Nov. 20th.  AZPS was unable to confirm this rumour and
stated that they will post the information on their web site Saturday, Nov.
18th.  We think the Devers line will be derated on Monday hrs. ending 10-16.
There has been no word about the N. Gilla line.  Because this rumour could
not be confirmed, we had to schedule as normal for that day.  For your
convenience I have supplied a list below of all the TAGS I have done for PV
Heavyload on Monday that may be effected.   Good Luck.
