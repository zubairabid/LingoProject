Jeff, have you finalized how Jenn and Craig will split out the industrial
segments? They should also come up with their business plans and a reporting
matrix similar to what you are doing with the desks.  How are you making out
at the desk level in implementing our previous discussions with Scott and the
remainder of the desks?

Regards
Delainey
