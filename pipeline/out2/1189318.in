We will soon be receiving International sports news through our deal with
Reuters.  We have also started exploring various options with Sports.com (via
CBS) about getting their content on EnronOnline.  Please make sure all the
content related discussions are held with both Dave Samuels and myself as
we'd like to avoid having patchwork solutions for the site.
Also, all content we receive via Reters will be goverened by the Agreement
we've negotiated with them (as overseen by Mark on the Houston legal team).
