Internet Tip of the Day
Tuesday November 14, 2000

Web Activism

A while back we mentioned the problem of Web porn. Several readers wrote to
ask how to get involved. Even with a World Wide Web of resources, however,
the best place to start is locally. The Web can help! You can search for
local groups, like churches, clubs, advocacy agencies, and local government
offices. Many sites will have links to other local and regional groups with
similar views and goals. There are lots of national and international groups,
too, but sometimes they aren't what their high-minded names suggest, so be
sure to check them out before you give them any of your time or money! That's
another reason to act locally -- it's easier to find out where others stand,
and your efforts may be more appreciated at the local level than the national
llevel. You can build a network of contacts over time, too -- the Web makes
it easy to stay in touch and involved.
