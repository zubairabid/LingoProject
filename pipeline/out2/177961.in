Bob,

I received approval for MRW's assistance to Enron related to regulatory risks
facing QFs.    This includes information on changes to SRAC, capacity
payments, and GMMs, as they occur both at CPUC and the legislature.  We are
also interested in industry intelligence on actions of other QFs to find
creditworthy markets for their products.   I may ask you to participate on
upcoming "update" calls, as I did twice last week.  You may also forward to
me materials that you perceive to be of material interest on this issue.

The project budget is not to exceed $1,500 including your efforts from the
last 2 weeks.  Please give me a heads up if you get near this budget amount.

Please send the invoice to my attention 121 SW Salmon St. Portland OR 97214.

Please put on the reference line:  RCR AC0S-4USV7S.

Thank you,

Alan Comnes
Enron Corp
