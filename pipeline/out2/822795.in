Daren,

A sale to Oxy Vinyls went into effect 10/01 through 10/16 for 5,000 per day.
We also delivered gas to Entex, 10,000/day for the entire month.  More gas
was pulled towards the end of the month than confirmed and I need to know if
Oxy Vinyls should get the swing for the remaining of the month even though
their deal went to zero.  Please advise.

Susan
