Yes, I thought it went well also.  We can find a way to get a long term
commitment from EOTT, thus changing their organization, without taking on the
price risk.

On the hiring, I think that is a good idea.  If it is put in a way that due
to the extensive growth that we expect to have, you want to be in the hiring
loop, I don't see how people can object.  It is not a trust situation but an
additional reference point.  We are here to help.
