Ahn-yong-ha-sae-yo Anderson team,
Looks like I'll be missing the fall recruiting activities in L.A.  I trust
all is going well, and that we should continue our success at Anderson.  I
would hope the dot com fever has died down somewhat, plus I think Enron has
quite of bit of upside to offer candidates in that so much of what we do now
is new economy without as much risk as a pure dot com.

Life in Seoul is working out quite nicely.   My wife Sunnie and I are finally
settled into our townhouse in Sungbuk-dong, next to Pukhansan National
Park.   Almost all of Korea is mountainous and we can find trails everywhere
in and around Seoul.  Work is going very well.   I'm in charge of new
business development at the SK-Enron joint venture so I've got my team
working on about half a dozen initiatives.  I am currently busy preparing for
the launch of a B2C website catering to consumers and their household
needs.   I'm also leading a pilot project to lay some fiber optic cable along
our gas pipeline network.  Summer monsoons have finally stopped, and we're
looking forward to a trip down to Pusan during Chuseok (Korean
thanksgiving).  Sunnie, daughter Heather and I spent a week in the mountains
near Seoul, quite beautiful.    Let me know how the recruiting progresses,
and also what's been going on in Houston.

Cheers,
Jung
