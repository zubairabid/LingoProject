Dear John,
Jonathan and I met with IBJ today to try and push our negotiations through to
the end.  They are still unwilling to do a CSA with us but very significantly
their back / mid office is currently looking at getting systems support in
place which would permit them to do a CSA with us in due course.  They
acknowledged to us of their own volition that the market trend is towards
CSAs even in transactions where the counter party is not a bank.  They did
say though that it would be a few months before they would be set up to do
so. Pls note that they did not agree to do a CSA with us as soon as they are
set up to do so but they now know we will come knocking at some stage to ask
them to do it so I think we have gone as far as we can on this for now.
We will therefore move forward on the credit matrix in the meantime, if you
are still willing to do so.  The bank has a credit rating of A, so I guess
this means US$15 million credit limit.
On the assumption that it is possible to draft these terms into a contract
without a full CSA, I wonder who is best to do this drafting.  I should be
able to do the negotiations but I am not sure that I am able to do the
drafting .... Alan, do you have any suggestions?
Most of the other issues are sorted now but they still want to change the
"Threshold Amount" definition to US$10 million.  Is there any flexibility on
this?
Thanks.
