As the Global Technology group moves forward in accomplishing its goals of
developing worldwide technology standards, eCommerce opportunities and global
platforms, we continue to make changes in the organization to enhance
communication and maximize our intellectual capital.  With that in mind, we
are pleased to announce the following organization changes within Global
Technology:

Jay Fitzgerald, MD eCommerce, will be moving to Enron North America and will
have responsibility for all of ENA,s eCommerce initiatives.  Although this
will be a big loss for Global Technology, Jay will provide immediate benefits
to the explosion of eBusiness opportunities that are developing in the ENA
lines of business.  Jay will report to Greg Whalley.

eCommerce Ventures group responsible for eCommerce merchant investing.  The
