Richard, it is my understanding that this investment is currently in Ray Bowen's business.  In my ENA shoes, I would say we would have no interest in taking on that responsibility.  In my EES shoes, I would like to take a closer look at the possible connections.  Please send me some info on the investment fund and their current investments portfolio.

I have also heard that Tom White has been talking to you about EES taking on the Catalytica investment.  With my EES shoes on, no way!!!!

Regards
Delainey
