The compliance department for DB Alex Brown has rejected our comments to the
Prime Brokerage Agreement.  Jason, since the file is in your possession, I
left word with the compliance officer, Terry Finn, to contact you so that
their concerns could be addressed.   Terry's phone number is (410) 895-3602.

Today conversations will be logged in Lotus Notes.  In the interim,  please
let me know if there is anything else you guys want me to do on this issue.
