FYI: One of our legal consultants has mentioned that another of his clients
is setting up an internet derivatives trading system.  They are using an
outfit called Intuitive Products International based in New York and London
to assist with system design.  Tana Jones (x33399) will be setting up a demo
by these folks with our legal department needs in mind - if you'd like to
attend, we'd be happy to have you and ask them to expand their presentation
to include internet trading.
