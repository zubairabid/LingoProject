Open season responses are due from shippers on Friday 11/17.  Please make
sure you canvass all your customers to find out who plans to respond and who
doesn't.  I would like to submit to Steve a list of who we expect to see
responses from, their anticipated volume, term, and price they're willing to
pay.
thanks
