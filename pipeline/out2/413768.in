Brent,

I'm sure there would be no problem with you copying our Master Swap Agreement
database and using it for your contract applications.  It is my hope to use
it for all the ECT trading groups, the Power group has already copies it, I
spoke to London about copying it for their other trading groups, and I have
shown it to other groups, from Global Contracts to EES.  All you would need
to do is change the contract drop downs.  Contact Mike Neves, who is working
on this database for us, and either he, or someone else can be assigned to
developing a similar system for you.
