Dear Vince.
I sent you a reply earlier this month but I haven't heard from you
about
the
date of your visit. Our department has a Seminar every Monday. If
you
can
schedule your visit on a Monday I would like to invite you to give
a
seminar
which will be attended by many of our graduate students and
faculty
and
will
give you an opportunity to tell them about your program. With
sufficient
lead-time I can advertise the seminar in the Hass school to their
financial
engineering students.
Shmuel.
