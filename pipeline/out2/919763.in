See the comment below on Williams' confirmation site.  Sounds similar to what
we are proposing on CL.  One question I'm exploring right now is whether we
could save more money from an Enron perspective and achieve greater
marketability with the model that ConfirmCorp proposes with automated
matching vs. the Commodity Logic/Williams approach that depends on users
reviewing/approving confirms (we've simply put the current process online so
to speak).  We need to push for a more radical change/improvement on a faster
timeline.   I still believe confirms is the correct area to be focusing on,
as I mentioned in our meeting with Louise, but we need to seriously review
what we propose to deliver and how.  Is ConfirmCorp a viable company to bring
under the Enron umbrella?

I think we should be concerned that late entry with less functionality will
erode our ability to sign up customers.  I don't think each large marketer
will want to log in to several sites to clear their confirmations with each
of their large counterparties.

Can we find out if Williams has further plans for their service that would
compete with Commodity Logic?
