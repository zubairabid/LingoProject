Thanks for your prompt response.  I really hope that you can convince Mark
Taylor that transferring the financial confirmations to Calgary is the right
thing to do.  As you recall, we have been down the road of improving the
service to Calgary previously.  This seems to work in the short term, but as
soon as there is turnover in the group, which unfortunately seems to occurs
regularly, the service level starts to drop.  I would like you to consider
the following arguments in favor of transferring this function to Calgary
when you meet with Mark.

First, when the recommendation first came out to transfer to financial
confirmations to Calgary, Mark Taylor's concern was our legal staff.  At that
time, we had one attorney  who did not have expertise in the financial area.
We now have three very competent attorneys.  Greg Johnston has spent time in
Houston and has recently attended an ISDA training course.

Second, there are problems with the confirmations that are prepared by
Houston and with the process itself.  At the time of the Project Doorstep
audit, we provided you with a list of confirmations that had not been sent
out after we had approved them.  As you saw from my memo, confirmations are
periodically sent out without our review.  Also, we have found mistakes in
the confirmations themselves, including the contract date referred to in the
confirmation.  The first two issues cause me a lot of concern.  Some of the
confirmations sent out without our review were wrong, which is a big
problem.  We had a large number of confirmations that were never sent out,
which is even a bigger problem.

Third, there is no real additional control in the process by having Houston
generate the confirmations.  If you think about what the process is, the
transactions are done in Calgary, we fax the deal sheets to Houston, the
confirmation is generated using a template that has been pre-approved by
legal, we review and approve the confirmation and execute them on-line if
done by Enron Canada Corp., or send an e-mail if the Enron Entity is Enron
North America.  Houston faxes the confirms to the counterparty.  If the
counterparty is a trading company, Houston follows up on the status of
execution.  For all other entities, the Calgary office is now doing the
follow-up.  All these transactions are currently settled out of the Calgary
office.  If the transactions were done in Calgary, we would be using the same
pre-approved templates that Houston is using.  It is not clear to me where
there is any additional control by having the confirmations done in Houston,
or, conversely, why there is any additional risk in having Calgary prepare
our own financial confirmations.  If there is some perception that an element
of risk exists by having Calgary prepare the financial confirmations, why are
we allowed to prepare the physical confirmations?

Fourth, there is a duplication of effort by having the preparation done in
Houston while the review process is done in Calgary.  Currently, Houston has
staff handling the Calgary transactions.  Because the confirmations are
reviewed and approved here, I have similar staff who print the confirmations,
route them for review, update TAGG, notify Houston when the review is
complete, and then follow-up with either Houston or the counterparty on
issues or execution.  We are currently following up on all non-trading
company financial confirmations.  So, we are both printing and reviewing the
transactions, following up with the counterparties, and filing these
documents.  As I stated before, Calgary could assume full responsibility for
the financial confirmations without adding any staff.

Fifth, there is an increase in the amount of time needed to get the
confirmations to the counterparty by having the preparation done in Houston.
Because of the number of times the information has to go back and forth, the
confirmations rarely get to the counterparty within 24 hours of the
transaction being done.  We feel this time line could be met if we did the
financial confirmations here.  This reduces risk for Enron.

Finally, because we are a small office, I need the opportunity to develop my
existing employees so that they don't feel that they need to leave the
company in order to broaden their knowledge base.  Given the skill sets of
the documentation group, it is difficult for them to move into other areas
such as risk, logistics, or accounting, so it is important that I am able to
keep them challenged within the documentation group.  Because we review the
confirmations, the basic understanding of the financial transactions already
exists.  However, I know that my employees would appreciate having full
accountability and responsibility for this function, and have the opportunity
to develop more expertise in the area of financial confirmations.

As a final note, I report to you.  I am fully accountable to you for ensuring
that all the necessary controls are in place to handle this function
properly.  It would mean a lot to me, as well as the documentation staff, to
get your vote of confidence in making the case to legal to transfer this
function to Calgary.  Mark Taylor has never met me or my staff, yet I get the
impression that he doesn't think we are capable of handling this function.  I
hope that you will be able to set him straight on this.  He just needs to
look at the results of our annual audits to see the level of competency that
exists here.

If you have any questions or need any additional clarification on anything in
this memo, please let me know.  As you can see, the Calgary office feels very
strongly about this issue, including Rob Milthorp and Peter Keohane.  Please
let me know how your meeting with Mark goes.

Thanks,
Peggy
