I ended up staying up (must have been that last cup of coffee!) and revising
the agreement last night.  Attached is a clean copy.  I am having my
secretary run the blackline this am and she will email it to you (her name is
Deborah Morris, so look for an email from her.)  IMPORTANT!-- There are
several bracketed notes in italics that call to your attention items for your
input.  These are intended to be removed before this goes to VEPCO!
Kay--I'll call you later today or tomorrow, after we get their changes and
have a chance to review them.  Best regards.
