Paul -

Thanks for your voice mail.  We can't print the list of Reference Entities
from the website because we have not been given access.  We do need to get
that list to the various other reviewers in Houston and I am sure that is the
list that Michael referred to.

The EnronOnline people are probably concerned because they don't have a final
list of Reference Entities for their launch.  That list absolutely must be
scrubbed by the other GC's before it is approved.

Mark
