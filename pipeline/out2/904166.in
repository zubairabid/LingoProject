Internet Tip of the Day

Arctic Trucks

I was watching a cable TV show about these guys from Iceland who drove
modified Toyota Land Cruisers across Antarctica -- more plush than a dogsled,
you may be sure. It looked like quite an adventure. The neat thing was their
Web address on the  side of the vehicles -- www.arctictrucks.is. I reached
over, typed in the URL, and soon had their site up. I even sent an e-mail,
and I got a quick response. Kinda neat the way the Web makes the world
smaller. Here I was, watching TV in America about Icelanders at the South
Pole, and communicating directly with them (in Iceland) at the same time. If
I'd been in the market for a SUV modified for arctic conditions, they'd have
probably made a sale. They take Toyota Land Cruisers (or other SUVs) and
modify them to cruise comfortably over ice and snow in the coldest weather
you can imagine. Rescue vehicles are a specialty. If you need one, here's the
source!
