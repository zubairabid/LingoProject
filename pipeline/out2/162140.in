Battle of the bulge



picture









Chase Manhattan bought Wall Street's bluest-blooded bank, J.P. Morgan, for
rather over $30 billion. This is easily the largest of a series of deals over
the past year aimed at propelling Chase into the "bulge bracket" elite. The
merged bank, J.P. Morgan Chase, will lead the market in many areas of
investment banking but will still lack "bulge" status in such fields as
equity underwriting and mergers and acquisitions.

Dresdner Bank, Germany's third-largest, looked abroad after the failure of
recent high-profile mergers with large domestic rivals. Dresdner was said to
be close to buying Wasserstein Perella, a small American investment bank, for
around $1.3 billion.


General Electric's financial-services business, GE Capital, appeared near to
a deal to acquire Scottish Life, a diminutive mutually-owned pensions
company, for about o1 billion ($1.4 billion).


A proposed merger between the London Stock Exchange and Germany's Deutsche
Borse collapsed. The LSE abandoned the deal in order to fight off a hostile
bid from OM, the company that runs Sweden's exchange. The race to create a
pan-European exchange opened up as possible bidders for the LSE, including
Deutsche Borse itself, circled; LSE made the improbable suggestion that it
was now "better equipped to take the initiative."

The London International Financial Futures Exchange suffered a three-hour
failure of its electronic-trading system, Connect. The breakdown may prove a
setback for LIFFE; it hopes to sell the system to other exchanges, including
the LSE.


A bit more oil


OPEC responded to pressure from the world's leading oil importers and agreed
to increase oil-production quotas by 800,000 barrels a day. It is unclear how
much new oil will reach the market, as only Saudi Arabia has much spare
capacity. OPEC, unsure how the market would react, agreed to meet again in
November-four months ahead of schedule.

Japan's economy continued its tentative recovery, as GDP grew by 1% between
April and June compared with the previous quarter, the second consecutive
quarter of growth. Although it coincided with a big increase in public
spending, consumption also rose, giving some hope that the recovery may
continue.


America's current-account deficit set a new record, rising by a sizeable 4.6%
in the second quarter to $106 billion; however, this showing is still some
way below forecasts. Imports have surged as the country's economy has boomed,
but markets for America's exports have not picked up as far or as fast.


The European Central Bank and euro-area finance ministers issued a joint
statement affirming their confidence in the euro. The finance ministers also
announced that efforts to bolster the currency would include renaming
themselves the Euro Group and lengthening their meetings. The euro again hit
a record low against the dollar.


Good in parts


America's antitrust authorities gave regulatory approval to an online
business-to-business car parts exchange set up by Ford, General Motors and
DaimlerChrysler; but the Covisint venture still requires the thumbs-up from
Germany's competition watchdogs. Other big companies planning to reduce costs
through pooled Internet procurement will welcome the news that the concerns
of competition authorities can be overcome.


DaimlerChrysler took advantage of Mitsubishi Motors' recent travails-it is
accused of covering up defects in its cars for several years-and installed
its own man, Rolf Eckrodt, as chief operating officer of the debt-laden
Japanese car maker. The German firm also knocked 10% off the purchase price
for its 34% stake-now worth only $1.9 billion. It can now increase its stake
after three years rather than ten, as agreed originally.

In a small sign that America's boom may be slowing, General Motors announced
that it would cut North American vehicle production by 4% in the last quarter
of the year. It still intends to make 677,000 cars, or 11% more than in the
same period last year.


Kingfisher, a big British retail group, announced that it will demerge its
British retail chains, Woolworths and Superdrug, from its B&Q and Comet
stores. The group, whose shares have underperformed badly, also issued a
profits warning.


Dome doomed?


Nomura, a Japanese bank, pulled out of a deal to buy Britain's much
criticised and poorly attended Millennium Dome for o105m ($148m). The bank,
which had a large team investigating the deal, claimed that it had been
unaware previously of the financial confusion, unforeseen costs and future
liabilities at the Dome.

Hewlett-Packard, an American technology company, is in talks with
PricewaterhouseCoopers to buy the consultancy arm from the "big five"
accountancy firm. HP would rapidly expand its consultancy capability at a
time when IT firms need to offer both consultancy and technology; PwC would
satisfy American regulators who think there is a conflict of interest between
auditing and consulting.

Wind, a telecoms company owned by France Telecom and Enel, an Italian
utility, entered talks with Vodafone AirTouch to buy Infostrada, Italy's
second-largest fixed-line telecoms concern, for euro11.5 billion ($9.9
billion). Vodafone acquired Infostrada with its takeover of Mannesmann, but
it is keen to divest non-mobile assets and use the cash to bid for more
third-generation mobile licences.
