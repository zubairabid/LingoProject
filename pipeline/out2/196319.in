Jonny,

Thank you so much for the email and kind words.  I was very moved by it and
you know I feel the same way.  I have become very reflective with the more
"success" that I have been fortunate enough to receive.  I am so thankful
and appreciative and although I have always been religious and spiritual,
it has grown more deeply.  I see so many people that have lost their
perspective and I pray that I will remain grounded and truly appreciate the
blessings that our family has received.  Chris and I often discuss how we
can help others and what can we do to really make a difference.

The Jones and the McConnells are truly very lucky.   Thanks, and give my
love to your family.

Mike


PS:  What about OU - Texas, do you have any ideas or plans already in the
works?
