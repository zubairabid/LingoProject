Dave/John:

Attached is a recommended strategy for addressing the Cushion Gas issue with
AEP.  Bottom line is:

1. Hedge our obligation now - understand that John has already done this.
2. Begin working with AEP to get their bid on purchasing the Cushion Gas from
us (at a premium that will cover the cost of the additional 5.5 bcf)
3. Begin working with the banks regarding the cost/potential for Enron to
re-monetize the Cushion Gas at a higher basis (again to cover the cost of the
additional 5.5 bcf).  At a minimum, this gives us additional negotiating
leverage with AEP.
4. Re-classify the 5.5 bcf from PP&E to a long term asset to delay
recognition of the higher cost.
5. Once we get AEP's bid on purchasing the pad gas - introduce the fact that
we mistakenly omitted from the balance sheet a 2007 liability to re-inject
the 5.5 bcf of pad gas.  Offer for Enron to assume this 2007 liability.
6. If necessary we can also look at a higher threshold for the A/S line
liability, as I think that the risk that additional repairs will be required
is low.

Any comments/direction is appreciated,
Brian
