Hey Kev,

Good to hear from you.  Hope all is well.  Well we out here in the Golden
State
could certainly use some help from you and the boys at
Enron...................
Gray Davis is a little mouse!  That about describes most peoples opininion of
him.  The power and natural gas situation out here is a mess!  The gas
situation
is much worse for us at this point here in Long Beach.  We haven't seen any
power outages or any significant increase in our bill either.  The gas front
is
an entirely different matter!  I just paid a $300 bill for the month of Dec.
I
paid $100 for the same month in 1999.  The usage (therms) was the
same............ figure that one out?!?!  At that level I might as well be
paying for heating oil in Maine.  Most people I talk to have scene their gas
bill go up 2 or 3 fold.

Anyway, things could be a whole lot worse I guess.  Luke just had his 1st
birthday party this past weekend.  It was quite the scene.  I think his next
party will be when he is 18.  Say hello to Lisa for us.

TJ
