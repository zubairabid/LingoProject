After getting your imput, I think this is the best:

We will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be
differing messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need
to hear that they are not performing at a high enought level relative to
peers to help us achieve business goals or for them to be considered for a
bonus (may need to finda another role within or outside Enron which is a
better fit).  Message to someone new to Enron in that category should be
different.  Glad they are here: believe that as they learn the organization
and their job that they will be able to make significant contribution: doing
the right thing to learn business, but that contributions to date are not
significant enough to warrant payment of a bonus.

Let me know what you think.

thanks
