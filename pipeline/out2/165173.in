Amid signs that America,s economy is slowing, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, admitted that inflation was no longer his primary concern.
He also hinted that he would act if the economy slowed too sharply. Markets
interpreted this as a sign that the Fed would soon cut interest rates.
America,s tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped by 10%, its biggest-ever daily gain, and
the Dow Jones Industrial Average went up by 3%, though both fell back a bit
the next day.

The IMF offered new loans of $7.5 billion (and a total package worth $10.4
billion) to Turkey, in an attempt to contain Turkey,s financial and banking
crisis. The IMF is also negotiating new loans to Argentina, another troubled
emerging economy.

Gerhard Schr"der, Germany,s chancellor, said that Russian debt owed to
Germany (around half of the total of $48 billion owed to the Paris Club of
western governments) could be swapped for stakes in Russian companies. As a
long-term solution, this has merits; but next year Russia is scheduled to
repay $3.9 billion, and has so far allocated only a quarter of this sum.

Japan,s GDP grew by only 1.0% at an annual rate in the third quarter, a
similar rate to the previous quarter, after growth had surged at the start of
the year. Japan has introduced a new system for calculating GDP, although it
may be no more reliable than previous methods.

Freeserve, at a price

Wanadoo, France,s biggest Internet service provider, is to buy Britain,s
biggest ISP, Freeserve, with shares worth some o1.6 billion ($2.3 billion).
Wanadoo, 88% owned by France Telecom, will become one of Europe,s top three
ISPs alongside Germany,s T-Online and Italy,s Tiscali. Both were also
rumoured to have been interested in Freeserve.

EM.TV, a struggling German TV company, began a sell-off of assets and
acquired a partner after announcing profits way below forecasts. Kirch Group,
a German media firm, is to take a 17% stake in the company and will pay $500m
for 49% of an EM.TV subsidiary that owns 50% of Formula One motor racing.
EM.TV also sold the rights to some &Sesame Street8 TV characters for $180m.
Its shares continued to plunge.

Reuters, a British media group, announced a successor to replace Peter Job as
chief executive when he retires next July. Tom Glocer, head of Reuters, main
information division, will become the first American (and first
non-journalist) to run the company.

The revival of Apple Computer, overseen by Steve Jobs, chief executive and
co-founder, suffered a sharp setback after a profits warning. The company
expects a loss in the quarter to the end of the year, and its revenues are
trailing behind forecasts.

British Telecom sold bonds worth $10 billion, offering high yields to
compensate for its ballooning debt and rickety credit rating. Initial public
offerings by Norway,s Telenor and Portugal Telecom both fell below their
offer prices when trading began.

Nokia, the world,s leading mobile-phone maker, said that revenues were likely
to remain strong until 2003 and that the world would see its one-billionth
mobile subscriber by early 2002, rather than the end of this year. Nokia also
dismissed suggestions that WAP and other Internet-enabled devices would not
catch on.

I,m all right, Jack

After losing out in the race to succeed Jack Welch at General Electric, two
top executives departed. Robert Nardelli, in charge of GE Power Systems, will
become chief executive at Home Depot, an American DIY retailer. And James
McNerney, head of GE Aircraft Engines, will take up the chief executive,s
role at 3M, a diversified manufacturer. Shares in both companies shot up.

PepsiCo agreed to acquire Quaker Oats, an American food and drink company,
for shares worth $13.4 billion. Quaker had turned down an offer from PepsiCo;
a bid from Coca-Cola was halted by Coke,s own board. PepsiCo gets Quaker,s
Gatorade brand, which has an 84.1% share of the &sports8 drink market in
America.

Corus, forged from the merger of British Steel and Hoogovens, a Dutch rival,
abandoned its experiment of employing two chief executives. Both are to
leave. The unwieldy compromise, needed to facilitate the merger, slowed down
decision-making at a time of declining demand for steel, which had led to
losses and a declining share price.

Pernod Ricard and Diageo announced that they had agreed to bid jointly for
the drinks business of Seagram, which is to be auctioned for a sum likely to
exceed $7 billion after Seagram completes its merger with Vivendi, a French
conglomerate. A side-deal by the suppliers of Captain Morgan, Seagram,s
premium rum, with Allied Domecq, rivals for the rest of Seagram, has not
deterred Pernod and Diageo. Bacardi, in alliance with Brown-Forman, an
American firm, is also interested.

Bad banks

Bank of America issued a profit warning for the fourth quarter, blaming
rising bad debts and poor investment-banking results. Its shares hit a
12-month low.

Deutsche Bank announced that it would reorganise its five main units into
only two, covering investment banking and asset management, and retail
operations. The bank hopes to take advantage of cross-selling opportunities
in both units.

ING Barings, an Anglo-Dutch investment bank with a doubtful future, lost its
chairman and his deputy. The departures may foreshadow a greater exodus.
