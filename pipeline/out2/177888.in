This order may be an opportunity to get additional back-up generation quickly
installed at customer's facilities in WA State.  It is only applicable for
onsight energy use - not selling to the grid.

On January 29, 2001 Governor Gary Locke signed Energy Supply Order No. 01-02,
suspending regulations pertaining to construction and portable source
requirements of the Washington Administrative Code (WAC 173-400-110) and
local air pollution control authority regulations adopted under RCW 70.94.152
for 30 days.  The 30 days suspension was granted to allow temporary electric
generators that may be a major source of air pollution to be installed or
constructed by utilities and other users of electricity without receiving a
construction approval from the state. The order allows non-utilities to
generate the electricity to offset their existing demand.  However,
non-utilities cannot sell the generated electricity.  The purpose of the
Order was to get sources generating electricity on line immediately.  The
order has now been extended to March 27, 2001 and is known as &Energy Supply
Order No. 01-04.8  It is likely the extension will continue.

The basic differences between this Energy Order and a regular plan approval
process is

1. Facility is allowed to operate a generator immediately without prior
construction approval.  However, the facility has to meet the same
requirements as they would if they were applying for a regular construction
approval and operating permit.
2. No control device is required on the source.  Under the Order, Washington
Department of Ecology will allow a source to operate without control on a
temporary basis.  They are thinking of defining &temporary8 as less than six
months.  After that the source must install a control device.  It is unclear
if a construction plan approval will be required to install the control
device at that time.
3. The facility must obtain offsets or have a plan indicating how they are
going to get offsets in the Energy Alert notification to the Department.
There must be enough emission offsets to cover the operating time it would
normally take to receive a plan approval from the Department.  The normal
time frame to receive a plan approval from the Department is approximately
one month.

The only advantage with the Order is that a source can operate immediately
and without control device on a temporary basis as long as they follow all
the requirements listed.
