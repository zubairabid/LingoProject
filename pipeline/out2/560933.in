The companies that are our primary competition in this area are the Big 5
accounting firms.  They interview in May of a 5 year PPA's 3rd year for a
Spring Internship in the 4th year.  We must attract 4th year PPAs in the fall
before their spring internship or 3rd year PPAs in the spring.  We need to do
alot more planning on this between now and next fall but I definitely want to
interview for interns both in the spring and fall.  Thanks
