Peter:

I understand from Tana that you disagree with the advice we have received
from outside counsel (Stikeman) regarding the necessary
procedures/formalities involved in the taking and holding of cash as
collateral in Canada.  We are in the process of revising our Canadian forms
for ISDA master agreements and credit support annexes.  Would you mind
checking into this issue - maybe by discussing your difference of opinion
with Stikeman (I think the advice came from Fred Erickson in their Calgary
office)?  I don't want to make our forms overly complicated or impose burdens
on ourselves that aren't required by law.

Thanks,

Mark
