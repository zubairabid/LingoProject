SUMMARY

Congress has enacted landmark legislation that for the
first time will
establish national standards governing the validity of electronic signatures,
contracts and records.
The "Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act" is expected
to be signed into
law by President Clinton this week or next.  Many provisions of the Act
relating to the validity of
electronic signatures will become effective on October 1, 2000.  Other
significant provisions relating
to the maintenance and retention of records will become effective March 1,
2001.
