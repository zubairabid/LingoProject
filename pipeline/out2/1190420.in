You're right, we have not agreed to the final sentence with any of our other
counterparties.  I doubt that the EOL people will let us do it (though we can
always ask).  I have sometimes gotten counterparties comfortable with this
issue by suggesting that the master user id and password should be held by
someone in the back office, the control group or even the legal department so
that when a trader leaves the master user can immediately shut them off.  It
seems to me that this puts the risk and responsibility for dealing with
rogues where it belongs - why should we be at risk if one of their traders
decides to damage the company?  Having said that, I think that even without
the last sentence requested we are probably in that position - if we have
actually received the notice and request for termination of the password and
don't do it, it would be very hard to defend if we kept doing trades and they
can show they weren't authorized.
