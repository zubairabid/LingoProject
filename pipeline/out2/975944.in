Hi Vince,

Talking to the staff in London, I heard that Lynda Clemmons and a few of the
key Weather Desk members left to start their own business.  I am hearing that
London may gain more independence from Houston and gain its own book and,
interestingly, also having ideas about developing the insurance/ insurance
derivatives market.  I therefore thought this might be a useful opportunity
to formalise a gradual transfer of responsibility for weather deal pricing
from Joe to myself plus start talking to Vasant about the new markets on the
insurance side.  I will call you later to discuss this with you.

Regards,

Anjam
