Dear Colleague,
Having invoked the Govt Of India Gaurantee yesterday, this has no doubt
received front page media attention across the country. While we will be
circulating some of this around, I forward this particularly interesting
editorial from The Economic Times.  For those of us who question the state
governments stance refusing to pay and face the frequently encountered charge
of high tariff etc,  here's what the countries most widely read and
influential daily has independantly to say in our support:

A Deserved Downgrade, ( EDITORIAL)

THE rating assigned to four government of Maharashtra supported bonds has,
rightly, been downgraded by Crisil, following non-payment of dues to the
Dabhol Power Corporation by the state government. Predictably, Maharashtra
finance minister Jayant Patil has objected to the downgrade, but that only
shows how out of touch politicians are with commercial reality. This is a
problem not just in Maharashtra but in all states. Politicians have got used
to the nawabi notion that rulers do not really have to pay their legal dues,
and any payments they actually make are a sort of favour.

Maharashtra was earlier regarded as one of the best state governments. But
now it is in fiscal difficulties, like all others. Mr Patil claims Dabhol is
a special case, reflecting not fiscal distress but a political decision not
to pay. Sorry, Mr Patil, but any entity that believes it can default on
payment for political reasons deserves to be punished since it is
demonstrably unreliable. Many believe the Dabhol deal was a high-cost one. So
what? Dozens of public sector projects have suffered cost overruns, but that
is no reason for refusing to pay their dues. The whole point of commercial
rules is that you must abide by the rules of the game even when they involve
a loss. You can legitimately withhold payment only if the original deal was
crooked and broke the law.

This was the accusation made against Dabhol in the mid 1990s, but detailed
investigation failed to unearth evidence of wrong-doing, and dozens of legal
petitions were dismissed by the courts. Cynics say that lack of evidence in
India does not mean innocence. But that cynicism can apply to every single
power project in India, including public sector projects. In life, we all
make some good deals and some bad ones, and need to abide by them
nevertheless. State governments cannot escape this commercial rule. No state
should renege on a deal merely because it was a bad one. If it does so, it
deserves to be downgraded as an unreliable and risky economic partner. The
Crisil downgrade may not mean much of a rise in the state,s immediate
borrowing costs. But it will affect the state,s once-awesome reputation, and
that could be a far higher real cost.
