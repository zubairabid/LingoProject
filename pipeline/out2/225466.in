We need the revised confirm now.  I'd like to review it when you're done.  I
sent the legal opinion draft to Deseret yesterday and they are sending their
draft back shortly  (I received a fax from them at 9:30 am today). Thanks.  SS

Mike:  Do you want to see our legal opinion draft and/or Deseret's draft
opinion to be sent shortly?
