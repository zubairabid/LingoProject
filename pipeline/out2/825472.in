Enron,s ePowered Market Cast Solution
ePowered Market Cast, an application of the Enron Intelligent Network, is an
end-to-end streaming media solution for banks, brokerages and other financial
services firms.  Using ePowered Market Cast, companies can enhance investor
relations, conduct virtual road shows and stream analyst presentations from
their websites.  In addition, ePowered Market Cast is a powerful intranet
solution for providing real-time financial news, data feeds, training and
presentations to an internal audience.  The application streams video at an
average bit-rate speed of 200 kilobits per second (kbps).
The Enron Intelligent Network is based on distributed server architecture, a
pure Internet Protocol (IP) platform and embedded software intelligence that
sets it apart from other networks.  The EIN,s enhanced performance is due to
its ability to deliver streaming media content &one hop8 away from the user
at the closest EIN edge server.  The result is a TV-quality viewing
experience for the user.  In contrast, the public Internet,s ability to
deliver the broadband content businesses need is often hampered by packet
loss, interference and other disruptions that slow down transmission speed
and compromise the end user,s experience.
