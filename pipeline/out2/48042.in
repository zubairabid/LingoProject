Touche'
Clearly those in power are interested in one thing--preserving their
privileged position and the status quo.  My opponent is for big lycra.  I
don't trust big lycra.  I trust the people, and their own ears.
I will make a pledge right now that if I am selected to win next year in
advance, I will NOT wear camouflage lycra on Halloween.  (This pledge alone
should ensure my victory).
Furthermore, since my worthy opponent nearly had to pass out earplugs as a
form of defense against the colorful nature of his costume, I think he should
be the last to make allegations regarding "visual impairment."  Is that what
"visions and values" is all about?
