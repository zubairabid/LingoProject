Sara  I   have  informed  BP  Amoco.  I  spoke  to  Bill ,  a  VP  who
informed  that  the  telephone  number  that  the
person  that  called  me  is  not  a  BP  Amoco  line,  however  the  fax
number  is  a  one  that  is  in their  trading  room.
I  was  also  told  that  Michelle Reasor  is  the  trader  and  would
have  been  the  one  making  any  inquiry  requests
of  us.  He  investigating.  He  highly  complemented  us  on  our
security  measures.  Thanks,  Willie
