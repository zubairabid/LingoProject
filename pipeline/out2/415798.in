The way this came about, Sheila has a customer that was creating a new
internal and, initially she contacted Sara and it was Sara's understanding
that they were in the tranportation business, not trading, and wanted to use
the word "exchange" in their company name, and did we, as the CFTC experts,
know any reason why they shouldn't (I also understand it was Julia that
mentioned to Sheila she might have an issue there).  After my email went out,
Sheila came around with the press release they were drafting, and it sure
sounded in the press release that this company's business was more toward the
exchange and less toward the tranportation.  They used words like "online
clearinghouse" and the like!  So I told Sheila maybe she'd better contact Ken
Raisler directly since it seemed like she had a real problem there.  I
haven't spoken to her to find out what came out of it.
