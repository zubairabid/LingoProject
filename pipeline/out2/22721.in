Ken,
Thank you very much for giving Gordon and me so much time.  It was a
real pleasure seeing you again, and I certainly hope we get to do something
together.  Gordon and Greg are going to continue their discussion around
specific issues.  For IFC, I am actively talking to your team on weather
insurance and  think we can proceed.   It would good for me to stay in
touch with you---I have already explained to Peter Woicke, the head of IFC,
that Enron  and GEC are really the models for us in modern finance and
markets.   If you ever have time in Washington, please do give a call.
Have a wonderful holiday season.
Best,   Nina
