E-mail / Voice Mail Retention Policy Change Notice
We have just received notice of a change to the e-mail and voice mail
retention policy.  The change will go into effect Friday, December 15, 2000.
The greatest impact will be to your "sent mail," which will be retained only
30 days as compared to the current 365 days.
As a reminder, you should not use the email system to store important
documents.
They should be saved to your network directory which is regularly backed up.
However, for 'sent' messages you want to keep longer than 30 days in the
email system, you should move the messages from the Sent Mail to a specific
folder where the messages can be kept 365 days.
The scope of the e-mail retention policy includes all forms of electronic
mail, for example, Lotus Notes Mail, Internet e-mail, Outlook e-mail, and
voice mail.
Enron supports a work environment in which information is freely exchanged
and encourages employees, contractors, and agents working on behalf of Enron
to use its computers and related electronic resources in accomplishing their
work.  Computers, systems, and networks and the work products they contain
are Enron property and subject to Enron review and control.  All Enron
employees, contractors, and agents are responsible for using the computing
resources provided to them by Enron in an appropriate manner.
The revised retention schedule follows:
Message Location    Maximum Retention
Inbox     30 Days
Message Log/Sent Mail   30 Days
Trash     Rollover from Inbox for 15 days
Bulletin Boards    30 Days
Folders/Archives    E-mails placed in Folders or Archives ) one year
Voice mail     90 days
The Corp IT Group responsible for maintaining compliance with this
e-mail/voice mail policy will automatically purge e-mail and voice mail older
than the allowed maximum retention age.  Any exception to this policy
requires approval from Mark Haedicke or Richard Sanders.
