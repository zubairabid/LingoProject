Jeff-
From a legal perspective, the traders are not supposed to have the authority
to let out another entity from an EnronOnline trade. If the trade is the
result of a system malfunction or some other uncontrollable issue, the
customer can get with the trader and agree to reverse out an existing EOL
transaction with an OTC trade, but Commercial should not be letting customers
out of EOL deals simply because their traders "clicked on the wrong product".
This is the policy that Mark Taylor and Legal have had in place since the
inception of EOL.
I'll get with Sheri and Jennifer and we will see what Legal has to say, but,
if Mike Maggi and/or John Arnold have been verbally allowing customers to
change these Gas Daily trades in the past, it definitely creates a problem
from the perspective of trying to hold them to the same trades now. The best
advise I can give right now is to make sure that John and Mike do not
continue allowing customers out of their trades simply because they "clicked
on the wrong product". The legal responsibility for "clicking on the right
product" lies firmly with the customer and whenever Commercial starts
allowing them out of that responsibility it can create serious legal problems
when and if one of these trades comes back to bite them.
