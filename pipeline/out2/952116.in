Geynille,
I understand you are in charge of recruiting at the UofH. I am forwarding to
you the resume
of one of the students  of the University of Houston.
She is involved with the international organization called AIESEC and I was
most
impressed by her organizational skills and professional attitude. I used
to work as a volunteer for this organization many years ago and I am
still helping their local chapter.
As far as I know, she signed up for an interview with Enron.
