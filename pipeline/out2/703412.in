Ahoy again,
Because of all the positive response, I called the  Windjammer Barefoot
Cruise group department and negotiated a 20% savings  for two different
cruises.

LEGACY: October  28-November 3cruise
**Aruba, Bonaire, Curacao, Venezuela,  Aruba
Ensign Cabins  (bunks) Reg. $1000, our cruise, $800
Commodore (Double Bed) Reg.  $1125, our cruise, $900
Port  charges,  $90.00
NO CHARGE FOR THE  STOWAWAY
Fare Share  will apply. It is $890 from PDX, will be less for those of
you to the  East. Once you have made a deposit I can get the Fare Share rate
from your  airport.

WJ is in the process of negotiating with hotels in Aruba. I  will not be
doing group hotel arrangements; I will share info about  hotels, and those
who want to stay over can do their own.

POLYNESIA: November 5-10  Repositioning Cruise (For those wanting to do a
Back to Back)
**From St. Lucia to St. Maarten
Theme Cruise: Sea of Wellness,
with Massage  Therapists, Yoga, etc.
Deck  Cabins, Reg. $1100, our cruise,  $880
Standard Cabins, Reg. $900,  our cruise: $720
BQ,  Reg. $700, our cruise $560
Port  Charges $65

THE CATCH: WJ group department will only  deal with one person, so all
payments and questions have topass through  me. If we don't get 15 people,
the rate reverts to the regular  rate. So, enlist your funnestbuddies to
come along, too.

HOW TO GET IN ON THE DEAL:
1). Decide which week(s) you want to sail
2). Send a $200 deposit for each cruise and $100 additional  if you plan to
use Fare Share
Checks can be made out to WJ or to me,  and sentto  me at: PO BOX
1723, Newport, Oregon  97365
You can use your credit card. Send  me the # and  expiration date, or
you can give it to me on the    phone. My number is:  (541)765-4577.
3). IF you want to use Fare Share, let me know which days  you want to arrive
and depart, and from which airport.

Simple as 1-2-3.

Looking forward to seeing you!
Gail
