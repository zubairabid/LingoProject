Jeff:
Re: you comment below that "...they'll be subject to a considerable amount
of pressure to pre-approve if a deal is offered that can be show to shield
San Diegans from volatility and that looks"attractive."   The CPUC did not
pre-approve either SDG&E or SCE recent attempts to buy forward.   I don't
think they ever will give pre-granted reasonableness review for purchases.
That is why boith utilites decided not to execute as part of their recent
RFPs.  PG&E RFP is up next...I expect more of the same.
