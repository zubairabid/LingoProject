Dan,

I'll check with ENA again on the currency swap.  I have spoken with the a
couple of times about these and they indicate that it is being circulated
through Law on their side (very slow).
The Lyons base gas sale contract will be a fixed price sale contract pursuant
to NNG's rate schedule SF (I would not consider this contract to be a
derivative, it is a sale pursuant to an approved FERC rate schedule).  Morgan
is working with Legal to create this contract.
I thought that the NNG/TW amendment of terms had been completed.  I'll check
with Drew, and if they are not completed we should be able to complete these
in a couple of days (thanks for the heads-up)
Regarding the October purchase contracts: I'll forward this to Morgan for his
handling of that issue.
Regarding the monthly sale to Kansas Gas:  I'm not familiar with this
agreement???

I'll be in Houston on Monday and Tuesday if you want to catch me on any of
these issues.
