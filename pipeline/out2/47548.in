Group,

Please use the Alberta Phone Log next to the PX trade app.  We need to record
the exact time and instructions from each separate conversation.  After
writing it down, please transfer your notes to the alberta power dispatch log
on their web site.  This log can be found at http://albertapower
Go to the admin tab, and use the dispatch log portion (this site is very
similar to the California Daily book site).  Like everything else, the more
detail the better.

Also, we need to make sure that mws are in the "merit order" before we
dispatch them.  So if Transalta offers us 5 mws, we only want to take those
if all 353 mws of ours are dispatched.  Otherwise we are not going to have
the pool taking our mws at the final bid price, and we will not be maximizing
the value of our unit.

IF you have questions, and you should, please see me, Ryan or Monica.  I am
always available for phone calls and will explain whatever you may not have
picked up from the various emails or manual in your box.

Bill
