Nice photo Fred. How convenient of Woody to give directions to his fellow
Betas waiting on the green, inviting their participation in a Beta BooFoo ala
Drow. As for the other two guys in the photo, aren't they Officer Caffey of
SMU Security and Willis Tate? They never could catch Drow while he was an
undergraduate at SMU.
