With PMA's, volumes can be adjusted through the system as usual and I can
adjust the demand fee on the Sitara ticket.  I am not able to follow your ua4
calculation.  However, there was imbalance payback that occurred throughout
September and October.  (This should have been pathed to the Lone Star
transport k in Unify).  Is this in that ua4 number?  Williams had been trying
to make up volumes from prior periods, so that's probably why their volume
came in greater than booked.  (Much of their gas is from El Paso and volumes
vary each day from scheduled.)  The volumes that they were trying to make up
would go toward the transport imbalance also.  I would think that Cleburne
will carry an imbalance on Lone Star from month to month.  After Novemeber,
the imbalance should be fairly small.  Our scheduler, Mark McCoy will have
that number.  (When we took over this deal, the imbalance on Lone Star was
very large.   When the plant went down in Sep, we decided to payback the
imbalance then, so that we could take advantage of higher winter sales prices
if the opportunity came up.)
The agreement does not specifically state anything about ua4.  But, I will
discuss that with Legal.  The intent is for all costs, including ua4 and
fuel, to be covered by Tenaska IV.
I will be leaving at 1pm today and will return on Tuesday 12/19.  We can get
together then if you would like.
