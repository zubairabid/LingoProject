Grant,
I have reviewed your requested changes and have made the changes which do
not require explanation or clarification.  Those changes are reflected in the
above document.  Let me go over your list of items:
1. I have deleted the word "DRAFT".
2. I have left a blank for the date within the month of March 2001 when the
contract would be executed by the City.
3. I have changed the word "may" to "shall".
4. Maximum Daily Delivery Point Quantity does not fit in a Deficiency
Default, it is just the maximum quantity that can be handled by a party at a
particular point.  I do not think their is an omission.
5. I have added the word "reasonable".
6. The procedue for how the Termination Payment is determined is provided,
if the City disagrees with the method and values provided in the statement
and is unable to convince the Company to revise, the statement, then the
issue is to be resolved in arbitration.  At the point that a Termination
Payment calculation is necessary, a long drawn out period should not be
necessary to attain closure.
7. We need to limit the duration to 30 days,  neither party should be
required to wait 60 days before it could accelerate the other party's
obligations under the Contract.  We might be able to add language to extend
the period if we had some documentation stating the steps that a party was
pursuing to cause the proceeding to be dismissed and the other party was
otherwise kept whole from a credit exposure.
8. I have kept the 30 days because 5 days is too short a period.  During a
holiday period, one scheduling error could cover the entire period.  Article
3 has language which provides a remedy for a party if a scheduling default
extends for more than 5 days during any month.
9. The reason is because Enron Corp. is the rated entity and no separate
rating applies to ENA.
10. I have changed "a" to "the"
11. I have eliminated the  60 day limitation on the duration of an event of
Force Majeure.
12. This merely addressed the possibility of a imbalance amount being due
when a pipeline aggregates imbalances using multiple points, and the language
would allocated the payment based on the amount of the imbalance that a
particular party may have caused.  I think the language is clear as written.
13. The definition of Act was one of the items that I had requested that you
review and complete as necessary so that all appropriate statutes were
referenced.  I am still waiting for your language.  I started filling it in
using language that had been provided by the City.
14. I added the word "reasonable".
15. I have made the requested change relating to GAAAP.
16. This is a late payment provision and as such a believe that the
provision should be more than a party's rating, as such I have kept the 2%
over prime language.
17. These amounts were determined by the credit group and any change needs
to be discussed with that group.  BBB-  is considered investment grade and I
understand that Enron Corp.'s rating is BBB.  ENA is not a rated entity and
that is why the language relates to Enron Corp.'s rating.
18. The elimination of the opinion of counsel did not change the
requirements relating to the representations that we expect the City to have
made.  If the City cannot make these representations, then we need to know
that before we execute the Contract.
19. I have added the word "reasonable".
20. The party that has the Transport Agreement with the Transporter should
have the legal right to obtain the information based on its contract.
21. It is our position that any dispute be arbitrated.  We can agree to
meditation if we can make the outcome binding on the parties.  I am willing
to discuss any changed language that you might care to offer.
22. We have found that personnel of both our Company and that of our
Customers change so rapidily that the list is not workable and merely allows
a party to back out of transactions it does not like on the basis that the
person who agreed to such transaction was not on the list.  Therefore , we
object to any listing of approved parties who can transact.  We believe that
each party should be responsible for the actions of its employees and should
stand behind any transactions that those parties may enter into pursuant to
the terms and provisions of the Contract.
I will be out of the office on Friday, but will be in all next week if you
care to discuss any of these matters.
