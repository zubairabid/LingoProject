Don-

I have left a message for you so that we can discuss this deal.  I spoke to
Ted Murphy briefly about this deal and he wanted to know if ECT has been
involved in this transaction since they would be entering into the swap.  We
have outlined a few issues that may have been addressed already, but maybe we
can discuss these when you have a moment.

Gary Hickerson would need to see this deal due to the CPI and PPI in the
pricing.
The crude desk needs to look at this deal as well since their is also a crude
piece in the pricing.
We also need to address the appropriate credit reserve that needs to be in
place that reflects the credit risk of TBS
Need to see pricing information between EPE and EN

Let's discuss when you have a moment.

Regards,

Pat
