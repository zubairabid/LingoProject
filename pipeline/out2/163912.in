Enron Broadband Services (EBS) has announced plans to enter Japan's telecoms
market with a variety of broadband-related services scheduled to start within
the next three years.

The announcement came at the launch of its wholly-owned subsidiary in Tokyo,
Enron Japan Corp., where Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive officer
of U.S.-based energy giant Enron Corp., spelled out the company's plans for
Japan.

Enron is to offer its clients, including other service providers and
corporates, a broadband fibre optic network - a backbone infrastructure for
network-based video content distribution - and the leasing of bandwidth on
high-capacity telecoms circuits, amongst other services, he said. The company
plans to have its Japanese fiber-optic network in place within the next two
or three years.

&Japan is a large and technologically advanced market, and we believe the
opportunities for our business here are tremendous,8 said Ken Rice, chairman
and chief executive of Enron Broadband Services. &We look forward to
developing mutually beneficial relationships with content providers and
distribution partners in Japan. This will extend our global reach and provide
our Japanese partners with the opportunity to give their customers the
highest quality Internet experience.8

EBS recently announced an agreement with i2, a U.S. electronic software
developer, to provide bandwidth capacity to meet its international networking
needs, including linking i2's Dallas headquarters with its Tokyo location. In
addition, EBS is developing a pooling point in Tokyo, which will facilitate
the buying and selling of bandwidth between Japan and the U.S.

The company also said it hoped to eventually supply Japan with the same
video-on-demand service planned for the U.S., which it is developing with
video rental store chain Blockbuster Inc.

As a first step to competing in Japan, Enron must find a Japanese affiliate
to obtain a Type 1 telecoms carrier license.
