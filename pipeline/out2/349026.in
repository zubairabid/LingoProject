The agenda I'm trying to put together for the next meeting will include the
customary presentations from Davies/Lindsay and Kristol as well as the energy
policy discussion we are looking for from you and Bob.

We will also be updating the council on Enron Networks - - a business unit
formed to extend Enron's business model to other industries (especially
commodities or "commoditzable" goods).   Most recently we have extended into
metals, expanded our presence in paper, and begun an examination of
agricultural commodities.  I'd like your help in identifying a guest
participant who may help us think through some of the issues from either (or
both) of two perspectives:

business strategy:  what markets are candidates for commoditization.  (I have
asked Gary Hamel to consider this topic as well).

public policy:  as more businesses adopt online business models (like
exchanges), as more goods are bought and sold like commodities, and as more
transactions move off the traditional regulated exchanges, how are policy
makers (SEC, FTC, CFTC and their overseas counterparts) likely to react?
