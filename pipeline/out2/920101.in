Hector has still referred to the key players under Jeff Gossett as managers.
However, only one of these (Will Kelly) is a manager.  The remainder are
senior specialists.  Let me know if you would like to discuss any of this in
detail.  We are potentially exposed for Steve Jackson to hire some of these
players away.  Steve is going to have deliverables at his new employer, our
competitor, which will require that he have good people.  He will be moving
to Columbus, Ohio where he will not personally know anyone locally to hire.
He does know these risk specialists here, and being young and single or
childless, their mobility factors could be high.  Enron would not want to
lose any other talent to Steve's new employer.
