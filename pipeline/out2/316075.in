Janet has already signed Change Order #2, so adding value to this one will
required that change order #3 be revised, then we would have to go back to
ESA for their approval. It would be easier on this end if we could pick up
the new stuff in this one to a subsequent change order?
I spoke to Lee Johnson yesterday about all the change orders, and a couple of
outstanding issues.  I am having difficulty getting GE's attention on the
facility agreements, and would prefer that the change orders not be given to
GE until I at least get a call back on the issue.  If this is a problem,
please let me know.
