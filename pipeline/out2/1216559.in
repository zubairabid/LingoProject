I talked to Brian Whalen today.  He is trying to get an interconnection
agreement finalized to send to us tomorrow.  Sierra/Nevada have abandoned
their attempts to use the generation divestiture interconnection agreement
they sent us before and is falling back on their old interconnection
agreement, updated to reflect recent FERC orders.  Brian was very apologetic
about taking so long.

He said Sierra/Nevada is also attempting to comply with our request that they
send us a transmission agreement by the end of the month.

He asked me if we had gotten the Avery and Fischer reports (that would become
Appendices A-C to the interconnection agreement).  I said I didn't know but
that if he would E-mail them to me that I would make sure the appropriate
people got them.

Lysa- when I get these reports please forward them to Don.
