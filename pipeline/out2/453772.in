Steve -

As you requested, attached please find the Analyst compensation comparables
we discussed last week:



We are having an extremely tough time recruiting Analysts from Rice because
our main competition on campus comes from consulting companies (Bain,
McKinsey, BCG, EY, Andersen, etc.) and investment banks (Goldman, JP Morgan,
CSFB, Merrill Lynch, etc.).  Even though these companies are not directly in
our industry group, they are our principal competitors for talent at Rice.

As evidenced by our recruiting performance this year and in previous years,
we loose nearly every time when we compete with these companies.    In the
last three years of recruiting at Rice, only 1 or 2 people have accepted our
offer.  The other Analysts who are rice alumni (myself included) joined Enron
through other circumstances.

I think our poor performance at Rice is due primarily to the following
factors:

Compensation:  The Enron compensation package  is below that of our
competitors at Rice.  Additionally, there is more risk associated with our
offer, since Enron's compensation structure relies more heavily on the year
end bonus than some of our competitors.  In the cases where the package is
similar (ie, McKinsey), we loose folks because of other company's name and
prestige.
Rotations:  Most investment banks give their analysts offers to work in
specific groups (M&A, Trading, Etc.).  Our analyst recruits can express a
preference, but their placement is not guaranteed.    This also creates an
added element of risk and uncertainty.

In sum, I think we will continue to be unsuccessful in our recruiting efforts
at Rice if we do not address these issues.

Should you need any further information, please feel free to contact me.
