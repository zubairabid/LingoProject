Admittedly , ERCOT was handled poorly from a pleading submission perspective,
but there is a legitimate discussion going on within the company that , at
the very least,  will result in a more flexible approach to market structure
and , perhaps( this is my preference) will result in a sharpening and
refocusing of our positions that will acknowledge the necessity for an
"LMP"-like approach in real-time to achieve sufficient depth of liquidity.(
with a keen focus on developing forward markets in transmission rights).
Airing our differences and doubts externally creates absolutely no benefit -
At the end of the day, we're here ( no matter where we end up on this issue)
to enhance the company's commercial success, not to win an ideological
battle. I understand and value the passion people in our group bring to their
work... I don't want to lose that "fire", but merely want to assure that it
is properly directed. We will resolve this issue shortly and am quite  sure
we will all work hard to ensure uniformity of message at that time.
