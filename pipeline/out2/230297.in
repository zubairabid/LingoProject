This is a forward power contract.  It is actually a one-off contract so no
master agreement (and no CSA at least at the moment). It's an option
arrangement whereby we have an option for each of four years (years 2-5 of
the deal) to supply power at preagreed terms.  We pay the option premium
during year one by means of a rebate to the customer of a fixed % of their
electricity costs.
I guess we just have to include additional provisions to the agreement
covering the various credit issues which need to be dealt with, but I am not
quite sure where to start in a stand alone agreement situation.
Sorry about this.
Thanks.
Ps. We are under enormous pressure to get this deal done ASAP and in any case
by Christmas - this is the first forward power deal we will actually sign.
