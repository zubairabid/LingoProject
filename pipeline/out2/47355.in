After nearly a year of work, we now have a tool to show us the meaning behind
our  MW volume.

I would like to thank the following people for their help on this very
difficult project:

Glenn Anderson - for a multitude of Enpower coding, the lion's share of the
work on this project.
Murray O'Neill and Dave Poston - for their assistance and knowledge in
project management and "developer-speak".
Dan Maxwell - for creating the final VB tool that was the capstone of the
project.

Thank you all for your very hard work, we have a product to be proud of!
