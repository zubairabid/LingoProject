A quick download on our conference call:  We agreed to split the larger group
up into 3 working groups.  The 3 of us are in the southern group.  (I, for
one, would be happy if all future meetings were held in Mexico City or San
Francisco.)  By Feb 29, we are to circulate to the larger group a report on
existing commercial problems along the US/Mexico border, e. g. continuing
difficulties with El Paso Electric and moving power across the border, and
recommendations for their solution.  Those recommendations could be much
farther reaching than just a complaint action against the utility.

It is my impression that there could be significant opportunities if we could
move more power south across the border, but that there is real intransigence
on the part of the utilities on this side.  I have no idea what the situation
is on the other side of the border.

Why don't we trade emails and voicemails over the next few weeks and try to
schedule a conference call the week of Feb 14?  That will give us about 2
weeks to get a written report together and to follow up on our brilliant
discussions.   If you have a better idea, let me know.
