Steve, apparently I'm developing an overactive imagination when it comes to
FERC decisions.

In Panhandle Eastern Pipe Line Company, 74 FERC  61,102, reh'g denied, 75
FERC  61,272 (1996), and Transwestern, 90 FERC P 61,044, in which FERC
approved LFT services, the Commission accepted the pipelines' statements that
they would not sell capacity that is not available (i.e., will not
double-sell), rather than limit the service in some way or reject the filings.

In Iroquois Gas Transmission System, L.P., 79 FERC  61,394 (1997), the
Commission approved of the pipeline's selling of capacity that becomes
operationally available for various reasons from time to time.

But I have not been able to locate the general statement along the lines of
"pipelines can use their own discretion to determine whether capacity is
available" that I thought existed.
