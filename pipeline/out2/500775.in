If I am reading this correctly, it appears that rather than provide an
adjustment for decremental units relieving local congestion, they will be
required to either pay the market clearing price of energy for the zone or
redispatch another unit in the same zone to counter act the decremental
instruction.
I believe we can support this change as long as few questions are properly
handled:
If there are multiple units that can clear the local congestion problem, who
gets selected?  (best shift factor, submitted dec bids, ERCOT flips a coin?)
If a generator fails to follow this instruction will it properly show up as
an uninstructed deviation, or will ERCOT follow performance to these direct
instructions some other way?
Can this similar methodology be used on the incremental side to curb abuse
by those who manipulate their resource plans to create congestion they will
be the only resource to correct?
Have a great day!
