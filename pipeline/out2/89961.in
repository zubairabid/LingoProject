Matt just talked to his broker and verified the price at $260. If the back
office doesn't recognize this in the next couple minutes, tell them to TALK
to Rodney Drake, the Prebon broker who seemed to be quite sure that our price
was right. I'm sorry this is causing chaos on your end - but sometimes I
wonder if the brokers are communicating with people in their own office....?
