Sorry about that Edmund.  The forms have been moved out of the atty.fms bank
into their own subdirectory called "Swap Forms" (look it up just like a
person's named directory).   Let me know whether you can access that database
from London.  We had London set up to review the atty.fms bank only, I don't
know if you can access other subdirectories.
We have made some substantive revisions to the ISDA Schedule and Credit
Support Annex, so you might want to take a look.  If you can't do a
comparewrite from London, let me know and I'll email you the blacklined
forms.  We've also made changes to the forms of guarantees.  They are now
located in a document called Guaranty.doc in the Swap Forms/Current Forms
directory.
Also, the ISDA definitions have been changed since you've been gone, you may
already know that, but just in case...I thought I'd bring it up.
