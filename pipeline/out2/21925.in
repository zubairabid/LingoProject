Ken,



I have been watching a new company since April. The founder worked at
Insource Technology as a consultant for a while and is a good guy. The
service is explained in the executive summary attached, but in a nutshell
they solve the need for reliable information support for schools by getting
the server out of the schools and onto an Application Service Provider. The
result is much better information (attendance, grading, assignments,
messages, etc.) but the schools only need a simple computer with a browser to
access the service. If one computer breaks, they simply move to another
computer and access the service. This is the same concept as Questia, but
they can get by with much older computer technology, which is a big plus for
schools. Also, parents can access essentially real time information about
their child,s grades and attendance, and can easily communicate with the
teacher through the messaging.



When I met with them in April, I liked the idea but was consumed with
Questia. Since then, they have launched a beta test and then rolled out the
production version of the service in the DeSoto ISD. They trained over 200
teachers and have proven the simplicity and effectiveness of their system.
Lamar Consolidated ISD has requested that they rollout the service in three
test schools this fall. They also just hired a new CEO, Roland Rodriquez, to
lead the company, with the founder continuing to be involved.



They are trying to raise $3 million. John Chaney and I met with them Tuesday
morning and decided after the meeting that we were both interested in putting
around half a million in the company, and that we needed to get three or four
others to put in about the same amount. We are both willing to go on the
board, with one or two other new outside directors.



Ken, this is not in the same ballpark as Questia, but it is a very good idea
and I believe they can pull it off. Please let me know if you have any
questions and if you would like to have a meeting with them.



Rod
