Rich,
Thanks for the note.  If you guys are interested in doing this, I think our
next step is to give Citizens a ballpark estimate of what we would charge to
operate their Griffith system.  We can "hedge" our proposal based on the need
to see the installed equipment specs and/or what other equipment might be
necessary to integrate these facilities into our operations.  I'm awaiting
word from legal/regulatory to see what their issues might be.
