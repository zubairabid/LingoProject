The flight was uneventful, although I didn't sleep very much.  Weather here
is cold but clear, so I am enjoying it.  Very useful trip - they have my
schedule very full, including dinners every night.  I will be in the office
through end of day Thursday, and then dinner with Fernley Thursday night.  I
will be in route to Houston on Friday - catching a 9:00am flight (told the
kids that I would be at the airport at 2:00 am Houston time to start back
home).

We are not going to follow the Kean/Olson memo on communicating ratings.  We
will only communicate Needs Improvement and Issues.  There will be differing
messages for needs improvement which fit the situation - some need to hear
that they are not performing at a high enough level relative to peers to help
us achieve business goals or for them to considered for a bonus (may need to
find another role within or outside Enron which is a better fit).  Message to
someone new to Enron in that category should be different.  Glad they are
here; believe that as they learn the organization and their job that they
will be able to make significant contributions; doing the right thing to
learn the business, but that contributions to date are not significant enough
to warrant payment of a bonus...

Thanks for getting everyone on the same page on this.  --Sally
