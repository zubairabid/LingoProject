I have left you each a voice mail, but wanted to be sure to try to catch the
issue with you by email as well. We received a fax today at 3 with some
comments from K&E on the swaps.  Please note that we have processed most all
of the swaps and are now working on Merlin and Catalytica which are more
complex.  Julia Chin and I have reviewed the comments and feel that they are
not substantive and only reflect different wording styles.  At this juncture
we would request that you assess whether or not our time is well spent
reprocessing all of the swaps on the basis of the K&E comments.  Please
consider these matters as soon as you can obtain a copy of their mark-ups and
advise me.  In order that I be most productive I intend to continue my work
on the Merlin Credit Derivative while awaiting your direction on these other
nonsubstantive changes.  Therefore, the subject swaps will not now be
reprocessed.  Thank you.  Mary
