As Enron,s eCommerce businesses continue to grow, there is an increasing need
to develop support teams to manage the day to day operations of each business
unit.  The knowledge and experience of the EnronOnline team is an invaluable
asset that should be utilized as other eCommerce initiatives are launched.
With that in mind, we are pleased to announce the following organizational
changes within the EnronOnline Product Control Group effective immediately.

The EnronOnline team will be lead by Jennifer Denny.  She will be responsible
for the overall management of EnronOnline operations ) including Reporting,
Bridging, Customer Registration and Product Documentation.  The Reporting and
Bridging group will be managed by Torrey Moorer, the Customer Registration
group will be led by Lisa Lees, and the Documentation group will be the
responsibility of Rob Cass and Dale Neuner.  The Clickpaper Product Control
Group will be managed by Frank Davis, and the Commodity Logic and DealBench
operations will be led by Dale Neuner.  The Call Center will be integrated
into one eCommerce call center to support all four business units.  This
group will be the responsibility of Keith Clark.  Each of these teams will be
responsible for providing support to the Commercial teams, internal and
external customers, and the various back office functions.  Jennifer, Frank,
Dale and Keith will report to me.

The attached organizational chart outlines the new teams.  Please join me in
congratulating everyone on their new roles.

Thank you
Sheri Thomas
