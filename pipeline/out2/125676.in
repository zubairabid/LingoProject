Dan,
Today, I entered into some conversations with the City of Palo Alto regarding
fixing forward gas prices for them.  They have a copy of a Master agreement
and a copy of an ISDA which are currently in their legal department.  They
have requested a copy of the GTC language which would allow us to transact in
the immediate future, although I am still pushing for a Master.  They
currently have a Power Master in place with EPMI.
Could you forward a copy of the General Terms and Conditions to Monica
Padilla with the City of Palo Alto at Monica_Padilla@city.palo-alto.ca.us
first thing in the morning?  Please let me know if you have any questions or
issues.
Thanks,
Kim Ward
