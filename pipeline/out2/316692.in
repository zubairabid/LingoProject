Sean,
1.  On the signature lines for each document, please provide the role that
each party is signing as.  Also, Wilmington Trust is signing as Manager for
E-Next Generation LLC.
2.  Please obtain from Catherine Clark the extension and transfer documents
on the Blue Dog turbines.  In mid-November, the transaction with LJM was
extended and EECC assigned their option and agency role to ENA.
3.  I'll let the lawyers make their comments and direct you as to
distribution of these documents to both WestLB/counsel and TurboPark parties.
