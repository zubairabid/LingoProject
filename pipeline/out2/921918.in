It is hard for me to say how this would work on behalf of all of my direct
reports.  Sometimes it is tough to have all assistants out at once.  To meet
at 3:00, you all would have to leave around 2:30, which could be early in the
day for some groups to lose assistants.    Would it work to start a little
later in the afternoon?  If before 5:00, I think that all assistants will
have to check with their managers on the convenience of an earlier departure
time.  --Sally
