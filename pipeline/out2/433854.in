Arfan,

We need to discuss this before you send anything out.  I had an extensive
conversation today with Tana Jones in our Legal Department today.  She said
that it is up to the London Legal department (Justin Boyd in particular) to
set their own perameters with consultation with Houston Legal, and vice versa.

Those below are accurate, however, after speaking with Tana, the list below
may not be comprehensive.  She is recommending that you speak with Justin
Boyd.
I think we may be putting ourselves in the middle of something that the two
Legal groups should be discussing amongst themselves.

Please feel free to call me tomorrow.

Thanks.  Lisa
