NEWS FROM THE GLOBAL FLASH
EnPipe Services
The Continental Gas team is launching the first virtual gas transportation
product in Europe, EnPipe Services.  EnPipe will offer customers the ability
to swap gas between the NBP in the UK and the Zeebrugge Hub in Belgium.
Customers will be able to nominate volumes on a day-ahead basis, and will pay
for the service by an up-front premium.  This new service should encourage
more participants at the Zeebrugge Hub, which will lead into more liquidity
at other trading locations developing on the Continent.   Similar to the
virtual storage service, EnBank, EnPipe demonstrates Enron's ability to offer
valuable services to the market through smart risk management rather than
capital-intensive infrastructure.   The first EnPipe auction will close on 15
March, and customers may submit their bids on EnronOnline.
Teesside Gas Processing Plant
On Thursday, 1st March, the Teesside Gas Processing Plant achieved ISO
9001:2001Quality Management System Accreditation.  This achievement is the
result of 12 months hard work, enthusiasm and commitment by all plant staff
and has also been a great team effort with the Enron Global Asset
Organisation providing technical and moral support.
An ISO Team was formed in February 2000 led by Iris Thomas (QA Coordinator)
and supported by members from all site disciplines including Operations,
Maintenance, Accounts and IT.  A program was implemented to prepare, write,
issue and control, detailed procedures to ensure the plant was operated and
maintained to the quality standards required by ISO 9001:2001.  Customer
satisfaction and focus is an integral part of the standard and a great deal
of effort has been put into this area.  Following a pre-audit in January the
final accreditation audit commenced on Wednesday, 28th February, with
accreditation being confirmed on Thursday, 1st March.
