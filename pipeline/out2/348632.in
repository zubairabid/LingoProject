Steve,

I am very happy for Mexico.  There is no perfect candidate, nevertheless the
positive impact of finally having a change in the party in power after 71
years is beyond our forecast ability.  At last,  we are going to have more
checks and balances in the system with all the benefits that they will bring
to the country  to a more democratic way of doing things.  Also with the
checks and balances everybody will have to listen, respect and negotiate with
others.  It's going to be fun.

For us it means:

1.  A couple of weeks ago I had a meeting with a key Fox advisor and we will
have the opportunity to participate in the design of their energy policies,
and as you remember,last year I worked closely with a group of PAN
legislators (close to Fox) in helping them draft aan alternative proposal for
the reform of the electric sector.
2. The unions did not vote for the PAN and they are the main stronghold
against energy reform.  The PAN has no compromise with the unions.
3.  Industrials have backed the PAN and since yesterday energy reform has
been on Fox's agenda.  He said he would not sell assets but that he would
open the industry to private investment.  You have to start somewhere.
4. We should work very hard this summer and try to participate in the
2000-2006 National Development Plan which is a government plan that the new
administration is obligated by law  to create and publicize.  I will offer
100% of my time to help them develop the energy part tof the plan.
5.  There are rumors that our friend Luis Tellez is staying as well as some
of his undersectretaries.  Hopefully Hector Olea will stay at the CRE as well.
6.  In the medium term we could see lower interest rates for the Mexican
economy.  Since Sunday they are down more than 3 percentage points to around
14.7%.  Hopefully in a couple of yeares we should be well below the 10% mark
(depending also on the U.S. rates)

In short,  all is well south of your border.  The long transition to
democracy is over.

Best,

Ricardo
