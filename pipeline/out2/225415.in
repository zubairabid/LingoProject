I still can't talk.  I think that our response should be final except that
there may be some agreed to changes on the L/C side.  Carol St. Clair is
addressing that with Jennifer and Miriam.  In any event, I believe that Tiger
needs to "OK" our response of yesterday since there were some errors on their
redraft.  Marie is not in the office today.  If you want to speak to a
person, call Susan Bailey and she can come into my office and we can manage.
Have a good weekend.  Sara
