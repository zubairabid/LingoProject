Okay, I wasn't sure who to route this to, but one of our traders gave Claire
Neri at UGI my name and number to help with information about our contracts.
As it turns out, we do not have a Master Contract with UGI but have a firm
term deal  attached to a GTC (Deal #345010, running from 11/1/00 - 3/31/01,
5380 MMBTu/day @ $4.78, meter #103702 on ANR).
UGI's hope is to get a Master agreement in place ASAP to cover the above
mentioned deal & any new inter gas deals (since she sent their master, I'm
assuming that their intent is to put their master in place ASAP). Claire Neri
can be reached at 610-796-3505 for additional information of
changes/negotiations.
Note: UGI is also an EOL "Investment Grade" counterparty for non-Texas natual
gas.
