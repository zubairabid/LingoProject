I have asked Kaye for copies of the CA's referred to.  I agree completely re:
the need for a procedure.  Let me know what you think about the following:
1. Commercial team identifies the proposed reference entity (RE) and forwards
the name to Credit.  At the same time, the commercial team should be
identifying any Enron relationship with the proposed RE and discussing the
proposal with the appropriate relationship head(s).
2. Credit reviews the proposed RE and approves or rejects (so far there have
been many rejections so this makes sense as a next cut).  If approved, Credit
notifies the commercial team which then forwards the approval to Legal
together with the results of their investigations regarding other Enron
relationships.
3. Legal conducts a "screening" Confidentiality Agreement review locally and
forwards the name to the other Enron legal groups for similar review.   If
the screen reveals confidentiality agreements with the RE or any of its
affiliates, the commercial team should be consulted to determine the
appropriate level of further review.  If the commercial team considers the RE
the subject of legitimate transactional interest, detailed review of the
confidentiality agreements and their impact may be appropriate.  In addition,
if the confidentiality agreement screens are passed, Legal should analyze the
"other Enron relationships" to determine if they raise any legal concerns.
Upon final approval, Legal notifies the commercial team (copying Credit).
Something this involved may make sense only for RE's that will be offered on
the website.  Perhaps a streamlined version would suffice for RE's only
offered pursuant to an unsolicited request.
