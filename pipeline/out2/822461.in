Dear Managers & Supervisors,
Thank you for your participation and contributions to the Year End 2000 PRC
process.    It was a privilege for me to witness all of you making decisions
that were beneficial to Enron and the development of the employees that you
supervise.    Now what remains to be done is to give your employees their
feedback verbally and in written form.
I encourage all of you to complete your employee's evaluations before bonuses
and merit increases are given on 2/5/01.
Please remember:
All employees in non-bonusable categories must have their performance
evaluations reviewed by HR and Legal before the evaluation is presented to
the employee.
Rankings will remain confidential and will not be communicated to employees.
HR will participate as observers of some reviews.
Let us know how we can assist you,
Your HR Team
