Hey:
Haven't had the best of months.  Like you had some good positions but others
wiped out everything.  Unbelievable how the whole curve moves as one for 6
months and then separates completely.  The z/f/g and f/g/h flies are
amazing.  Something definitely out of whack.  Hard to believe cash in Z will
be cantango to F and front spread, F/G, will be 40.  Spreads definitely
implying we will see some $10+ prints on daily cash at the hub this winter.
Hell, already seeing it in the West.  The system is just broken there.
interesting to see if it is a sign of what can come in the east later.
definitely more flexibility in the east so the blowouts won't occur until
latter part of the winter.   the inelasticity of demand continues to be
unbelievable.  who would have thunk it.   Gas can be 3 times what it was one
year ago and not a significant loss of demand.
market definitely trained to buy the dips at this point.  continues to be a
very trending market.  most days finish on the intraday high or low.
Pira told the boys to hedge jv and cal 2 and the impact has been
significant.  i quote bids on term strips 5 times a day.   understand they
are changing their view somewhat tomorrow.  wait and see if it relieves some
back pressure.  very surprised at lack of spec long interest in jv at 4.5
considering the scenario that's being painted.
