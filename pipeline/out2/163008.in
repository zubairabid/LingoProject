Sue:
To follow up from yesterdays' call with us, we are going to revise the
California ETI tariff(s) to parallel your national Enron template. We are
also looking at Pacific Bell's Tariff CAL. PUC No. 175T to determine their
current Dedicated Transport service tariffed rates, and will advise.
We have a PDF version of the Master Sales Agreement, and are incorporating
some minor revisions - and maintaining the Contract as governing over the
tariff. I believe we also needed input from Enron Broadband Sales on the
California customer Forms for filing with the updated tariffs.
If you could pass along the template so we can change the services, that
would be greatly appreciated. Please let us know any questions,
