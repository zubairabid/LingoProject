Hi there,
I made some revisions to the language Rose proposed.
Here are some questions/comments:
I deleted the references to changing any delegation of rights/obligations.
I'm not yet clear as to what the agency language will look like, and what
rights we need/want to change (i) the identity of the agent (ii) the role of
the agent (iii) whether the agency can be terminated.  I'm just not that
familiar with the structure yet, but if I can get that information, I'll work
on it.
I suggest we consider using a credit rating instead of "substantially
similiar" comparison.  Just easier to decipher.
Rose/Lisa, I've added some SPV language.
I'm added receipt of final payment as an exception to the credit rating
standard.  In other words, if they have received their final payment, they
can't use credit as a reason to not give consent.
I don't think we should agree to provide a list of power projects done by the
assignee in the past 5 years.  I also think 3 years is a bit much on audited
financials, but I didn't comment there.
I don't like their language that an affiliate must be intending to
own/operate the plant.  I've just bracketed the langauge and added
"construct", since I don't know if this point has already been agreed.
Enough explanation, here it is (with Word file attached below):
Except for as described in Section ___ [ next paragraph], neither Party shall
assign any or all of their duties or rights under this Contract without prior
written consent from the other Party; such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.
Notwithstanding the foregoing:  (i) either Party [Agent, too?] may assign any
or all of its duties or rights to any Affiliate or subsidiary without the
other Party,s consent; (ii) Purchaser may assign any or all of its duties or
rights to any Affiliate of Enron Corp., without Seller,s consent, [provided
that such assignee shall construct, own or operate the [Units] for the
purpose of generating electric power for revenue], and (iii) Purchaser may
assign any or all of its rights and obligations without Seller,s consent
following [delivery/substantial completion?].  In each instance the
assignment shall be effective as of the time the assignor delivers notice to
the other party in accordance with [Section ]. [form to be agreed now?]
Seller shall only be deemed to be reasonable in withholding its consent if
the proposed assignee: (i) does not have [a credit rating of ___]
[substantially the same or better credit quality than Agent] unless (a) the
proposed assignee provides appropriate guaranties, letters of credit or other
assurances of payment issued by an entity or person with [a credit rating of
___] [substantially the same or better credit quality than Agent], or (b) the
assignor agrees to remain liable for all liability under this Agreement until
[delivery/substantial completion], or (c) is a party participating in or
providing financing or financing structures, including, without limitation,
structures related to leasing arrangements and project financing, including a
special purpose vehicle receiving financing to develop and/or construct the
project for which Purchaser [or Agent] purchased the Equipment [add
requirement of  delivery of  &rep letter8 from Enron regarding financing
sufficiency], or (d) final payment (except for the retention amount) has been
made to Seller;  (ii) is a direct competitor of Seller in the turbine
manufacturing business, (iii) is an adverse party to Seller in any material
litigation, or (iv) if purchasing the Equipment, such assignee is not
purchasing such Equipment (or rights thereto) as part of a transaction in
which Purchaser, Agent or their Affiliates is providing related goods and/or
services to such assignee.
Purchaser or Agent shall have the right to assign or pledge, from time to
time, all or any portion of their respective right, title and interest in, to
and under the Agreement as collateral for financing of this Facility without
Seller,s consent.
In the instances where consent is required, the party requesting consent
shall request such consent in writing, including the following:
(a) the legal name and address and the form and place of incorporation or
organization of the proposed assignee;
(b) the current published annual report of the proposed assignee, or if no
such report is published three years of audited financial statements and a
description of the proposed assignee,s business, if available; and
(c) [a descriptive list of power generation projects completed by the
assignee during the preceding five years].
Seller shall respond to any request for consent within thirty (30) days
following its receipt of such request.   Seller,s consent if granted shall be
in the form of Appendix __ hereto.  Any failure to respond in writing within
the foregoing period shall be deemed to constitute consent.
When duly assigned in accordance with this Article, (including, following any
collateral assignment, upon foreclosure by any collateral assignee), (i) this
Agreement or the rights and/or obligations so assigned shall be binding upon
and shall inure to the benefit of the assignee (and all rights and/or
obligations so assigned, including, without limitation, any and all warranty
rights, shall be assigned to the assignee as if such assignee were an
original party hereto), (ii) the assignor shall be irrevocably relieved of
and forever discharged from all liability under this Agreement so long as the
assignee executes an assumption of this Agreement and such liabilities and
obligations herein, and (iii) Seller shall look only to such assignee for the
performance of the obligations so assigned.  Any assignment other than as
permitted herein shall be void and without force or effect.
