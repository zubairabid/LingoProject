We can continue the discussion in Tuesday's conference call, but I discussed
with Ben about the issues below, and here are some thoughts.  This is NOT a
complete approach, but only a starting point for discussion.
The main task is to build a pricing system for many names.
This has two components ---
1) How to price a single name?
1.1) How to price a liquid single name?
1.2) How to price an illiquid single name?
2) How to efficiently apply the methodology to multiple names?
The approach I would take for 1.1 is
a) Define a small set of liquid names
b) Apply each of the different models we have, say, the six models Ben has
mentioned below, to these names
c) Include market prices, if any, for these names
d) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each liquid name should
price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b) and (c)
e) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion
of the trader prices across the models
f) Quantify these attributes, if possible
g) Try a different set of liquid names and repeat the process, and see if the
decisions in the last round still make sense
The approach for 1.2 may be
a) Define a small set of illiquid names
b) Apply each of the different models we have to these names
c) Sit with traders, get trader's intuition on where each illiquid name
should price and note this on the spectrum of prices obtained in (b)
d) Try to determine attributes of the names that may explain the dispersion
of the trader prices across the models
e) Check if these are similar to the attributes identified for liquid names
f)  Define a master set of liquid names
g) Look for relationships (by analyzing cross-section of data) between
attributes or prices of illiquid names to those of liquid names
Once a mapping has been defined for an illiquid name to a set of liquid names
and their attributes, then this mapping can be entered into a table, and the
pricing can be automated for all names (IN THEORY)!  The success will depend
on the success of the round-table sessions for the approaches for 1.1 and
1.2.
Building a new fundamental model is always a worthwhile task, but we can get
going with the above approaches immediately in parallel with developing any
new models that we may build.  New models can be added to the suite of
existing models. I do not believe there will ever be a single model that will
answer all questions for all names, but rather we can refine the mappings and
relative choices among models over time, which would mean continuing
round-table sessions with traders.  Limited data makes calibration very hard,
so I would continually ask the question "What do we calibrate?" throughout
the discussions for 1.1 and 1.2, and this may help guide us to new models.
