pull out your settlement matrix and see if this SA agrees with that
document.  I don't necessarily think it does.  Didn't we basically agree to
disagree and/or deal with this issue outside the settlement process?  Are you
saying that Edison can reserve capacity in the same manner as Core and 50% of
noncore, but at the approx. 7.9 cent rate?
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.... is this language saying that they can convert the
VALUE of their capacity rights to a capacity contract at the point?  For
example, if Edison has 200/d at 1 cent Wheeler access fee, they could conver
it to approx. 25/d at the full 7.9 cent rate?
Let's get clarification!!!
