The French government made fuel-tax concessions to pressure groups, including
lorry owners and farmers, who had brought much of the country to a standstill
by blockading roads and petrol stations. The cave-in inspired copycat
protests across much of the European Union.

British protesters, following the French example, blockaded refineries and
all but halted fuel deliveries throughout the country. As petrol ran out,
Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, ruled out immediate concessions to the
protesters. His early efforts to get fuel deliveries resumed were largely
unsuccessful, but in response to appeals by Mr Blair and others, protesters
started to lift the blockades.

scratch.

More than 2,000 protesters against globalisation disrupted the World Economic

Malaysian resort.
