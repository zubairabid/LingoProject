Sweet deals

General Electric, an American conglomerate, announced a friendly takeover of
another American giant, Honeywell International, that will be worth $43
billion. The merger heads off a bid by United Technologies, an aerospace and
appliance firm that hoped to boost its business in aircraft engines. GE chief
Jack Welch, who had been scheduled to retire next April, will stay until the
end of 2001 to oversee the merging of the companies.

Boosting its retail banking business in Europe, Deutsche Bank will buy the
banking operations of France,s Banque Worms for an undisclosed sum. The
French bank, now owned by an insurance behemoth, AXA, has roughly 15,000
retail clients. AXA will retain a third of Worms,s assets, including
divisions involved in trading securities.

The fight between Repsol YPF, a Spanish energy concern, and Endesa, Spain,s
leading electricity provider, for the second-biggest generator, Iberdrola,
has ended in a government-sanctioned settlement. Endesa will buy Iberdrola on
condition that both firms sell generating assets to Repsol. The Spanish
government, once the owner of both Repsol and Endesa, maintains veto power
over acquisitions by both companies.

Cost cuts are coming to Xerox. The copier maker intends to lop $1 billion off
its expenses next year in a battle against losses. Plans to sell assets worth
between $2 billion and $4 billion, including all of its divisions in China,
are also in the works. The extra cash will help to pay off Xerox,s recently
incurred bank debts.

The Barings name, trusted in investment banking for centuries before being
tainted by speculative losses in the 1990s, is set to disappear altogether.
Dutch parent ING, a financial-services group, announced the change as part of
a strategy to promote its own brand worldwide. Barings is likely to be
renamed ING Investment Banking Services.

Hold the phone

America,s telecoms giant, AT&T, will be split into four separate companies
dealing, respectively, with broadband applications, wireless, consumer
services and business services, in a bid to enhance shareholder value; AT&T,s
shares had lost 54% this year. The new plan represents an about-turn after
three years of buying small companies worth a total of $100 billion.

Italy,s auction of third-generation wireless licences netted only 26.8
trillion lire ($11.6 billion), with the five bidders*Omnitel Pronto Italia,
IPSE, Wind, Andala and Telecom Italia Mobile*each offering about the same
bid. Following through on an earlier threat, investors in Blu, a consortium
partially owned by BT, scuttled the firm,s attempt to garner a licence.
Stakeholders are now trying to recoup their deposit of 4 trillion lire, which
was frozen by the Italian government after Blu,s withdrawal.

Potentially anti-competitive activities at NTT, the Japanese telecoms
monopoly, have attracted the attention of Japan,s Fair Trade Commission. The
regulator is investigating whether NTT tampered with other companies,
attempts to provide digital subscriber line (DSL) services. NTT,s control of
local telephone lines allegedly allowed it to delay competitors,
installations of DSL equipment.

Financial regulators in America and Britain took steps to end companies,
selective disclosure of information to favoured analysts and fund managers,
rather than all investors at the same time.

Euro furrow

The euro again plumbed new depths this week, touching 82.3 cents at one
point. In the meantime, members of the European Parliament blasted the ruling
council of the European Monetary Institute, the European Central Bank,s
predecessor, for shelling out huge bonuses to ECB staff before the common
currency,s introduction. The payments amounted to more than double what ECB
rules supposedly allow.

Six economic research institutes predicted lower growth for Germany and the
euro zone than previously expected. They forecast that the German economy
would grow by only 2.7% next year, revised downwards from their April guess
of 2.8% and well below the International Monetary Fund,s estimate of 3.3%.
Higher oil prices were partly responsible for the lower forecast.

Japan has changed its accounting system for national income, with the
probable result that GDP figures for 1997 and 1998 will be revised upwards
substantially. Investment in information technology had been omitted from the
totals until this year. Under the new system, Japan,s 1.9% contraction in
1998 could magically shrink to only 0.7%.

Changes afoot

The chairman and CEO of Lucent Technologies, Richard McGinn, saw his tenure
end unexpectedly early. Two weeks after declaring his intent to stay with the
company, Mr McGinn was sacked by a hostile board. The move followed a 10%
drop on last year in Lucent,s annual profits.

ABB, a leading engineering firm, has lost its chief executive. After 30 years
with the company and four years in the top job, G"ran Lindahl stepped down in
the wake of poor third-quarter figures, saying it was time to hand it over
&to a younger leader with a true IT profile8. His successor will be J"rgen
Centerman, head of ABB,s automation division.

For the first time, investors will be able to buy future contracts for fine
wines. Euronext, an umbrella group for commodity exchanges in Belgium, France
and the Netherlands, will introduce futures for up to 141 Bordeaux vintages
on Paris,s Matif market by early 2001. Italian wines are to be securitised in
Milan six months later.
