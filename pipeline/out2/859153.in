If you would like for me to send cards to your customers, please provide me
with a list of their names and addresses by next Friday, 11/17.  I will get
the amount of cards as per however many customer names I am given.  I will
then have everyone sign one card so that I can send it out to get the
signatures lasered on the customer's cards.  I've already spoken with the
others on the desk, and they either aren't interested or they've gotten their
primary assistants to take care of it.

Elsa, as we've previously discussed, I can use the list that we just recently
updated.  Please let me know if you are going to select people from that
list, or if you are just going to send a card to everybody on it.

Thanks guys,
Laura
