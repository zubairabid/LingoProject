I am aware, per correspondence with Chris Foster,  that you will begin
reviewing the Smurfit-Stone Standard Contract in the very  near future.
Chris has probably already forwarded contract number SES0010  to your
attention via email. Please discard this contract. Since  this document
(SES0010) was created and forwarded to Chris, Smurfit-Stone has  made several
minor revisions to their standard contract. Therefore, I have  attached a
revised version for your review (SES0020). I look forward to  hearing back
from you in the very near future. OnceI have received  the okay from you, I
will forwardtwo original copiesin the mail for  signature. Thank you for
your assistance!
