Amy and Alec are definitely welcome!  Actually we had already planned on Amy
and Alec coming and a couple who we are friends with is bringing their
daughter, our flower girl, who is about 4 years old.  We have a whole room to
ourselves at the restaurant so Amy and Alec should be fine.  I talked to
grandma and she said Julie wouldn't be able to make it so I already knew
about that.  Don't worry about having 4 more people, the only reason we were
cautious about inviting aunts and uncles was we didn't want to open up the
flood gates but most of them already live in Houston or aren't going to make
it to Houston until late Friday.  As far as the bill just let me know what
you are comfortable with and we will pick up the rest.  The food bill with
tax and tip will be about $1,350.  We are very appreciative to have both our
parent's help as we quickly found that weddings are very expensive.  However,
we are both adults with good careers and try to be very self-sufficient.
Also, we realize that some things we do seem extravagant by our parents
standards.  We could have just as easily had a rehearsal at a Mexican
restaurant and it would have been cheaper - however we would rather have
things a certain way and pay for the difference.  Also, I know that you guys
are on a tight budget with the building of your house.  The bottom line is
that we are grateful for any help we receive and have the resources to pay
the balance.  Our most  important concern is that all our family and friends
to have a great time.  While I am on the subject, I hope your mother and
grandma Ina aren't going to get their feeling hurt about people drinking wine
at the dinner.  If you think they will please mention it to them on the way
down because I don't want them to be offended but I can't change who Zooey
and I are.  Just so you know we will have dinner and desert and then there
will be several toasts starting with the best man (James Cook) and the matron
of honor (Amber) and then probably ending in Zooey and me doing a quick
toast.  We would love for all our family to be there but if grandmother or
Betty Joyce is going to get offended and don't want to stay I understand.
Also, do you know if Skipper is planning to attend.  We haven't received a
reply card as to whether he will be there or not.  As to this weekend, I am
going to try to stop by but don't have a car so just depends what is going
on.  I will be in Dallas so if Mark is coming over Saturday afternoon I could
get a ride from him.  I'll try to talk to him and see if that works.
Finally, we are both really looking forward to our big day and are very glad
to have all our family there to support us!  If you have any questions please
call me tonight at the house.
