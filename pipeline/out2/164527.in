This project, of all that have been proposed recently, probably has a better
chance of success.  First, Mission Energy is already a huge player in the
IPP/Cogen business in Kern County, and is regarded as fairly skilled at
getting permits/authorizations through the system.  Their existing facilites
on Texaco's leases currently produce over 1,000 MW of power.  Secondly, this
project would sit smack dab in the middle of the Midway-Sunset field and is
easily accessible off the West Side Lateral of Kern/Mojave's system.  As
such, they are probably a prime candidate for either Phase I or Phase II of
Kern River's expansion.  Also, realize that Texaco has a substantial amount
of field area [associated oil] gas, so, depending on the structure of the
Texaco - Mission Energy sales agreement, Mission probably has access to or
call on this Texaco production (i.e., they have the perfect physical hedge).

Kern would seem to be the "pipeline of choice" here... particularly, when you
consider the impact of the reduced rates under their proposed expansion.
Without the direct connection into Kern County, TW would have a difficult
time competing.   Also, keep an eye out for El Paso moving forward with
commercial plans for the California leg of All American Pipeline.  A large
end-use plant like this could be the basis for an "En-Rate" type transport
program on El Paso-All American, particularly if they get their allocation
problems resolved at FERC.
