They will be doing a lot of  maintenance activity at the plant this month.
Unfortunately, much of the key material needed to do the full turnaround
needs several months lead time.  For example, we have already ordered the
catalyst for the turnaround scheduled in March.  We discussed this yesterday
with David Bush, the plant manager, and he said they would do what they could
in December, but the critical path items would not be available until closer
to March.

The MTBE plant will be going down December 15th and the maintenance (spooge
clean up) has been accelerated so we can come back up in Mid January to take
advantage of an expected increase in MTBE margins.

As far as longer term shut down considerations go, no one seems to have a
good grasp on what the methanol market will do.  Obviously, domestic
production will be curtailed which should lift prices.  If prices rise and
January gas prices fall back below $6.00, then we would probably come back up
in January.  Regarding staffing effort, particularly in my group, the
shutdown does not significantly impact the accountants and with a high
vacation time and year-end coming up, their plates are pretty full.  At the
plant, the purchasers, contract administrator and A/P folks will actually be
busier trying to get materials  and contracts for both outages settled,
especially with the timing change for the MTBE outage.

Let me know if you want to discuss this further.
