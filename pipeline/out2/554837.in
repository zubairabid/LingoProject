Hi

I'm sorry we missed you at the Christmas Party.  My wife and daughter had
tickets to a Christmas Play that conflicted, otherwise it would have been
nice to see everyone.  Things are fine with me, though big changes are in
store.  I'm really worried about Peter and Brian because they have not heard
anything yet from anyone about what their role will be.  I should have more
to say about my situation by tomorrow afternoon.

Cheers
