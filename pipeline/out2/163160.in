I have not yet seen this pleading, but it points out the need for us to file
our White Paper ASAP, today or tomorrow at the latest.  If time permits, it
may be helpful to briefly massage what has already been drafted for the White
Paper to specifically respond to the core economic point(s) made in the
SCE/PG&E/ISO/PX/TURN joint filing.

Finally, I strongly recommend that EPMI issue a press release and do as much
as possible to publicize our filing concurrent with when we make it,
emphasizing that the problems in California are caused by California's market
structure, that the only solution is to fix that structure, and that price
caps will only exacerbate the existing problem.  It would also be helpful if
some of our erstwhile generator/marketer compatriots would file in support of
the White Paper.  We need to neutralize the PR campaign that the UDCs and
California officials have been waging on behalf of their view related to the
need for lower and lower price caps.  Sue/Mary/Jeff: Can you arrange to have
EPMI's PR apparatus in gear, and lobby with WPTF members etc. for support?

Nancy:  Please get me a copy of the filing and fax a copy to Mary, Sue/Carl,
Jeff and Seabron ASAP.  (Jeff: Is your fax number the same as Sue's?)  Thanks.
