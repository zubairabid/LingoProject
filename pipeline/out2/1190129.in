We may have a problem with adding our own time stamp.  First, I believe our
agreement with Reuters limits our ability to modify their content and
restricts what we can say about the current nature of the quotes (they are
time delayed) and second, we don't want our time stamp to make people believe
that the quote was even current as of that time - since it won't be.  It
might be ok to have the entire quotes section headed by a line indicating
when it was last refreshed.  Many sites providing quotes like this have a
line (usually towards the bottom) indicating the delay period and most people
using those sites know they have to refresh their screen to update them.
Jason Peters is the expert on the terms of that agreement, so if you still
feel like you need to add something you might check with him.
