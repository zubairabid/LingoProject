Sara, This deal was binding from day one.  EWEB did say that they had
authority to enter into this transaction and thought they had the necessary
approvals from their board, therefore putting this language in the confirm is
alarming to me, maybe the better option may be to switch the deal to physical
if there is any issue with the financial.  Chistian Yoder was okay with their
authority to do this physically.  This deal is deep in the money for us now.
