The 2000 Chairman's Award nomination process was a tremendous success!  From
around the world, over 425 nominations were received representing a broad
cross-section of our overall organization and resulting in a 73% increase in
nomination participation from last year.  This 100% employee-driven program
is so successful because you take time to nominate and recognize those
individuals that are special in your work life.  Every single candidate is to
be congratulated!

This year, the original concept was brought to fruition when the members of
the 1999 Chairman's Roundtable took over the selection process and carried
the torch from past to present.  This Selection Committee reviewed all
candidates on the basis of their ability to consistently bring our values to
life and sought out those select few that are Enron's "everyday heroes".

It is with great pleasure that we announce the 2000 Chairman's Roundtable
whose daily pursuit of excellence, commitment to communication, genuine
integrity and respect for others are what make Enron the incredible company
that it is today - innovative, successful and undoubtedly one of the best
places to work.  The eleven individuals named below are flying to San Antonio
this from around the world to be honored at our annual Management
Conference.  One of these finalist will receive the distinguished recognition
as the actual Chairman's Award winner:
