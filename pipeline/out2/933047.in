FYI - Despite the fact that this an OU student, I thought that you would find
this note interesting.  Since we compete with Big 5 for talent at several
schools, we should be aware of the make up of some of their job offers that
lure students to join them.    Paying for a masters degree at UVA ahead of
time is certainly an interesting piece of this job offer.  See note from Lexi
below.
