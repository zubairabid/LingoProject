Please contact Stinson Gibner (VP), Vince Kaminski (MD of Enron Research) or
one their technical staff who did the model development: Samer Takriti or
Chonawee Supatgiat.  As I mentioned in our meeting, Enron Research is staffed
with some of the best risk model developers and EBS has engaged them to
develop optimization tools for trading and customer pricing activities.  Phil
Markwart has been our optical engineering expert who helped specify the
requirements for the research group.

Ravi.

p.s. for those who don't know Dan, he is part of the team (Dan please correct
me if I am wrong here!) that will be responsible for developing a trading
system for Bandwidth trading org. He has also began to look at the
optimization needs of the system.
