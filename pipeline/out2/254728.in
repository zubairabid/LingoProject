In the executive committee meeting today, the EOTT Board strongly emphasized
that they want us to vigorously pursue
criminal prosecution through V&E.  They also said the V&E attorneys you are
working with are brilliant, but they are "not mean enough".  They
specifically mentioned John Holsted of V&E, who "looks mean and is mean as a
junk yard dog".

John Duncan lamented that one of his former business partners, Steve Cook,
had committed criminal activities relative
to their business partnership.  But even with "plenty of hard evidence
against COOK' he was not successfully prosecuted
because the prosecutors found more interesting things to work on.

I assured our Board that you will stay on top of this case and press hard for
several years of prison time and hopefully
get a public flogging as well.
