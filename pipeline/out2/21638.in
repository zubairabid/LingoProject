I would like to schedule a short meeting in your office to  share the
remarkable progress that the Committee to Encourage Corporate  Philanthropy
is making and to ask that you consider hosting a meeting for  ten to fifteen
CEOs of other major Houston corporations to encourage their  participation in
the only forum of CEOs focused on the agenda of corporate  giving.

I'm anxious to meet you as we have so many friends in  common: three of your
directors, John Duncan, Pug Winokur and Norm Blake, and  the Slocums, to name
just a few.

I look forward to hearing from you.


P.S. If it works in your schedule, I'm available to come  to Houston on
August 28 or 29 or anytime the week of September  4.
