Gabriel,

I'm not sure if Binh sent an email to you and to Controls to explain the
Canadian origination variance.  You may already be aware, but on the Orig
Sched the originations are converted to $US using the spot rate for the day.
However when the originations are calculated for the Report tab the rate
applied is the average rate for the month.  Therefore these values will never
be the same.  Nicole is going to talk to Kathy when she gets back to Canada
on Monday.  Nicole says she has found a way to modify their spreadsheet so
that both values are calculated using the daily spot rate.   If you haven't
recieved an email from Binh explaining this issue you might want to forward
the attached message from Nicole to Michael and Chris.

Thanks,
Robin

PS The Bench by trader tied out for the 23rd.  I'll be in a little early
tomorrow to tie it out for the 24th.  Bye.
