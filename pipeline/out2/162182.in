The meeting went well. There was a lot of discussion regarding the current
deals involving the env. market.  ENA global markets presented their strategy
on trading/marketing emissions as well as compliance outsourcing
(comprehensive services related to emissions reductions.); EES talked about
capturing bypassed emissions from current bundled deals as well as the
challenges of doing retail in states w/ varying mandates & reporting
requirements; EES (Bruce Stram) talked a bit about dg;  ENA origination
talked about a massive fuel cell project they are working on (they are
keeping it confidential currently); ENA West Structuring talked about
financial packages to offset intermittent risk assc. w/ wind; Michael Payne
EWC talked about wind development in the states and the associated
opportunities w/ renewable energy credits; New Power talked a bit about their
rollout in NJ, PA and upcoming CA.  New Power is at a point where they need
to get up on the curve w/ regard to renewable mandates and reporting
standards.
Everyone seemed to agree that it makes sense for environmental strategies to
act as the "link" between the groups w/ regard to env. market opportunities.
There are considerable synergies involved w/ ee, renewables, air emissions
and technology control, and as we interface across the commercial groups,
ensure that the left hand is talking to the right (i.e. the deals are
capturing the most value and groups are aware of what others are working
on.)  We are rolling out an intranet page where we intend to offer business
intelligence and env. regulation info.  In the near term, I'll be circulating
the presentations and the contact list.  There will be some sort of follow up
meeting that is structured completely differently than this one.
