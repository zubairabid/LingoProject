One of the things that came out of the meeting I was at on Saturday with the
UC economists (including Tyson and Yellen) was a "manifesto" that they
published today (I'll have the final to distribute soon).  They're having a
press conference in about 10 minutes at Berkeley.  In anticipation, they're
quoted in a story in today's LA Times (that features Greenspan's comments)
and they focus their quotes on the need to raise rates.  Most of these folks
in the group, lamentably, earn their living by consulting for incumbents, but
there message here should be helpful, and there are a few "right-minded"
economists in the bunch.  (I managed to get Dr. Michaels in the group, who
was a great voice of reason in the debate over what to say in the manifesto.)
It wasn't appropriate for me to play a visible role in the design of the
manifesto, though I attempted to offer some behind the scenes suggestions.
