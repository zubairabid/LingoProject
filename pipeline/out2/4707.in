I'm in one piece; oblivious (if not for the news) of the bombs going off
all around me.  There's close to 15 million people here, so it should
take a while for them to get to me if they go at 13 people increments.

Inappropriate joking aside, what an awful thing.  I wonder at the
strange sort of logic that compels the bastards.  I hope they met as
grisly an end as the ones their handing out.

Did you get my picture?  Looking forward to the basket of goodies.  I
have a mailbox now, so letters should be more secure.

Thanks for the note.  Hope all is well.
