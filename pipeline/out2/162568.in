On Thursday, September 27th the ISO conducted a conference call to discuss the
status of the launch of their Inter-SC software upgrade.  During the call
several  SCs requested an extension of the market simulation to include the
week
of October 2nd.   The PX will in turn extend our market simulation for the
entire week of October 2nd using the following schedule:


(See attached file: Stage 6.7 Extended Mkt Sim Schedule.doc)

The ISO has scheduled a follow-up call on Wednesday, October 4th to discuss
the
readiness of their software and to determine a comfort level from its
customers
regarding a launch date for the software upgrade.   Currently the ISO is
working
toward a launch the week of October 23rd.

We will provide an update after Wednesday's call.

We will NOT have a PX call on Wednesday, calls will resume on Thursday,
October
5th.

Thank you.
