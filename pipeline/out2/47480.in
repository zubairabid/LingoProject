BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS

Global Risk Management Operations
Operational Risk Management was the topic of an information session held last
week for all managers and above in ENW who support trading operations for EA,
EIM and EGM in Houston, Portland and Calgary.  Operations professionals, who
manage risk book reporting and analysis, confirmations, physical product
scheduling and cash management reaffirmed their roles in effectively
accessing, managing and mitigating operational risk.  This focus on
operational risk management will ensure the quality of EWS' earnings, and
support a platform for continuing growth across all commodities in 2001.

Steel Origination
Since its inception in September, the steel group has grown to over 40
people.  They have contacted the majority of the key industry players and
received positive feedback.  Additionally, the group has executed both
physical and financial trades and has 10 products posted on EnronOnline.

Steel prices are at a 20-year low, several large producers have recently
filed for bankruptcy protection, and capital is scarce. The industry needs
both liquidity and price risk management. At this time, Enron is the only
company offering these products. A middle-market group has recently been
formed, which will allow the originators to focus on longer term deals with
embedded capital. The biggest challenge is bringing the "old economy "
incumbents up to speed on derivatives. There may also be some credit issues.
Stay tuned for cash flow and earnings.

GLOBAL FLASH

UK Gas Update
This week the Bacton- Zeebrugge Interconnector surprised the market by
switching flow direction from UK Import to Export despite European spot
prices being lower than UK prices.  The Interconnector's operating rules
allow this to happen at present. Several shippers are lobbying to have these
rules amended to be able to react more quickly to market forces.  This flow
direction switch coincided with the recent cold snap increasing demand
substantially to 430mcm which in turn has resulted in a surge in prompt UK
prices.

EOL activity during this period has been particularly active as we benefit
from the increased volatility in the market.

Enron has several fuel switching options at our Teesside installations which
we use to protect our positions.

Fine weather in Japan
Over the New Year, Enron Japan completed a weather transaction with BTM,
which acted as a broker to the deal.  The deal, whereby we bought the option,
involved a Jan/Feb average temperature call with a maximum payout of 500 mill
JPY.   The transaction acted as a trigger leading to further transactions.
While not a major deal financially, this deal is significant as it offers an
indication that the Japanese weather market is developing and is growing in
size.  Takuro Shioda in our Tokyo office did a great job during the
negotiations.

TPS Gains ISO 14001 Accreditation
On 30th November Teesside Power Station gained accreditation to the
internationally recognised Environmental Management System (EMS) ISO 14001
standard.

ISO 14001 is an international standard that specifies the requirements for an
environmental management system that TPS had to meet in order to achieve
third-party certification. The accreditation will encourage cultural change
by establishing disciplines that ensure policy objectives are met and a
continual improvement in environmental performance is achieved.
