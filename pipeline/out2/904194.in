From Carol Word
Attached are the prayer requests for Wednesday, November 15.  Also,
following is a follow-up to a question about The Lord's Prayer and what
Jesus meant when He said "Lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from
evil".  Mary Rios, thank you for asking.  It has been a rewarding study as I
have searched the Word, Strong's and other resources and it is beautiful.
First, here is an insert from what Eloise, our dear sister that comes to the
Bible Study on Wednesday's with Pat McFarland has to offer.  I asked her to
write it down for us as a remind:
Carol,
Thank you so much for your prayers.  I did get your message and here is
the verse of the Lord's Prayer, we tallked about  in class.  The
Spanish  version is "No, los dejes caer ententacion", interpreted as
"No, Let us not fall into temptation."  Or it can be "No, lead us not
into temptation."  Either one is asking in prayer for our Lord Savior to
help in the choices we are faced with daily and many times there are
temptations.
Carol, the word Lead, I believe is problably what has confused the
lady in class and maybe the word Let might also, but we need to look at
the total verse.  I honestly believe the articulation in much of the
material we process sometimes needs to be looked at closely for precise
meaning.  I believe that in praying and asking for our Lord Jesus to
discern what is really meant, this is my answer.
---------------------
Here is what I feel explains it as well:
When Jesus commanded us to pray "Lead us not into temptation" He was
instructing believers to pray that forces beyond their own control would not
lead them into trials (see Matt 24:20, Revelation 3:10).  ;He is also
commanding believers to watch and pray against entering into temptation
through their own carelessness or disobedience (Matt 26:41, Luke 21:34; Luke
22:40, 46).
Jesus had warned Peter;  "Simon, Simon, behold, Satan hath desired to have
you, that he may sift you as wheat" (Luke 22:31).  Knowing Satan's plans,
Jesus cautioned Peter to watch and pray lest he enter into temptation.  This
indicates that if Pete would have listened to Jesus, he would have remained
strong.
Jesus also knows our potential weaknesses.  He remembers we are dust (Ps
103:14).  He knows our human spirits may be willing, but our flesh is weak.
He realizes that we can give in to temptation as a result of our own
carelessness and disobedience, and Jesus knows of forces can circumstances
beyond our control that can come to try us.  Therefore, He lovingly commands
us to pray "Lead us not into temptation".
Jesus will not lead us there.  When we pray for His leadership, He leads us
away from it.  According to Strong's it is asking Him to make us strong and
be our guide.
There is more to it than only that which we can get into, and should most
definitely, later.
Have a safe, blessed Holiday and know I will be praying for all of you.  See
you next on Wednesday, November 29th when Juan Barba's wonderful Godly
mother will minister to us from a mother's heart.
God Bless you...Carol
