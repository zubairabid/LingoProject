Mr. Skilling-

Here are a few questions I would like to submit before your floor meeting on
the 32nd floor  Wednesday.

1.)  Enron seems to be taking a new approach to their business by taking
assets off the books and looking for new opportunities as a market maker in
new markets.  Is Enron going to be just a trading company?

2.)  If Enron is just a trading company our earnings could be quite
volatile.  How could this affect our stock price?  Will Wall Street be
prepared to accept more volatile earnings?

3.)  Volume on EOL seems to be decreasing since the middle of the year and
new platforms are being introduced into the market place.  Is this going to
have a negative effect on Enron's stock price?

4.) What are some of the new markets Enron plans to explore in the near
future?

5.)  Is Broadband coming along as quickly as Wall St. expects and how much of
our stock price is based on broadband?

I hope these questions are in line with some of the issues you wish to
discuss and I look foward to hearing you speak tomorrow.

Sincerely,

Matt Lenhart
