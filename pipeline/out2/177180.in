THE FRIDAY BURRITO

How many of you believe in telekinesis? Raise my hand...

Last week I was in a rare mood. Before I wrote last week's Burrito, I spent
the better part of Thursday afternoon with my wife sipping wine in Napa
Valley. Considering the volume of e-mail in response to last week's edition,
I should do more drinking, and less worrying. But I do worry. For example,
my wife wants to buy a new car, and this makes me think about one of my
favorite lines, "Get a new car for your spouse - it'll be a great trade!"
But I haven't told her that because she has a fairly decent left jab;
typically to my head. I drive a 1993 Ford Taurus that has 50k miles. It
looks like hell, and gets me to where I want to go. My wife wants a new
Jaguar, top of the line, faster than a bullet. I was telling this story to
our WPTF counsel, Dan Douglass, who asked, "I don't get it. You are driving
a beat up old Ford, and your wife is getting a new Jaguar? How does that
work?" It's not too hard to explain. You see, my wife works in Palo Alto,
about 5 miles from our house, whereas I operate the world headquarters of
this pirate trade association from my "home" office. Each work morning, we
like to arrive at our respective offices at the same time ( in about 3.5
seconds. Now if that makes sense to you, then maybe you can explain how and
why the State of California thinks it can grow 1000 MWs of peaker generation
from seed to flower in five months.

None of the above has much to do with the electricity crisis, but it is a far
more enjoyable conversation. In fact, this week needs a good slug of humor.
Therefore, I have expanded the Odds & Ends (_!_) section to include more
stories and jokes. We deserve it.

I get about six calls a day from newspaper reporters, and they always ask me
at the outset a tough question, "How are you?" I'm never sure. All the
other questions are easy, but the How-Are-You question usually trips me up.
One of our members called me and asked if I had heard about Steve Peace's
quote placing the Texas State Flag on top of the California State Capital? I
had, but I discouraged the caller from sending Peace a Texas Flag as a
prank. I suggested, instead, sending the Senator a pair of boxer briefs with
the emblem of Texas as the pattern. We could put a note in the box, "Don't
put your ass in Texas." Does anyone have a connection on where we can get
the goods?

Our Governor and his staff are actively negotiating the purchase of the
transmission systems from the state's three utilities. Today the LA Times
reported that PG&E is being obdurate, whereas SCE and SDG&E are being helpful
in the negotiations. Why does this sound familiar to me? Most people say
the negotiations are stalled. The Governor says he will announce a deal
today, this Friday. The Governor and the rest of the world never seem to be
on the same page.

In the meantime, I am learning all about pre-petition credit committees, and
how they operate. My hopes are modest for a clean solution to the financial
woes of the California market. On the other hand, consider all the new
things I am learning. For example, the difference between a secured and
unsecured creditor has become quite clear. If you hold a mortgage bond, then
you are a secured creditor. If you are an electric generator or marketer who
sold to the ISO or to the PX, then you are unsecured. If you have a picture
of a utility executive (think male) coming out of a motel room with women
other than his spouse, then you are a secured creditor. If you are a
consumer, taxpayer, and a voter, then you are screwed. As one financial
advisor told me, there are only two sources of revenue to make up the
shortage of money: rate increases and the sale of assets. Then the advisor
said, think of the money from those funding sources like water at the top of
Yosemite Falls. As the money cascades down like falling water, secured
creditors are near the top and get very wet. Unsecured creditors are near
the bottom, and might only get some mist in their face. It all depends how
much water is running over the precipice.

If the state doesn't offer "enough" money for the assets, then I expect the
unsecured creditors will be like Yosemite tourists at the bottom of the Falls
after a dry summer. The mist spray will be a figment of one's imagination.
If the state condemns the transmission assets, then there will be a long and
protracted court settlement regarding the fair market value of the assets.
Not a good outcome if you were expecting to get paid soon. Alternatively, if
the state said to all the generators, "How about 50 on the dollar for each
dollar we owe you?", I doubt there would be many takers.

The secured creditors, by the way, are going to be patient, so it seems. The
bond underwriters place billions of dollars of bond issues, and they are not
too excited about upsetting the State of California. Could get in the way of
future business because the state does issue quite a lot of bonds, and the
underwriting fees are good. So, I don't expect the bond-holders to pull the
trigger anytime soon.

If you thought I was drawing a conclusion based on the discussion above, then
think again. A conclusion is the place where you rest because you got tired
of thinking.

Here is this week's menu.

@@@ LA Times Poll Shows We Have Met the Enemy, and It Is Us

Last Sunday, the LA Times published the results of a poll they conducted on
579 Californians, all over the state. I encourage you to read the survey.
It's available at http://www.latimes.com/news/state/20010218/t000014901.html
. The bottom line is that Californians are mixed up about the electricity
crisis in ways that I could have not predicted.

For example, the Governor gets the highest marks relative to all other
players. His approval rating has gone up from January (29% approval rating)
to 49% in February! However, the 16% approval rating of the PUC is the
lowest among the Gov., the legislature, the utilities, and even President
Bush. The PUC is a tool of the Governor, but apparently that is a secret only
known to the several thousands of us in the regulated power business (There,
there Ms. Lynch. They really love you, but they just don't understand you.).
No telling where merchant generators and power marketers might have placed
had our names been on the list, although I am sure it would be at the low end
of the curve.

More than half of those surveyed do not believe there is an actual shortage
of electricity in California!!!! The response to that issue was the same
last month, and has changed very little. Can someone explain this attitude
to me? I don't get it. What do you have to do to convince Californians that
we are short on capacity? Thirty days in a row of Stage 3 alerts doesn't do
it. I do not believe that anyone reading the LA Times, say, on a regular
basis for the last month would conclude that there is no electricity
shortage. That means few people are reading newspapers for their
information. The rest of the folks get their information from TV, word of
mouth, comic books or (. Stunning result.

Oddly enough, the public doesn't think too highly of long-term power
contracts, very little about nuclear power, but they do favor, by a margin of
three out of four, more thermal power plants. They would be willing to see
such facilities built and operating in their own communities.

In summary, the Gov. is up, the Legislature down, the shortage is
non-existent, we need more power plants, there is a bailout of the utilities
but that is okay, and people are conserving more than ever. Is it any
wonder, then, that the legislation we see emanating from the State Capital is
so mixed up. We are mixed up. What are you going to do about us?

@@@ APX Opens Discussions on a New Transmission Market

Automated Power Exchange (APX), now under the helm of new CEO John Yurkanin
held a one-day seminar on the development of a new market to replace the now
defunct PX adjustment bid market. Adjustment bids, for those of you that do
not trade or schedule in California, are economic signals to the ISO about
one's willingness to adjust your schedule to satisfy transmission constraints
at various transmission bottlenecks on the ISO's grid. APX has provided us
with a thoughtful instrument for managing transmission congestion. I
attended the meeting, and my take away was that APX is proposing an energy
market that allows different parties to be matched for the purpose of
adjusting energy deliveries on either side of a transmission constraint. It
looks very much like the InterSC Adjustment Bid market that market
participants so desperately wanted but never received from the ISO. The
beauty, here, however, is that all the InterSC adjustment bids fall under one
portfolio, APX's, that allows the ISO to maintain the market separation
constraint.

Another benefit provided by APX's new market is the scheduling of RMR units.
John Stremel of APX told us that the CAISO can contribute to the APX market
if there is a feature to instruct the RMR units. The ISO could place their
orders through the APX market if the RMR units are willing to submit
adjustment bids in the same. So doing would give much needed, and now lost
price transparency.

Nothing is free, except grief and heartache, and we all have enough of that.
APX needs funders to get their market off the ground. I have heard several
people grumble about the sales pitch, but let's face it. We have been
complaining for years that the PX was forced on us, the ISO's CONG model was
forced on us, and the RMR dispatch was forced on us. Now that for the first
time we have an opportunity to exercise choice, I find it ironic that people
are fumbling over the dollars. The way the ISO is currently handling
congestion management, with no or few adjustment bids, wreaks havoc on the
energy markets. APX is at least giving us a chance to fix that, and do more.


If you support the APX market in concept, then call John Stremel and tell him
408.517.2120, <jstremel@apx.com>. If money is a problem, then call him and
tell him that too. Let's get creative and demonstrate to those who doubt our
ability to pull ourselves up by the bootstrap that we are able and willing to
do so.

@@@ Some Nasty Legislation

On the heels of the major pieces of legislation enacted in the last few
weeks, we have the "me too" bills that are absolutely nauseating. Here are
short summaries of two legislative turds that simply demonstrate what can
occur when you have too many law makers taking on too few crises.

SB 39x (Speier - D) - This bill would make facilities that have been deemed
exempt wholesale generators by FERC become public utilities subject to CPUC
jurisdiction. It would authorize the CPUC to ensure that generators located
in California are operated in a manner that assures their availability to
maintain reliability. It would allow the CPUC to issue orders and directives
as it deems necessary to accomplish this. It would authorize the CPUC to
prevent the exercise of market power by prohibiting economic or physical
withholding. The bill would also authorize the CPUC to prescribe inspection,
maintenance, and operating practices and procedures for any generator to
ensure the public health and safety , reliability and adequacy of the system.

AB 60x - Herztberg - D) - This bill would require as a condition of receiving
a CEC certification (for new or re-power) the applicant to offer to sell to
California IOU's, Municipal utilities, or DWR, at just and reasonable cost
based price, electrical power generated from the facility. It would also
prohibit the operation of the facility until a maintenance and outage
schedule has been approved by the CEC. A violation of this would be a
criminal act.

Responses to Last Week's Burrito

Always helpful and friendly, Ms. Sheryl Lambertson from PPL Montana (Butte)
wrote to me about my idea to send California's teen population to Montana.
She said, "I personally invite your son to spend the summer with me.
However, 6 million teenagers in a state with a population of less than a
million!!!!! I think we could potentially have power shortages though I'm
sure Montana would do a great job of managing them. I think we can take one
more teenager but we'll leave it at that."

Phil Muller of SCD Solutions offered the following in response to Dr. Davis'
Cure for What Ails Us, "Now that our distinguished governor has finally
announced his plan to save the utilities by taking over their transmission
systems in exchange for paying some of their operating expenses, I can see
the long term plan. First, continue to stall resolution of the credit
situation while generators continue to sell to the ISO with no immediate
prospect of getting paid. Second, cap QF payments at the "just and
reasonable" price of $67/MWh. Third, offer to "bail out" all the generators
by having the state pay a portion of what they're owed in exchange for
turning their power plants over to the state. It looks like Gray learned
business from John D Rockefeller. Force your competitors' prices below cost
until they're forced to sell out to you. Once you own everything you can set
your own just and reasonable prices depending on whether you're running for
election or not. This shouldn't be a problem since the state is not subject
to anti-trust laws."

Long-time friend Bill Metcalfe in Salt Lake City offered the following
response to the WPTF seven-point solution. He wrote, "Price is always a
factor for the individual consumer and some commercial establishments who can
exercise discretionary conservation but may only discourage/encourage
industrial expansion. Price must reflect the pure mechanics of supply and
demand. Therefore, the health of the California economy is closely linked to
the ability to build capacity that will yield a price reflective of our
desires for industrial competitiveness and growth.

"The more we move to State control and the Governor's plan, the more
difficult this all becomes and the costs - well....

"The Dedicated Rate Component (DRC) should provide the necessary incentive
for consumer conservation. Industry may just close up shop when seeing this
and considering the future.

"As you said, "(this) is like a hungry monster that chews up politicians and
spits them out after sucking the political marrow from their bones." Watch
out for quick and seemingly painless fixes - the damage of the past ills does
cost."

Finally, I received a very thoughtful note from Nancy Day, my personal
