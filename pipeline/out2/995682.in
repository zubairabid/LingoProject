I have placed a call to Bo Buchynsky of Diamond Energy (Mitsubishi's US
subsidiary) to see if they are interested.  They tried to bid Pittsburg, but
their partner Mission bagged them at the last minute so they backed out.  We
tried to marry them to Avista, as they both seemed to lack partners at the
time, but that did not work out.  Several months ago, Bo contacted me to
indicate that they were in the market for projects and wanted to be kept on
our lists for contact when opportunities were available. I will contact Bo
and assess continued interest and get a current address.

I think you got all the rest of the companies I thought of.  I also asked
David Kates, who also thought of no more.
