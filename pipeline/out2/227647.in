Janice/Sara,
I had a message from Joe Hunter regarding the attached  proposed letter.  He
said that this has not been implemented yet.  This is a proposal and it was
based on Southern's format that they sent us for review.  He said that they
are only going to use this for 4-5 financial counterparties.
So the real question is....Does legal approve of this method?
If approved, then we will target certain counterparties for Power  (probably
some of the major players).
It will eliminate the need to sign the confirmations.
It will not eliminate the need to check the commercial terms and legal terms
of the confirms.
It will not eliminate the need to send a copy of the confirmation to the file.
It will not eliminate the need to send a copy of the "list" to the file
(there will need to be a copy made for each deal to be placed in each file).
I do not see where we are gaining a great deal of time savings with this
method.  In instances where we send our confirm when we are the Seller and
the Counterparty sends their confirm when we are the Buyer...both of us would
be preparing this schedule.
Overall, I am not opposed to this method.  I do want to talk to commercial
and make sure they are in agreement.  Just let me know the final word from
legal.  Thanks!
