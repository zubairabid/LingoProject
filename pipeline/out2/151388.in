Steve,  I won't be there, but I did leave Shari a voice mail concerning the
PGT Transaction we just completed.  The firm PGT capacity is ours through
Nov. 1, 2008.  The remaining term is being released to Calpine.  The Capacity
Release was just posted and should be completed by Jan 31, 2001.   I don't
have a copy of the contract, but Stephanie Miller could provide that if
needed.  It is a standard FTS-1tariff form.  This transport also backs the
Canadian Producer Net Back deals.  Peter Keohane would be the one to talk to
about these producer deals and their relation to the PGT Capacity.
