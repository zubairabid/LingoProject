Stan/Steve/Rick,

As you probably know, ConEd has never supported electric restructuring and
has been impossible to work with.  I am not surprised with their response.

However, I do have a new idea.  Since EEI is dragging their feet, we should
move this debate to another forum.  What do you think about having Sect.
Richardson or Bob Gee organize a "Blue Ribbon" panel to create an energy
standards board by year end?

In addition, if we could convince Richardson to move NERC (or NARO) into this
new organization, Enron would have a great opportunity to re-create an
organization that we have not been pleased with.
