My comments on the floating price source language follows:

US NG     BasisSwp Chicago  The floating price is shown to be equal to the
"monthly average" price published in NGI's Bidweek        Survey.  The
floating price is more appropriately described as the "Bidweek Average"
price.  This        appears to be an oversight on Dynegydirect's part since
their description for US NG     BasisSwp         SCalBrd correctly describes
the price as the "bidweek average" price.
Any Gas Daily daily midpoint price description The floating price is shown to
be equal to the "midpoint price published in the applicable issue".
Gas        Daily is not published on weekends or holiday, therefore the
question arises as to the pricing mechanism        Dynegydirect will use for
those days.  We add the phrase to our floating price description as follows
to        answer that point:  "if a calendar day is not a businress day then
the price for such day will be the Midpoint        price published on the
next succeeding business day"
