Mike - I'd suggest we move on any decon work for our facilities at the same
time.....
The find of PCBs in the compressors will undoubtedly be the subject of next
week's meeting.  The presence of PCBs does not limit their use at that
station.  PG&E would be reluctant to move the engines around on the system.
Depending upon the concentrations at the time, they may be restricted in
their ability to sell or reuse the compressors.  I'm not aware of any true
decon process for such equipment.  Vector may be able to propose a piecemeal
decon project but it would likely be expensive and involve the outage of the
equipment for a significant period of time.   We might want to gather a group
of folks and go over the agenda and our pososible response to a request by
PG&E to take down thier compression.
