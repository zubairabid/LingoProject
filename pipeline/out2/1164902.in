I exchanged voice mails with Rob Pickel last week to confirm that he got the
submission.  His tone one could describe as polite but "guarded". He said he
would let us know.
Well we gave it our best shot and we now await their response. I suspect our
proposal may be a bit like Cathy Freeman in the 200 metres. A win over Marion
Jones is  possible but no more.
