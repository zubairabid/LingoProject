Elizabeth-

Do you still send confirms to counterparties for physical deals done day to
day?  AEP has a problem with one of the confirms on a deal done Jan. 31.
They sold us two packages of 5000 at PGE Citygate for 12.30 and 12.40.  I
entered this as one deal for 10000 at 12.35.  They need the confirm to match
their records for each deal.  If you could send another confirm I would
appreciate it.  Thanks for your help.
