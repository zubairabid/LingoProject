John,
You know the answer.  Can you call the central desk for the price for spot
gas to be sold to Heartland.  I spoke with Sylvia Pollan and she was to get
back to me.

Charles,
Can you redo the statement for physical gas through the 23rd and include a
line item for the Mark-to-market true-up value as a result of the termination
triggered by their bankruptcy filing.  Jason R Williams of the Credit group
was to redo the termination payment amount.
