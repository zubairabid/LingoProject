Kay:
We are sill awaiting your approval to proceed with this revision of CO 2
(Storage of Unit 1) for Blue Dog.  Your last comment that I did not get GE to
agree to was the change to their responsibility for cosmetic deterioration
during storage.  They believe that any cosmetic deteriation in storage would
be viewed as their fault, therefore there was no real distinction of fault.
They want to be off the hook for normal deterioration that occurs during our
storage in their storage facility.
PS.  Storage has begun.
