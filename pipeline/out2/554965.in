I just re-read this memo.  I can respond for Cuiaba but I need to enlist
Eduardo, Brian & Peter to obtain status and issues on their projects.  I will
forwrd a recent summary of issues on Cuiaba.

Also, by projects do you mean major infrastructure transactions or do you
mean everything thhat is going on?
