Met w/ Tom Bottorff, PG&E, with Mike McDonald, Jake Thomas and Laird Dyer to
pitch a proposal to take-over the management of PG&E's gas procurement and
physical assets (storage, pipeline capacity) in exchange for a guaranteed
index minus deal, ensuring a higher level of shareholder benefit.  Tom was
going to set up other internal meetings for us to explore further.

Tom also indicated that PG&E's number one issue is going to be the
undercollections of their procurement costs that the rate freeze has
created.  I said that we would like to keep the communication lines open to
work on a solution to their situation that we could also support.  I would
suggest that this would be a key point for CA strategy for both EES and ENA
as it does create some leverage for us.
