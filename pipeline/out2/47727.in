BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS
Weather Group
Let,s give a big round of applause to the Weather Team!  Environmental
Finance Magazine ranked the weather group #1 in Online Services and #1 Dealer
in the United States and Europe.  Gary Taylor, manager in weather trading,
comments, "The "Best Dealer" award reflects our counterparties' appreciation
for the significant effort we have made to drive the growth of our market by
making two-sided markets where other companies are only willing to quote
either a bid or an offer.  This award also reflects the innovative nature of
everyone on our desk, and their ability to price non-standard structures for
our customers.  It is truly a team award.  The "Best Online Dealer" award is
simply another testament to the unparalleled success of EnronOnline.  By
providing tight, two-way markets online, we have provided two critical
elements to generate growth in our market: 1) an element of price discovery,
and 2) a quick and easy way to transact."
The Weather Risk Management group launched a new product this week:  Power
Demand swaps.  These contracts use power demand as an index and allow power
market participants (generators, btu distributors, marketers, etc...) to
mitigate volumetric exposures.  The first contract the desk offered is for
the PJM power pool.  On EnronOnline, weekly swaps are available and the desk
has placed option contracts on this index in the broker market.  Inquiries
regarding this product should be directed to Claudio Ribeiro (product
manager) x37313, Gary Taylor x31511, or Valter Stoiani x36906.

Happy 1st Birthday EnronOnline!
This week saw EnronOnline celebrate its first birthday.  During the course of
its first year, EnronOnline has passed a number of milestones including the
addition of a range of new functionalities for customers on the site.
EnronOnline has now come of age, having surpassed the $274 billion mark in
notional value in November.  This represents a total of 478,695 transactions
since the site was launched on 29 November 1999.
The first anniversary was marked by giving the media guest access to
EnronOnline in Europe.  A team from Reuters was invited into Enron House to
receive a full demonstration of EnronOnline and as of today will be able to
quote in reports live prices from EnronOnline.  Other media outlets are being
invited to obtain guest access during the coming weeks as the word of
EnronOnline's success continues to spread...
Australia
Enron Australia continues to assist in the region in a supportive role.
Elliott Katz worked on the GEM migration in Singapore last week with an IT
team from London, Oslo and Singapore.  Approximately 40 users, including
Traders, were migrated to Windows 2000 and the CORP domain.  This is an
important step for the Asia Pacific region, as it brings the three biggest
offices (Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo) into line with corporate standards for
desktop computing.
Japan
E-Power, a JV between Enron and Japanese finance company Orix, has announced
proposals for a 2000MW gas-fired power plant at Mutsu-Ogawara, an industrial
area  in northern Japan.   A feasibility study will be undertaken to define
how the project will go forward and this may include the development of an
LNG terminal in the vicinity.  The nature of the permitting process is such
that the plant would not begin operations for six to seven years.  This
project is just one of several options that E-Power are working on in Japan.
