Sandi:

Apologies.  I meant and forgot to mention on the 11:30 call that the pipeline
group is having their annual customer meeting (VPs of large energy companies
throughout the West and Midwest) at the Santa Barbara Biltmore on April 12th
and 13th.

They would very much like to get Bill Keese to speak (preferably on the
morning of the 13th, but the morning of the 12th would work as well).  They'd
like Bill to discuss the energy situation in California.  They can cover
however much of Bill's costs--if any--that the State of California allows to
be covered.

The folks at the pipeline group asked if we could make the contact with Bill
and see if he's available and willing.  Given your relationship, thought you
might be able to check.  They're anxious to get someone lined up as soon as
possible.  Feel free to contact Laura Lantefield directly at 402.398.7080.
Thanks very much for the help.

Best,
Jeff
