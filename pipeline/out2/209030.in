Do you have Conoco's account?  We talked about this last week.  Did you say
that you were working-on a termination letter on the three Conoco contracts
and how their ROFR works with our notice of termination of the evergreen?
They are:

20747 mainline 10,000/d termination 2/28/02 month to month evergreen
20748 mainline 10,000/d termination 2/28/02 month to month evergreen
20835 san juan 20,000/d termination 2/28/02 year to year evergreen

They all can be terminated by either Party with 365 days notice prior to the
end of the primary term.
