Hi  Folks

Before we get  started...

Congratulations on being in  the playoff hunt. That's something to be proud
of. You have to be a  little bit lucky to get this far but don't hesitate to
pat yourself on the back  as skill plays a huge part. Judging from the
emails, tons of you are still  in mix. Don't forget about our Wall of
Champions feature  where we'll showcase league winners. Stay tuned for more
details.

It's crunch time so  let's jump right into our  Upgraded and Downgraded
Players. As we head down the  final weekend for many teams, identifying
those players moving up or down can be  the difference betweendominating
your Fantasy Bowl or just finishing in  the money. As we head into our  16th
week of listing these players, it,s inevitable that some guys  will have made
both the upgrade or downgrade list. Make sure you understand, what we,re
talking about is players that are moving.  In other words, a player like TE
Ricky Dudley could appear on the  downgrade list and still be good enough to
be a starter in your league. It just means I,m concerned about the  way he
seems to be heading.  Likewise, a player like WR Willie Jackson may make the
upgrade list even  though he,s still fairly far down the list of WRs. It,s
all about which direction players  are moving. Keeping an eye on these
trends as they can very often make all the difference.

Upgrades and  Downgrades. Some of these  players are obvious moves up or
down and some aren't as clear. Here's my  list of guys I see moving this
week.

QBs Moving  Up

QB Jeff Garcia (SF)  Cheatsheets.net Poster Boy Jeff Garcia continues to
roll. No  coincidence that Terrell Owens returned with a vengeance this week.

QB Donovan McNabb (Phi) Mixed  emotions here as I've been hyping McNabb for
weeks as the guy carrying the  Eagles offense. But seeing him on my
opponent's roster in the FanEx  playoffs yesterday was less than heartening
throwing for 4 TDs and 390  yards. Just be aware the Eagles are off this
week and won't return till  week 17.

QB Jon Kitna (Sea) Like Mike  Holmgren, maybe I've been too critical of
Kitna. He continues to play well  and while it likely won't be in Seattle,
he looks like a starter for some team  in 2001.

QB Aaron Brooks (NO) A telling  mark of a great QB is how he performs when
he comes with less than his "A"  game. Brooks looked much less in synch
Sunday and clearly struggled at  times making a few bad throws and missing
open receivers. Yet he hung in  and still posted outstanding numbers. His
108 rushing yards quietly add to  the points. He's a player. I'm starting
him with few  reservations.

QB Kerry Collins (NYG) You  have to believe his confidence is sky high. He
obviously benefited from  the return of Ike Hilliard (who looked very good)
This team is looking  very tough and very balanced right now. The running
game is just good  enough to be a real worry for the defense but not so
dominant that it hurts the  QB.

QB Mark Brunell (Jac) It's  really weird. When the hype finally subsides
about this guy, he starts  delivering Fantasy numbers worthy of hype. Go
figure.

QB Kurt Warner (StL) This may  have been the greatest QB performance in the
history of the league without  scoring a TD. The guy was incredible
completing 84% of his passes (27 of  32) Completing 84% with an average pass
of 12.8 yards is sick. The  TDs will come as Warner looked as good as I've
ever seen him placing the ball  perfectly and directing his offense.

QB Ray Lucas (NYJ) Keep an eye  on Vinnie's groin. Better yet, watch the
injury reports for news on  Vinnie's groin. That's better. We should know
more soon but if it's  serious, Lucas will get the start.



RBs Moving Up

RB Marshall Faulk (StL) I know  you don't need me to list him here but it's
worth noting I think he may be the  best player in the league right now.
Martz fed him the ball 25 times and  he delivered.

RB Eddie George (Ten) George  showed outstanding pass receiving skills and
added 2 receiving TDs to go with  his rushing TD. He reinjured his sore toe
but looks to be ok. Keep  an eye on it though.

RB Fred Taylor (Jac) What a  shocker. Taylor runs wild again as we
predicted. He did tweak a knee  so watch that but if he can go full speed,
he's a no brainer starter against  just about anyone.

RB James Allen (Chi) If  departed Offensive Coordinator Gary Crowton was
dead (don't get excited Bears  fans, he's not), he'd be spinning in his grave
to see Allen garner 37 carries  Sunday. Be a little leery though as a 2.6
ypc carry average only works  when you carry the ball a ton.

RB Travis Prentice (Cle) After  fading badly, Prentice comes roaring back
with a 2 TD performance. He only  had 46 yards on 17 attempts but the TDs
are huge. The Brown offense  featured some crazy looks with Kevin Johnson
occasionally at QB but they looked  much better.

RB Mike Anderson (Den) What  else can you say? The Denver OL is having
another Pro Bowl season.  Anderson is a must start vs any team right now.

RB Ahman Green (GB) I'm very  nervous if I'm Dorsey Levens right now.
Green's been an offensive stalwart  carrying the load week after week.
Everyone always knew he had the  potential to be this good but now he's
delivering.

RB Emmitt Smith (Dal) As was  mentioned on the broadcast yesterday, "Someone
forgot to tell the Redskins this  game is a rivalry" You know the Cowboys
and Emmitt in particular had to  enjoy humiliating the Redskins. It would be
a bold move even for him but I  wouldn't be surprised in the least to see
Danny Snyder fire Terry Robiskie  before his obligatory three games are up.

RB Jamal Lewis (Bal) Once  again, Lewis rolls over the opponents and makes
me look bad for dissing him this  Summer... Against the Cardinals this week,
he has the chance to be even  better.

RB Warrick Dunn (TB) If Dunn  had any help, the Bucs would scary. Right
now, he's doing it all by  himself. Which probably isn't a bad thing for
Dunn owners.

RB Tony Richardson (KC)  Richardson netted 5.2 ypc on 17 carries. Donnell
Bennett looks to have  cartilage damage to his knee so Richardson's workload
should increase.  It's a shame someone has to get hurt for Gunther
Cunningham to give Richardson  more looks.

RB Tshimanga Biakabutuka (Car)  Don't hold your breath but Biakabutuka is
making noises about returning to the  lineup this week. We'll see...

RB Terry Allen (NO) In a  lesser version of Denver's OL, it appears most
anyone can run effectively behind  these guys. Allen looked rejuvenated
Sunday and should only get better as  he gets familiar with the system.

RB Chris Warren (Phi) Remember  that he's off this week but if your league
runs through week 17, he could be a  factor.



WRs Moving Up

WR Sean Dawkins (Sea)  Dawkins is quietly posting some very strong
numbers. As is Jon  Kitna. Dawkins is drawing a lot of looks and could
continue his  roll.

WR Torrance Small / Charles Johnson  (Phi) Look what QB Donovan McNabb can
do when his WRs decide to  show up. If they can continue to play well, this
team could be  scary. Remember they're off this week but return in week 17.

WR Amani Toomer (NYG) Of the resurging Giants,  Toomer's leading the
charge. He's making plays all over the field and even  had a nice run again.

WR Terrell Owens (SF) The  scary part is he could have been even better than
the 129 yard / 1 TD  performance Sunday. He looked very good coming back
from the toe injury  and should only get better. The 49ers are trying to
nail down their WR  corps for 2001 and Owens is making a statement.

WR Ed McCaffrey (Den) It's  easy to get excited whenever he outplays Rod
Smith but the truth of the matter  is that they're both excellent WRs. I
love McCaffrey and his 6th grade  shoulder pads. He's the anti-Eric
Dickerson when it comes to pads (or lack  thereof) Easy Ed goes with pretty
much the Helmet and Pee Wee Shoulder  pads and that's it. Oh yeah, he's also
a great WR...

WR Darrell Jackson (Sea)  Jackson made the Upgrade List last week and
delivered. I see few reasons  why he won't continue to shine.

WR Torry Holt (StL) It's tough  to predict which Ram WR will catch the
passes from Warner but as I said several  weeks ago, Holt may be the best WR
on the team. And that's no sleight to  Isaac Bruce - Holt's that good.

WR Terry Glenn (NE)  Glenn's putting together one of his most complete
seasons. And Bledsoe's  continuing to play pretty good football which helps.

WR Willie Jackson (NO) 1  catch. 1 TD. You gotta like a guy who gets right
to the point.  Joe Horn is the clear #1 threat but Jackson is a serious
option too.

WR Germane Crowell (Det) This  didn't look like a guy returning from a
broken leg. He should continue to  get better as he becomes more involved in
the flow of things.

WR Bobby Shaw (Pit) It seems  hard to believe, but Bobby Shaw is a
legitimate starter in many leagues.  He's getting lots of looks and the
Steeler are throwing the ball.

WR Ike Hilliard (NYG) Hilliard  looked well rested as he roared back onto
the scene. An sprained knee  suffered by Joe Jurevicius will likely increase
Hilliard's playing time even  further.

WR Donald Hayes (Car) Hayes  looked better as expected and turned in a nice
game catching 5 passes for 77  yards. The Panthers need to remain focused
but if they can, Hayes could  contribute.



TEs Moving Up

TE Johnny McWilliams (Min)  McWilliams again was active catching 5 passes
for 53 yards. I like any  receiver on this team.

TE Andrew Glover (NO) Glover's  starting to become a very integral part of
the New Orleans passing game.  It's hard to imagine this team losing
RickyWilliams, Jeff Blake and Cam  Cleeland.

TE Kris Mangum (Car) He's no  Wesley Walls but he's more than adequate.

TE Greg Clark (SF) He only had  24 yards but the 4 receptions were a nice
bonus.



QBs Moving  Down

QB Scott  Mitchell (Cin) The clock struck midnight as Mitchell became the
guy we remembered. This team is pretty much Corey Dillon and a roll of the
dice with Peter Warrick for his big play potential.

QB Jeff  George (Was) I've gotta say I'm really surprised George didn't
post some great numbers. Albert Connell isn't nearly as good as he thinks
he is and that may be part of the problem.

QB Steve  Beuerlein (Car) It's clear to everyone that 1999 was a career
year. He's still subject to a great game here and there but he's just too
streaky to lean very heavily on.

QB Shaun  King (TB) This guy just isn't very good.

QB Charlie  Batch (Det) I've never been a big Charlie Batch fan although
he's  certainly had his days. He looked a bit lost at times Sunday and
possibly  losing Herman Moore won't help. (Although German Crowell is back)

QB Troy  Aikman (Dal) I hope Aikman does himself a favor and gives Steve
Young a call. A sore back is one thing. Not remembering your kid's  names
is an entirely different matter. It's not worth it, Guy.

QB Ryan  Leaf (SD) Part of it was Baltimore. A large part of it was  Leaf.

QB Jay  Fiedler (Mia) Fiedler suffered a torn rotator cuff on his non
throwing shoulder. The Dolphins will make a decision Wednesday likely
whether it'll be Fiedler or Huard this week at QB.

QB Vinnie  Testeverde (NYJ) Vinnie suffered a groin injury that may or may
not be serious. He's not getting any younger though so keep an eye on this
one.



RBs Moving  Down

RB Ron  Dayne (NYG) It's just hard to get excited about starting this guy
as he's such a risk to be taken out of the gameplan. He's always liable to
grab that short yardage TD but you just don't know when or where they'll
happen.

RB Jerald  Moore (FA) Things change quickly in this league. A few  weeks
ago, Moore looked to be the #1 RB. Now he's unemployed.

RB Darnell  Autry (Phi) I'd expect that Chris Warren will cut into his
time when they return.

RB Jamel  White (Cle) Travis Prentice carried the load while White watched
this week.

RB Brad  Hoover (Car) He came back to reality this week. On top of  that,
it looks like his days may be numbered as Tshimanga Biakabutuka looks to  try
and return this week.



WRs Moving  Down

WR Herman  Moore (Det) Moore suffereda neck stinger  Sunday. He could
likely give way to Germane Crowell who looked very good  returning from his
injury.

WR Tai  Streets (SF) Conventional wisdom had Streets seeing more action  as
the 49ers tried to see what they had for 2001 but with the return of Terrell
Owens, it looks like Streets will be limited.

WR  Courtney Hawkins (Pit) He's losing time to Bobby Shaw. The  Steeler WRs
seem to be pretty well set with Hines Ward and Shaw.

WR Danny  Farmer (Cin) Farmer had made a little noise pushing for a spot
alongside Peter Warrick but it doesn't look like it's going to make any
difference.

WR J.J.  Stokes (SF) Like Tai Streets, Stokes suffers from the return of
Terrell Owens.

WR  Sylvester Morris (KC) Morris continues his regression which  should send
red flags as owners look towards 2001.

WR  Keyshawn Johnson (TB) With Shaun King struggling, I don't see a  bright
future for Keyshawn ahead. He sounds like a politician conceding  when he
speaks of the team finding it's identity in running the ball.



TEs Moving  Down

TE Anthony  Becht (NYJ) In the up and down season from Anthony Becht, it
looks like he's headed down a bit. The injury to Testeverde affects his
stock in a negative way.

TE Tony  McGee (Cin) Not that McGee was carrying many FF teams but he
suffered a broken ankle.

TE Jeff  Thomason (Phi) Looks like Chad Lewis has resumed his role as the
primary TE.

TE David  LaFluer (Dal) Between injuries to himself and QB Troy Aikman,
LaFluer was limited and it looks like it may not be changing anytime soon.
