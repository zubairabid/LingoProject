Sara Shackleton, an attorney in our group, is drafting some language that we
will be proposing to Deutsche Bank in response to their request that we add
the Enron companies they do financial business with to the definition of
"Specified Entity".   We have some concern that by adding certain Enron
entities to Specified Entity, a default in a swap transaction could possibly
default certain structured loan transactions with a swap component, and we
are trying to carve those transactions out.
Sara is also working on the FUNB agreement.  I checked with her and the FUNB
agreement we had been working from was so old that we agreed to start from
the latest form of our agreement, so Sara sent Dee Travella at FUNB a revised
draft on 11/8/00.  Sara's direct phone no. is 713/853-5620.
