Sally,
This is the information regarding the HR Lunch and Learn Series.   Please
review it and let us know if there are any changes that you would like to
make.
If you like it the way it is please help us in promoting it by encouraging
all of the Managers and Directors to attend as their schedules allow.   I
would suggest an e-mail to all Managers and Directors plus a hard copy at
Monday's Staff Meeting for all Directors to disseminate.
Tana Cashion and Tim O'Rourke played key roles in the development of this
series and deserve much credit for their input and insight.  They will also
play the role of facilitators for some of the management development
sessions.

PS: I'm sending you a hard copy of these attachments to you this afternoon
for your review.
