Health & Fitness Tip of the Day
Thursday November 30, 2000

Insoluble Fiber

Insoluble fiber is a type of carbohydrate that is found exclusively in plant
products. It's the part of the plant that is not fully digested, thus adding
bulk to feces. This promotes the movement of fecal material through the
intestines, which promotes bowel regularity. Insoluble fiber can be found in
fruits, vegetables, brown rice, wheat bran, popcorn, nuts, whole wheat, and
many other plant-derived foods.
