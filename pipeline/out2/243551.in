Sara, I completed review of the Bear Stearns agreement and re-reviewed the
others on Friday.  I will find you in the late afternoon to discuss after I
get out of a meeting this afternoon.
Friday was a marathon day for brokerage agreements -- we stopped the clock on
almost everything to completed JP Morgan almost from start to finish before
their lawyer went on a two week vacation.
I hope you enjoyed Florida and the wedding!
