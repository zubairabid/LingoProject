I'm not sure the RECs provide an example of an auction supply process.  In
the first few years after privatisation, many RECs signed long-term PPAs and
took equity in Independent Power Producers.   They were allowed to pass the
associated purchase costs through to consumers.  Apart from that I believe
their purchasing was via a mix of longer-term and shorter term purchases
mainly off the major generators.  The RECs individual purchasing decisions
were at their discretion and I'm not aware of any centralised, public auction
that has been used in the form anticipated in California.  The only example I
can think of an "auction" was in the other direction: Nuclear Electric used
to sell off its power via an auction style route while in public ownership.

I also can't think of any international examples which fit the Californian
idea, but I'll rack my brains further.
