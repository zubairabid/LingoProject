Talking points for Jean-Marie Messier, Chairman and CEO of Vivendi.

Blockbuster has had several meetings with Universal to obtain rights to
content for the video on demand (VOD) offering.  Blockbuster has proposed an
agreement to license product for both VHS/DVD rentals and the video on demand
offering.

The negotiations have stalled because Universal has not been willing to sign
any long-term agreements without Vivendi's support.

Blockbuster has refused to renew their agreement with Universal for VHS/DVD
rentals until Universal agrees to grant digital VOD rights.  This will be
detrimental to both parties.

We would like for Vivendi to communicate to Universal that they would support
a VOD agreement between Universal and Blockbuster for digital content
rights.  A conversation with Mr. Messier on this topic would be appreciated.
