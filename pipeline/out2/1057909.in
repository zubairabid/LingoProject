Weekly Update
Dec. 1, 2000

The Texans made national headlines this week when University of Miami head
coach Butch Davis arrived in Houston Tuesday. Davis visited with Texans Owner
Bob McNair and Executive Vice President/General Manager Charley Casserly
before flying back to Miami. McNair then addressed the media at the Hyatt
Regency Houston.

"We will be visiting with a number of people, some of whom will not be a
candidate and others who perhaps will be a candidate," McNair said. "Butch is
a very highly qualified coach. He has done an outstanding job at the
University of Miami. He has all the credentials in my view. He is certainly
well qualified to hold the position.

"But we are just now getting started in this process and the visit we had
today was really just to get to know each other."

Davis, in his sixth season at UM, led the Hurricanes to a 10-1 record and the
Big East title this season. Miami is currently ranked second in both the
Associated Press and ESPN/USA Today polls. Davis owns a 50-20 record at UM
and is 3-0 in bowl games. The Hurricanes have already clinched a spot in this
season,s Bowl Championship Series. If Kansas State upsets top-ranked Oklahoma
Saturday, Miami would face Florida State in a 1-2 Orange Bowl bout. If the
Sooners win, the Hurricanes would play in either the Fiesta or Sugar Bowl.

Before arriving at UM, Davis spent six seasons as an assistant with the
Dallas Cowboys, the last two as defensive coordinator.

"I don,t know what the future might hold but he,s certainly the type of
person we,d like to have in our organization," McNair said.

McNair and Casserly flew to San Antonio Wednesday for a luncheon at The
Argyle. Casserly had addressed San Antonio,s Touchdown Club earlier this
fall. Minnesota Vikings Owner Red McCombs, a resident of San Antonio, also
attended.

"We think it is important that we be viewed as a South Texas team," McNair
said. "We would love to have the fans in San Antonio feel an affinity for our
team and like the way we play and the way we run the club. Our goal right now
is to reach out to them and let them know we are interested in them and that
we are going to have a first-class, high-quality operation."

Casserly flew to Minneapolis Thursday to scout the Vikings-Lions game at the
Metrodome before returning to Houston for scouting meetings Friday morning.

The Texans will hold their first Houston Texans Junior Training Camp Saturday
at Memorial Park. The first session, which runs from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., is
reserved for children from Houston Parks and Recreation who participated in
NFL Flag Football. The NFL Flag Football playoffs and championship game will
follow the session. Texans fans can listen to KIKK 95.7 FM to win a spot in
the second session, which runs from 3-5 p.m. Casserly and local NFL Alumni
will be on hand to provide instruction. The event is sponsored by KIKK,
Academy Sports & Outdoors and Gatorade.
