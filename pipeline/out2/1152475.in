After I wrote this I was forwarded Steve Hall's summary.  There's some
redundancy but hopefully, this provides a few more details.    Also, Mary H.
and I are informed that on Friday the FERC issued an order that appears to
approve the ISO,s request in full.

Bullet Summary of the ISO's Amendment No. 33 (December 8 Filing):

The following is a summary of the filing made by the ISO.

1) ISO,s $250/MWh Soft Cap
a) Summarized: ISO Claims its proposal is identical to the FERC proposed soft
cap but raises the soft cap level to $250 from the $150/MWh proposed by the
FERC: &The ISO would replace the current cap on Imbalance Energy bids with an
interim &soft8 price cap based on the price mitigation proposal in the
Commission,s November 1 Order. The ISO,s scheduling system will not reject
Energy bids priced in excess of the $250/MWh price cap, but will evaluate
those bids in price merit order. However, if the ISO issues Dispatch
instructions to Scheduling Coordinators for Energy that has been bid in
excess of the $250 soft cap, those bids will not set the Market Clearing
Price for Imbalance Energy. Rather, those Scheduling Coordinators will be
paid in accordance with their bids.8

b) Refund risk and cost documentation above $250. &Imbalance Energy above the
level of the soft price cap would be subject to refund, based on subsequent
review by the Commission. It also should require Scheduling Coordinators that
submit such bids to supply supporting cost information to the Commission, as
well as to the ISO and to the California Electricity Oversight Board so that
they may bring questionable bids to the Commission,s attention.

i) Appears to imply that the proposed reporting requirement is supplemental
to what was requested by the FERC. See p. 8

ii) Regarding production costs:  fuel, taxes, emission credits, startup costs
are all listed as costs.  However, no mention of noncontiguous scheduling
costs or reasonable profit.

iii) Quasi safe harbor on opportunity costs:  In a footnote to cover letter,
ISO states it will particularly scrutinize any opportunity costs in excess of
10% of the production costs or $25/MWh, whichever is lesser.

c) Useful quote: &In light of current fuel prices and the ISO,s recent
experience in receiving less than a thousand MW of Imbalance Energy bids at
prices of $150 or less in many hours, the ISO believes that a $150 soft cap
would be tantamount to procuring all Imbalance Energy on an as-bid basis.8

d) Effective date: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00.

e) Term of this soft cap:  lesser of 3 mo (3/8/01) or whenever the Commission
supercedes it by its own order.

f) Applicable tariff sections.  Section 2.5.23.2 and .3.  See attachments
A1/B1 to the filing.


2) Participating Generator Penalties
a) Summary: &the ISO proposes in Amendment No. 33 to assess penalties against
Participating Generators that refuse to operate in response to an ISO
Dispatch instruction during a System Emergency or when the ISO is acting to
avoid an imminent or threatened System Emergency. They would be charged an
amount equal to twice the highest price that the ISO paid for Energy for each
hour in which the Participating Generator failed to respond. In addition, if,
during that hour, the ISO curtailed Load to manage a System Emergency other
than Load that has not been designated by agreement or regulation as
interruptible, the Participating Generator would pay an additional penalty of
$1000/MWh for the Energy that it failed to deliver.8
b) Allowed excuse:  The penalties would not apply if the Participating
Generator has notified the ISO (within the hour of instruction), and
subsequently demonstrates (documentation within 72 hours) , that its
Generating Unit, System Unit or System Resource was physically unable to
operate or that operation would violate a legal restriction that could not be
waived.

c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of 5.6.1 .2 and .3. See
attachments A2/B2 to the filing.

d) Effective date: Same as the ISO,s new soft cap: 4 p.m. PST 12/8/00

e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision.

3) Load Imbalance Penalties

a) Summary: &Scheduling Coordinators who rely on that  market to serve their
Loads the ISO,s costs of obtaining Energy through bids above the proposed
soft price cap or through out-of-market Dispatches when bids are
insufficient. Specifically, those costs would be allocated to Scheduling
Coordinators in proportion to their Demand that appears unscheduled in
real-time (underscheduled Load) and Generation that is scheduled but does not
appear in real-time, except to the extent that the underscheduled Load or
undelivered Generation is balanced within the Scheduling Coordinator,s
portfolio.8  The costs of dispatching units that have bid above the Market
Clearing Price for Energy to Scheduling Coordinators in proportion to their
Net Negative Uninstructed Deviations (in essence, the amount by which their
metered Demand exceed their metered Generation). Cover letter, p. 10.

b) Net Negative Uninstructed Deviation (NNUD) defined: &The real time change
in Generation or Demand associated with underscheduled Load (i.e., Load that
appears unscheduled in real time) and overscheduled Generation (i.e.,
Generation that is scheduled in forward markets and does not appear in real
time). Deviations are netted for each BEEP Interval, apply to a Scheduling
Coordinator,s entire portfolio, and include Load, Generation, Imports and
Exports8


c) Applicable tariff sections. Amends portions of  11.2.4.2.1.  See
attachments A3/A3/B3 to the filing.

d) Effective date:  For loads scheduled for  12/12/00.  (Essentially, loads
scheduled on 11/11 for next day).

e) Term:  I did not see any sort of sunset provision.


4) Useful Info from the Detmers Declaration

a) &During the recent 7-day period from December 1, 2000 through December 7,
2000, planned Generating Unit outages have averaged roughly 4,000 MW. During
this same 7-day period, forced or unplanned outages of generating have be
very high, averaging approximately 7,000 MW. &
b) &For example, for the last four days (December 4, 2000 to December 7,
2000) we have purchased 255,000 MWh of OOM Energy. The cost of these
purchases were approximately $167 million. MWh.8  (Equivalent to an average
OOM cost of $655/MWh.)
