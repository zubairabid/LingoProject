Please find attached a first draft of the following documents relating to the
Canadian form of EEI master agreement:

1.  Clean copy of Canadianized EEI base contract
2.  Copy of the Candianized EEI base contract, blacklined to show the changes
to the US form
3.  Canadianized schedules to the EEI contract, including only the three
products previously included in the industrial power master
4.  Form of EEI Cover Sheet, including the porposed changes to the Canadian
form of base contract that Enron Canada would include as part thereof

I will develop over the next while a set of situation specific riders that
Enron Canada can use, similar to those riders developed by ENA.

Please provide me with any comments you may have with respect to these
documents.  I understand that Chris has a fair amount of pressure on him to
table our proposed form of the Canadianized EEI documents to the Ontario
drafting group before their next meeting on November 22.
