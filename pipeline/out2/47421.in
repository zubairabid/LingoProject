I set up a deal with Riverside where we can give them SP15 and they will give
us back NOB. They will do this for us for $30. They have capacity to do this
HE9-22 on Peak days. HE 1-8 and 23-24 they have no capacity due to
commitments to BPA.

They said they are prepared to do this on a regular basis with us if it
works. The deal is transmission contingent and they will pay us back in
physical power at NOB a later date. This was their suggestion, as this is
what worked best for them.  It also limits a lot of our risk and downside as
the NW lately has always  traded at a premium to SP.

At NOB take it to Snohomish and back down to Malin. Ryan set up the Account
numbers with BPA and it is  #794811    (Our Firm from NOB-BIG EDDY, and Non
firm BIG EDDY to Snohomish) and we also have Snohomish to the ISO which is #
882409.
