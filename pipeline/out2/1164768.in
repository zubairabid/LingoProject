<< Rev up your engines and prepare for an evening built for speed...the Race
Car Club is hosting its second annual unofficial Grand Prix Party at the
historic Rice Lofts on Friday, September 29, 2000, from 8:00 p.m. until
1:00 a.m.  Celebrate Houston's 2000 Texaco Grand Prix with the velocity for
which the Race Car Club is known, as eCitySuites, Quiero Pisco and a revved
up roster of Houston's own social racers steer the Race Car Club fun at the
Rice that evening.

Playing on stage in the Crystal Ballroom will be Texas' own Global Village,
along with the Sheri Lavo Trio in the Empire Room, the El Orbits on the
balcony and DJ Lucky LaRue.  Noted Downtown Houston restaurants will be
serving their menu favorites and there will be five open bars. Fashionable
attire is a requisite, along with your all-inclusive entrance fee ($35/45
pre-sale or $45 at the door).  A portion of the evening's proceeds will be
donated to AIDS Foundation Houston and the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
