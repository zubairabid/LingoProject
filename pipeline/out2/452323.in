ENRON AMERICAS

Michigan, White Pine Energy, Ada Cogeneration Plant ) The U.S. EPA included
Ada Cogen Plant in its Section 126 rulemaking, adopted in January 2000.  This
rulemaking established emission limits for electric generation plants in 12
states in the North East. The EPA also included Ada Cogen Plant on the list
of plants required to reduce emissions under the EPA SIP call.  The Illinois
EPA is currently developing regulations to comply with the EPA SIP Call
requirements.  Under the Section 126 rulemaking and the proposed Illinois,s
SIP call regulations, Ada Cogen Plant  will be required to install Selective
Catalytic Reduction (SCR) by 2003 to meet stringent NOx emission limits.  At
an estimated capital cost of $5 million and an O&M cost of $500,000 per year,
the plant may be forced to shut down.

Gus Eghneim filed a petition with the U.S. EPA to exclude Ada Cogen Plant
from the Section 126 rulemaking.  The size of the plant and its operating
history were used as justification for the exemption.  If and when this
petition is approved, Gus Eghneim will file a similar petition with the
Illinois EPA to exclude Ada Cogen from the SIP Call Rulemaking.  A meeting
with the U.S. EPA will be scheduled in the next two weeks to discuss the
petition.

Air Quality/Multipollutant Strategy -- Carbon Dioxide Regulation -  Jeff
Keeler coordinated Enron's involvement in activities surrounding President
Bush's statement (in a letter to several Senators) that mandatory caps on CO2
emissions should not be included in any multipollutant approaches for the
power sector.  Jeff maintained communications with EPA, White House, and
congressional contacts on the subject, and advised our "Clean Power Group"
coalition and congressional staff on possible responses and future
strategies.  Jeff is working closely with Senate Environment Committee staff
to craft legislation that will still move forward on NOx, SO2 and mercury
while continuing to look at meaningful approaches to carbon reduction.

EPA Appointments - Jeff Keeler worked on gathering information and vetting
candidates withing Enron on two EPA appointments critical to Enron businesses

developing market-based systems for trading renewable energy credits:
PJM: Drafted a "strawman" detailing a credit trading program to submit to
PJM, asking them to form a working group.  Organizing a stakeholder meeting
for March 20th in Philadelphia to form a coalition to lobby for a credit
trading program.  Stakeholders include Community Energy, PG&E National Energy
Group, Green Mountain, Center for Resource Solutions, Penn Futures, National
Exchange Carriers and NCE-Pearson.
NePool: Submitted comments on an RFP that NePool is issuing for the
Generation Information System on March 21
Renewable Energy Desk: Coordinating with Elliot Mainzer of ENA West on
forming a team to respond "holistically" to the regulatory and public
relations/messaging needs of the new commercial venture.

Clean Power Product Development - Stacey Bolton worked on several initiatives
toward developing Enron commercial opportunities
PA C&I Negawatts Program:  Presented proposal for a C&I Negawatt program in
Pennsylvania to the Green-e Negawatt Subc.  Received clearance on conceptual
idea to present the proposal to the full Mid-Atlantic Advisory Committee on
Monday, March 19th.  If approved, we will work through the fine details of
the program w/ Green-e, submit it for final approval to their Green Power
Board, and launch the program this June.
Energy Efficiency Allowances:  Met with EES (Heather Mitchell and Elizabeth
Howley) regarding developing a proposal for energy efficiency savings to be
eligible as NOx allowances to the TNRCC.  Spoke with Bill Jordan at the TNRCC
regarding this issue, timeframe, and method for presenting a proposal to
them.  Also set a goal to attempt to get Negawatt Credits to trade on TX REC
and voluntary certificates of generation system.

Environmental Reporting/Compliance - Stacey Bolton worked with EES to advise
them on various reporting requirements:
CEC Annual Report:  EES submitted their annual report to the California
Energy Commission and Green-e on March 1st.  The CEC had several questions
regarding tying EES purchases to specific generators.  Worked w/ EPMI and EES
to help tie our purchase numbers (between EPMI, the APX and EES) in our
annual report in response to CEC's questions.
Patagonia & Fetzer:  Worked w/ Mike Smith and Peggy Mahoney to get them up to
speed on our disclosure requirements in CA (given that EES is no longer
delivering commodity to large customers) and that the CEC was okay w/ our
green tag product to Fetzer and Patagonia.

COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE

Commercial Opportunities
Abbott Laboratories:  Jeff Keeler forwarded to EES information about an
opportunity to provide energy/environmental outsource services to Abbott
Labs, based on contact with their head of energy/EHS operations at the GEMI
new members meeting.
Landauer Deal:  Stacey Bolton presented EES w/ a business opportunity to join

stakeholders (ENA, EES, Enron Wind) for next week to discuss full commodity
and outsourcing options coupled w/ green tags from our Enron Wind facility in
West Texas.
Wind supply in PA: Stacey  Bolton was contacted by Community Energy in PA

$358 million in funding recently approved by New Jersey for new energy
efficiency and renewable energy programs.

EPA Diesel Sulfur Regulations - Jeff Keeler provided EGM with information on
the EPA's regulations requiring additional removal of sulfur content from
diesel gasoline.   New Diesel sulfur requirements will require significant
increased capital expenditures by refiners, which affects the EGM price curve
for fuels, as well as trading, risk management and origination opportunities
with refiner customers.  This information may also be the basis for exploring
new markets for cleaner diesel products.

Distributed Generation - Equity Investments - Jeff Keeler provided follow up
advice and analysis to Enron Principal Investments group on environmental
regulatory drivers affecting markets for distributed generation technologies
and federal/state incentive monies available for projects involving
distributed generation technologies.   Principal investments has made equity
investments in a number of new technologies, and is considering many future
investments -- environmental regulation is a significant driver for many of
these technologies.
