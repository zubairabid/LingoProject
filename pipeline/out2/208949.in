I wanted to share some great news with you about a major corporate initiative
within ETS, called the iBuyit project, that you should know about and be
looking forward to.  iBuyit is a tool that will make it easier for you to
purchase the things you need to get your job done and/or to operate our
business. Some key points related to iBuyit are:

Employees at all levels across ETS will be able to access iBuyit on their
computers much like the Enron Intranet.   iBuyit provides an upgrade to the
existing B2B Web-Based Procurement tool.
iBuyit will utilize a new catalog system (REQUISITE) that will make it
easier for you to identify material items and incorporate them into the
requisition.
iBuyit will not only make it simple for you to buy on-line, but it can also
serve as your single, convenient source to access other tools and information
you use everyday at Enron.

Stan Horton, Rod Hayslett, and Phil Lowry decided back in December that ETS
would take the lead by being the first business unit to begin working with
Global Strategic Sourcing (GSS), who is developing iBuyit.  Both field and
Houston-based ETS employees have been involved with iBuyit efforts to-date to
help determine how iBuyit can best be used to support our employees and our
business.  More of you will be involved as the iBuyit project progresses.

iBuyit will be deployed to ETS, Corporate, EBS, EES, and EWS in a phased
approach during the first three quarters of 2001.  Starting in April, iBuyit
will be available to certain groups of ETS employees for the purchase of
office supplies and travel.  iBuyit will be implemented on a full scale
across ETS in July.

Those of you in Engineering may be aware of the ongoing MLRP efforts and may
be wondering about the impact of iBuyit.  Because of the unique nature of its
business, Engineering has decided to continue moving forward with MLRP.  But,
we will also continue to explore ways for iBuyit to complement MLRP and
benefit Engineering,s business.

As the person ultimately responsible for iBuyit,s success within ETS, I
wanted to share my enthusiasm with you as early as possible about iBuyit.  In
addition to what I already mentioned, iBuyit strongly supports ETS,s existing
Procurement and Supply Management strategy, will allow the company to save
money by taking advantage of its relationships with preferred suppliers, and
will help us to achieve a greater return on our investments in cutting-edge
technology.  As you can tell, there are many strong reasons for all of us
within ETS to be excited about iBuyit.

So, stay tuned.  You may be asked to actively participate in iBuyit efforts,
but I guarantee that you will have many opportunities to hear and learn more
about iBuyit in the coming months.  You will also have many opportunities to
have your questions answered and opinions heard - starting here.  If you have
any questions or comments, simply reply to this e-mail - I will appreciate
hearing from you.
