HOUSTON -- Enron Communications, Inc., a leader in the delivery of high
bandwidth application services like streaming rich media, announced today it
has signed ten new "ePowered Distribution" partners, extending broadband
access and TV-quality media to an estimated 25 million desktops through an
estimated 500 points of presence throughout the country.
New ePowered partners include RCN, FlashNet, GST Telecommunications, PDQ.NET,
NetRail, FirstWorld, Orconet, VillageNet, Show Digital, and Cmetric.
Existing partners include GTE Internetworking, Verio, Epoch Internet,
NorthPoint, Electric Lightwave, InterNAP, EasyStreet, and Telecommute
Solutions. The announcement was made in San Jose at ISPCon, a leading trade
show dedicated to the Internet provider industry.
"Our relationship with Enron enables PDQ.NET to provide next generation
broadband desktop applications for our customers and addresses enterprise
demand for mission critical e-business solutions," said Billy Ladin, CEO,
PDQ.NET.  "The Enron Intelligent Network is the key here " unlike other
distribution methods available today, Enron provides an unparalleled quality
of service and scalability."
The ePowered distribution program offers distributors a shared revenue model,
reliable quality of service, the ability to fully integrate Enron
Communications, point of presence servers with those of the ISPs, and
comprehensive joint sales, marketing and network integration services. Unlike
other distribution programs that rely on the public Internet, Enron
Communications connects ISPs directly to the Enron Intelligent Network
offering a one-hop platform with high quality of service, low latency, and
the scalability that enterprise customers demand.  In addition, this service
model allows distribution partners to immediately differentiate their service
by offering broadband-optimized streaming multimedia content and applications
to Web users.
"Our ePowered distribution partners can now offer their customers
differentiated services, like ePoweredTM Media Cast, which streams video to
the desktop at an average bit rate speed of 200 Kbps and has capabilities of
delivering streams at 1 Mbps or higher -- up to 50 times faster than what is
currently available on the public Internet," said Joe Hirko, president and
CEO of Enron Communications, Inc.  "We can offer the speed and quality that
others cannot because we have built a pure IP network that provides a
broadband overlay to the public Internet that results in higher capacity and
better transmission quality."
The Enron Intelligent Network is based on a distributed server architecture,
a pure Internet protocol strategy, Enron,s fiber and satellite distribution,
and the embedded software intelligence that sets it apart from other network
providers.  The Enron Intelligent Network enables a whole new breed of
application services, called ePoweredTM services, which transport rich media
and live, streaming video, faster than using the public Internet.  Enron
Communications serves major markets nationwide with 12 POPs in Boston, New
York, Washington DC, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco,
Seattle, Portland, San Jose and Los Angeles.
How it Works
Enron Communications integrates its metropolitan area POPs into the ePowered
distributor partners, local POPs, which allows the distributor to offer its
streaming video delivered at up to 1 Megabit per second, or around 30 frames
per second -- full-screen TV-quality.  Enron Communications shares revenues
with the distribution partners and offers a higher quality of service on the
Enron Intelligent Network, than may be available on the Internet.

Intelligent NetworkTM, a Pure IPTM broadband overlay to the Internet. Enron
Communications also provides rich, multimedia ePowered TMapplication services
