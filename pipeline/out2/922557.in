I agree fully with the last sentence.  E mail is not an appropriate forum to
discuss an issue like this.  This may be somewhat moot given Fernley's latest
e mail but I believe this warrants direct communication.  Fernley, I would
suggest you set up a discussion that would include this group and may grow to
include AA at some point to get their perspective directly.  As I have
indicated before, I believe Barry is a valuable asset but may need some more
managing.
