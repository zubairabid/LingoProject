Real Time Traders,

The Services Desk has sold 10 Mw of Willamette Ind. energy, Balance of the
Month, to Avista/WWP, On Peak,  beginning 12/4 through 12/30. The energy is
unit contingent power  at the WWP system. I have placed copies of the tags
and oasis requests in the Services Books.

I have purchased PacifiCorp Firm transmission to move from the Willamette
Busbar to the BPA system interconnect. Then Snohomish network transmission to
move from PacifiCorp's system to Avista's system.

I have requested that Willamette give Enron a phone number to allow us to
communicate Real Time with their generation staff. I will pass this along
when it's received.

Although the schedule is unit contingent I would like to make a reasonable
effort to keep the schedule whole when Willamette has unit problems. If we
can show that this energy is a reasonably reliable energy source it will open
up future opportunities. If there are curtailments call Pac Transmission at
503-251-5230, Snohomish Transmission at 425-304-1620 and WWP at 509-495-8534
and inform them of the cut and whatever resupply source that maybe used.

Feel free to call me at home (503-579-1615) or on my Cell (503-807-2826) if
there are ever any questions.
