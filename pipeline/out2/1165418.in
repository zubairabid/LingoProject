The following 2 applications will go for approval during Wednesday's Board
meeting.

Subscriber
ACE Capital Re International Ltd. - a subsidiary of the current Primary
member ACE Guaranty Re Inc. (formerly know as Capital Reinsurance).  ACE
Capital would like their own membership.

Shell International Limited - Oil company (Shell argues that if Mobil Exxon
and BP Amoco are Subscriber members then they should be allowed as well.
Currently, we are evaluating some Subscriber firms to be upgraded to Primary
in 2001 which would include Mobil Exxon, BP Amoco, Cargill and El Paso.)
