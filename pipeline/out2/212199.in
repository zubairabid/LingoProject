On 3/30/2000, FERC issued an order accepting InPower's market based rates
schedule that would permit entities that own generation to meet their own
loads or for back up purposes (IPPs) to sell power at market based rates to
InPower (on a profit share basis).  InPower made the filing stating it
estimated that IPPs in MAIN (and, specifically, Wisconsin) could supply a
substantial portion of the summer energy shortfalls (FERC did not limit
ImPower to IPPs in MAIN).  InPower did not name any specific IPPs; however,
to be eligible under ImPower's program, an IPP must control generation
primarily for the purpose of meeting on-site demand or providing back-up
generation and have such generation located on its premises or premises
approved by the local utility.  Further, the generation must be capable of
producing electricity either synchronous with the local utilities' grid or
commensurate with agreements with the local utility.  Total sales made by
IPPs in ImPower's program would not exceed 1000 MW/ hour.  The IPPs are in
businesses other than the sale of electricity and are simply seeking
"incremental return on the often-unused capacity of their generation assets."

When an IPP participates in ImPower's program, it becomes subject to FERC's
jurisdiction as a "public utility."

Jacksonville Electric Authority (JEA) protested ImPower's filing stating it
allows retail customers to arbitrage retail and wholesale power markets by
purchasing power at average, embedded cost retail rates and simultaneously
using their generating facilities to sell power at wholesale to ImPower (at
peak times).  FERC addressed JEA's concerns by saying that the IPPs cannot
violate any rules and requirements properly imposed on the retail sales made
to those suppliers.

This order allows ImPower (as an aggregator) to make the required quarterly
filings for the IPPs and the IPPs do not have to apply for separate market
based rates authority.  The are some additional reporting requirements FERC
waived for the IPPs: accounting and reporting, issuance of securities and
interlocking directorates (an affidavit is still needed).  I do not know if
the IPPs are still required to become Exempt Wholesale Generators (EWGs), but
will check on that.  EWG approval takes 60 days (plus filing preparation
time).

The Enron Industrial group may want to consider making a similar type of
filing.  Please let me know if you would like a copy of the filing or order.
