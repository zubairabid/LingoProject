David:
On #1, I would say the problem is not with the calculation part, but with
the market information, or lack thereof (i.e., illiquidity). The gas desk is
responsible for the supplying prices and volatilities. It is upto them to
decide how they want to account for illiquidy: change the bid/offer spreads
accordingly, or add hedging costs, or something else. And on the
correlations, they do matter but not as much as volatility or price. Since
these are correlations for the same underlying at the same location across
time, I think we can make some reasonable assumptions and compute them.

Regarding #2, I don't agree with the concept of a market top. What the desk
does with the options is to hedge them. And the way to hedge them is hedge
teh delta and exercise the options optimally at the same time.

Finally, I don't think we can use a 2-year swap as a proxy for a 10-year
swap. Longer term prices and volatilies are driven by the cost of production
and economic variables and their uncertainities. Those don't necessarily
reflect the shorter term issues.

Have a great Thanksgiving,
