Both the swap and termination confirms look fine to me.  The only question I
would have for you in on the swap confirm.  On page 6, there is a transfer
provision at the bottom of the page.  I don't know what the transfer
provision in Section 7 of the Master Agreement is, but I just want to be sure
that this does not allow them to freely transfer their obligations under the
agreement to a non-affiliate.  I know that the trade has been terminated, but
I just don't want any bad precedents being set.  This language may be just
fine; I just wanted to be sure.  Otherwise, it looks good to me.
