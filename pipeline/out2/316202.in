FYI - Attached is a memo I prepared for Dave Wear.  Dave was going to edit
the memo and send it to Simon Halfin as a summary of our discussions on the
Hub Agency Agreement.  I am not sure what the final form was, but I expect
that it was very close to the one attached.  Please do not acknowledge
receipt of this memo as Simon does not know that I prepared it.  Dave spoke
with Simon on Friday and is planning to meet with him this week.  They will
be available to talk with us after their meeting.  I will keep you posted on
when this happens.

Thanks -

Gregg
