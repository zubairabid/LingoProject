I am sure that all of you have seen the notice sent this morning from
Charlene Jackson, Managing Director of the Associate and Analyst Program.  I
wanted to follow up with a note to all campus team MDs and IT team members to
clarify any confusion surrounding Super Saturdays and technologist recruiting
for the Global Technology Track.   Although the Global Technology Track is
part of the Analyst and Associate Program - we will NOT be participating in
the Super Saturday events listed below.  Technologist candidates will be
brought into the office for a FRIDAY office visit.

Super Saturdays were first initiated for commercial Analyst and Associate
recruiting because many Enron representatives were not able to leave their
desks while the market was open during the workday.  Bringing candidates in
during the weekend works well in this situation because Enron representatives
can fully participate in the office visit and candidates can still see the
office.

However, many technology VPs have suggested that seeing Enron "alive and in
action" during the week would be a high selling point for technologist
candidates.    Therefore, we have opted to have Technology office visits on
Fridays.  The first three office visits are listed below:

November 10th
December 1st
January 19th

We will be sending out more detailed information on how you can become more
involved with technology office visits.  I apologize for any confusion.
Please feel free to contact me with any questions or comments. 3-3589.

Thanks,
Ashley
