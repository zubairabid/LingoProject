Chris - did you ask Kate who helped with the Bug deal.  Even if they are not
the ones for CES, at least they could be at the meeting and help us iron out
the issues we will face here.  Please let me know.
Also, a side note:  we received the proxy schedule from Melissa, but I'm
curious if you all have discussed the ending balance for March.  Out of
curiousity, are they withdrawing right now?  Are they near their required
minimums or well below?   We need to verify all of this so that we know what
we're working with when we start doing storage for our own account and use.
