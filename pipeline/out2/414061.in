Michael Corbally just wanted me to confirm the following with you.  Per the
list of Datasources you sent me, for France we've got Meteo France listed at
the Paris address.  We had a confirm earlier this year using Meteo France
where we used their Toulouse address.  I just wanted to confirm that the
address we want as the standard address will be the Meteo France out of
Paris, not Toulouse.  If you'll just confirm that for me.
