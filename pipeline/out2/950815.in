Vince,

Our goal is to validate that the Enron Global Market book
administrators are accurately using the "spread option model" as developed by
the Research Group.    To determine this, we would like to provide you with
the inputs for a particular deal (as provided by a Global Markets book
administrator) and have you recalculate the deal value.   We will then
compare your results to the values calculated by Global Markets.

Two Koch deals have been chosen due to their substantial P/L effect.  I have
attached the deal data in two forms: (1) the spread option model that Kara
Boudreau, Book Administrator EGM, provided and (2) an excel spreadsheet that
isolates the 2 deals.

If there is anything more that we could provide, please don't hesitate to
call me at  x30968.

Thank you so much for all of your help.

Gillian
