Nobody in my shop has seen any of this.  I'm not sure what Rick is doing with
Skilling, and I am not in a position to respond to the outcome of their
meeting.  Eric Gonzales needs this ship, or at least play the card with
either British Gas or BP/Amoco for fuel to supply the spanish plant.  Eric is
frustrated as well, and nobody has done any economic or commercial study on
the exmar option.  I'll phone Bergsieker and see what I can find out.
Thanks.

Jeff
