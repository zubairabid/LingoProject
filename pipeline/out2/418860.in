All of the counterparties on today's list are ESP's, so I will approve them
for all financial products.  If the aren't ESP's I would not approve them for
financial products including Australian financial products.  Further, if they
cannot meet the ESP test on their own, i.e., they are relying on a parent
guaranty or a letter of credit to make them an ESP, I would approve them for
all financial products, except Australian power (but they could trade weather
per our earlier emails).
