This morning the FERC had its meeting to discuss events in California and
the FERC,s response to them. The following is a summary of the remarks of
the  four Commissioners and the major points of what has been ordered:

Major features

1. Proposes to replace ISO and PX boards with independent,  non-stakeholder
boards.

2. Continued significant role for the presidents of PX/ISO, who  should be
made voting members.

3. Elimination of mandated buy-sell requirement for the IOUs  (although no
explanation as to whether this requires CPUC action). Over-reliance  on spot
markets has been problematical.

4. As an independent exchange, the PX will be free to design the  products
desired by the market.

5. The proposed price modification measure will be a temporary  measure.
Single price for all offers below $150. However, no bid above $150 will  set
the price for all generators. A seller can bid anything it wants. Allowing
generators to receive their as-bid price will allow high-cost generators to
participate in the market. However, the generator will be required to
provide  confidential reports to FERC explaining the necessity for bids over
$150 through  12/31/02.

6. The order requires forward scheduling of 95% of an scheduling
coordinator,s schedule, with a penalty applied for deviations which exceed 5%
As  an incentive, the proceeds of the penalties go to the schedulers who
comply with  the tolerance band.

7. Rejects the purchase price caps proposed by the ISO. The order  would
eliminate the ISO,s price cap authority.

8. Beginning 1/1/01, the prospect of refunds will be available.

Commissioner Hebert

Due to a technical problem when I called in, I heard only part of his
remarks. He announced that he will have a separate concurrence in the order,
but  is troubled by some of its features. The $150 cap is questionable,
whether  described as a "Soft cap" or as a "hard cap."
His concern is that it will  clearly discourage new investment in generation.
He therefore recommended that  the $150 cap should be escalated on a regular
basis (perhaps every six months)  until it reaches at least $250.

He points out that the ISO and PX are required to make RTO filings to FERC
on 1/16/01. These filings should address the major aspects of the Order
issued  today.

Hebert also questioned the issue of refunds, alleging that it was
"disingenuous" to suggests that refunds were a possible remedy.

Commissioner Breathitt

Breathitt announced almost all of the foregoing major points of the  orderThe
order is based on a market approach. "In choosing our market-based  approach,
it is our goal to guide the markets to self-correct and not  re-institute
command and control regulation. "We have all worked too hard,  too long, to
have this result."

Commissioner Massey

Sixty-five years ago, the Congress decreed that prices had to be just and
reasonable. There is no exception for market-based approaches. He will
concur, as the order does find that prices have been unjust and
unreasonable.  The order does insure that prices should return to being just
and reasonable.  Cited Frank Wolak as proposing there ought to be an 18-24
month forward product  designed which the CPUC will years ago federal law
dictated that prices had to  be just and reasonable.

The $150 is a "soft cap" and allows a generator to bid above it, but if  it
does, it will not set the price which other generators receive. He invites
comments on this issue.

With regard to retroactive refunds, the Office of the General Counsel  has
prepared a legal memorandum which concludes that the FERC probably does not
have authority to order refunds retroactively for any date before October 2,
2000. Invites comments on this issue.
California needs new generation and  transmission and the siting authority
belongs to the state. California must do  its part to ensure that customers
do, in fact, benefit from competitive markets  that ensure just and
reasonable prices.
He is not yet confident that the  Commission has taken all necessary steps.

Chairman Hoecker

He strongly supports the order.

Comments are due in three weeks. This is no time to pull punches. He  cited
the San Diego hearings as indicating that California markets were,  "out of
synch with the needs of the digital economy." For FERC regulators  who are
used to corporate struggles among utilities and other large companies,  "this
was a real eye-opener."

Average citizens had no warning this was going to happen and they had  no
competitive alternatives. It was unfair to them and, "there is plenty of
responsibility for this meltdown to go around."

"If I was a senior citizen in San Diego living on a fixed income, or a  small
business owner living on a small profit margin, or a school administrator
dealing with a tight budget, the doubling of my bill would make me want my
money  back, or to at least ensure that this won,t happen again in the
future."
Many  who expected this order, expected "a lynching and the transfer of large
amounts  of money. They want us to round up the bad guys who manipulated the
market and  order the disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains. As our legal
opinion  indicates, that,s not going to happen." Today,s order offers a
thoughtful  way back to a rational basis for buying and selling power in the
West.

We are not ignoring actual or undue discrimination or actual abuses of
market power. The order makes better market monitoring going forward a
fundamental part of FERC,s proposal. If evidence of such behavior is
brought forward, FERC will act on that information. "However, we can,t delay
work on a market fix while searching for the culpable parties."

Hoecker believes that, "strong federal action is both warranted and
important at this moment." "The bulk power grid must be made to work
efficiently across the entire West."

"Competition is at risk, make no mistake about that. In view of the
California experience, several states are reconsidering or shelving plans to
implement competition." Legislators will want to retain the possibility of
returning to the old days of vertically-integrated utilities. "The
California experience has been instructive, but not helpful(to the
meandering  implementation of competition throughout the nation."

The state,s markets have not been "mistakenly federalized" as alleged  by
some. The markets are regional. California,s access to interstate power
supplies is critical, as was made evident by recent events. If we do things
right, California will not be a federal enclave designed to satisfy our
market  predilections, it will be a workable and competitive market that
benefits  consumers.

"This is a strong order. It needs to be a strong order. We expect to  have a
strong order in December, and the public needs it."
