Marlene,
I'm reviewing the amendments to the Oasis contracts that you have forwarded
to me.  I have also completed the Assignment (ENA to HPL) for the following
contracts:
ASSIGNED GAS TRANSPORTATION CONTRACTS
_______Caption:   Global Contract No:  Effective Date:_____
(1) Interruptible NGPA Section 311  96019482   2/1/99
Gas Transportation Agreement
(2) Firm Intrastate Gas Transportation   96019481   2/1/99
Agreement
(3) Netting Agreement (confirmed only)  96019013   1/1/99
(4) Interruptible Intrastate Gas   96016667   8/1/99
Transportation Agreement
(5) Parking (documented)    96016654   7/1/98
(6) Interruptible NGPA Section 311   96015445   11/1/97
Gas Transportation Agreement
The only outstanding issue is that the Netting Agreement (96019013) and the
Parking Agreement (96016654) are not papered.  In order to assign the
documents they need to be papered.  Would you please work with Oasis to get
these papered as they are the transporter. (It should be their paper).
Thanks,
