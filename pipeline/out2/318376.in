Eric,
I need to incorporate the essential parts of what Jeff Darst refers to as
Attachment 2 below (91209_14 Jul 2000_Chiller Provisions.doc) into the Change
Order, not as an attachment.  This Attachment contains specifications as to
what they are providing as well as stipulations as to how we are to install
the inlet chillers.  I need to know which are the specifications as to what
they are providing and how the scope is being changed.  I'm not concerned
with their recommendations of how we are to install the inlet chillers since
that is our scope and our liability/warranty.
Please separate out the scope items that need to be included in the Change
Order and provide me with the wording so that I may get another draft of this
Change Order out for review.
If you want to get together to discuss, please give me a call.
