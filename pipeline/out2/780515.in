PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL ATTORNEY CLIENT COMMUNICATION
I spoke with Deutsche bank immediately after my conversation with Dan Lyons.
I apologize as I must not have communicated clearly that I understood the
importance of this issue from a legal point of view.  My intent on having
language proposed was not to concede to any proposed language by Deustche but
to determine if it was possible to be assured of bringing in a significant
commitment to the syndication of the transaction as well as not create any
potential legal issues.  As this was not the case, I told Deutche that after
reviewing their proposed documentation, we could not make the change and that
they should come into the transaction and hold the entire $35MM amount and
hold that amount rather than syndicating it out the back end as initially
contemplated.
