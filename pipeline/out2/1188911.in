Just between you and me, I'm astonished -- delighted but astonished, that
they fugured their way through all of those Japanese holidays and the
aftermath.

I'm told that the advice from Japanese counsel was recieved yesterday but I
haven't read it yet.  I don't anitcipate any problems.  I can't tell from
these e-mails if they are talikng about sending out initial packets on May 11
or going live for Japanese counterparties then (all of whom must then have
already executed PAs and been approved).
