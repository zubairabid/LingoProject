As you know, Peoples has been eagerly awaiting templates (ISDA, Guarantees,
L/Cs) from Enron for the MEH JV. At this point, their credit officer is
leading the charge with People's legal department and moving forward to
create something!  I have shared that we do not want to utilize the existing
People's agreement as a standard.
Do you have templates we could give them now and explain they are under
revision?  They have wanted to begin reviewing and are now anxious.   Don't
we want Enron to lead the way for these templates?  Please advise.
