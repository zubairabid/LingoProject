Rushing Game Matchups  Here's how I see  the matchups this week. Please
note, see the cheatsheet online  http://www.cheatsheets.net/week12sheet.htm
for exactly where I rank players  and to determine who to start. Just
because one matchup may be more favorable than another, that doesn't
necessarily  mean I'd start the player with the best matchup. The matchup
info is meant to be just one  more tool in your box when it comes to deciding
between players.





Locks: These games heavily favor the  Offense

Tennessee,s Eddie George vs Brown  Defense Assuming Eddie George can get
his  injured toe healthy (and I think he can) he could have a monster game
against a  Brown Defense that,s been terrible against the rush. For the
year, they rank # 26 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB and they
rank # 27 in rushing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks.  The
Titans will likely be fired up after a stinging loss at home to the  Ravens
and I expect George to take out some frustrations on the  Browns.

Miami,s Lamar Smith vs Jets  Defense You,ll have to look awfully hard  to
find a hotter RB than Lamar Smith.  In their week8 matchup, he ran for 2
TDs and 155 yards. At the time, it seemed like a fluke but  Smith has
maintained almost that pace since then. Jay Fiedler and the passing game
provide  just enough threat to keep the defenses semi honest and Smith does
the  rest. Over the last four weeks, the  Jets rank # 26 in rushing yards
allowed per  game.

New York Giant,s Ron Dayne / Tiki  Barber vs Lion Defense As you know by
now, the Giants  running game is governed by how close they keep the game.
Coach Jim Fassell abandons the ground  game (especially Ron Dayne,s role)
when the Giants start to trail. Against a less than explosive Lions  team,
the Giants ought to be able to keep this very close if not lead most of  the
way. Detroit,s been weak  defending the run over the last four weeks where
they rank # 25 in rushing yards  allowed per game.

Indianapolis, Edgerrin James vs Packer  Defense Green Bay,s allowing 135
yards  rushing per game over the last four week which ranks them # 22. James
should continue to roll this week  against a Packer Defense that,s missing LB
Brian Williams who,s out with a knee  injury. DE Vonnie Holiday may be
limited but he looks like he,ll play and that,s some concern but I still
look  for James to romp.

Baltimore,s Jamal Lewis vs Cowboy  Defense The Cowboys gave up their 200
yard  rushing days to quick slasher RBs Charlie Garner and Duce Staley but I,
m  guessing power running Jamal Lewis (who,s almost as quick as those guys)
will be  a great play against Dallas. For  the season, Dallas ranks # 28 in
Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB. Look for him to catch the ball
out of  the backfield as well.





Prime Matchups:  These games favor the Offense

San Diego,s  Terrell Fletcher / Jermaine Fazande vs Bronco Defense  Over
the last four week, Denver ranks # 31 in rushing yards allowed per  game.
This  game smells a lot like the Denver / Bengal game to me. Winless team
comes into town with a big  power back and nothing to lose. We  all remember
Corey Dillon,s record setting day and many remember Jermaine  Fazande,s big
day rushing in the last game of 1999 against the Broncos. Terrell Fletcher
is working his way into  the mix and that,s really muddying the waters. Keep
an eye on this one and if it looks  like one of these guys will garner the
bulk of the carries, he could be worth a  flyer.



Philadelphia,s Stanley Pritchett / Darnell Autry vs  Cardinal Defense The
Arizona defense remains pretty weak  against the rush. They rank # 29  in
rushing yards allowed  per game over the last four weeks. For the year, they
rank # 31  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB. The trick is
determining which Eagle RB  will get the carries. I like  Pritchett because
he,s bigger and can bull doze his way through the Cards. I,ve been down on
Autry as I believe  you,re supposed to have the acting careerafter the
football career, not  the other way around(

Arizona,s  Michael Pittman vs Eagle Defense  Watch this one closely as
Pittman is struggling to get healthy with  bruised ribs. If he can go, I
like  the matchup this week. Philadelphia  ranks # 30 in rushing  yards
allowed per game over the last four weeks. They,re stronger over the year
where  they rank # 18 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB. Thomas
Jones is in worse shape with  pneumonia so Pittman has incentive to get out
there.

Buffalo,s  Sammy Morris / Shawn Bryson vs Chief Defense  Morris battling a
bad ankle and looks to be a game time decision. Bryson is plenty capable if
he can,t  go. The Chiefs are an attractive  matchup as they rank # 28 in
rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks. They rank # 27 in
Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB for the year.  Watch this one
closely to see if the Bills offer hints to who,ll they,ll  go with.

Green Bay,s  Ahman Green vs Colt Defense With Dorsey Levens out again,
Green will be asked to carry the load  The Colts are vulnerable to the rush
ranking # 24 in rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks. If
Brett Favre can play, that,ll be a  nice boost for Green as the defense won,t
be able to key on stopping the ground  game.

Cincinnati,s  Corey Dillon vs Patriot Defense How much would you rely on
Scot  Mitchell if you were Dick LeBeau?  Me neither. Whether it,s  Akili
Smith or Scott Mitchell under center, it,s still the Corey Dillon  Show. New
England has shown itself  to vulnerable against the rush ranking # 23 in
rushing yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks. Dillon knows he
needs to carry the team  and he,ll do his best. His success  will depend on
how effect Mitchell can be in drawing the defense,s attention  toward the
passing game.



Even Matchups: These games  feature no real advantage either way

San Francisco,s Charlie Garner vs  Falcon Defense  Charlie Garner
continues his great season against a Falcon team that,s playing better rush
defense than it had been. For the  year, Atlanta ranks # 30 in Fantasy
Points allowed to the opposing RB but over  the last four weeks, they rate #
19 in rushing yards allowed per game. If they,re without WR Terrell Owens
again, Garner will be asked to carry a little more of the load, something he,
s  gladly done all year.



Pittsburgh,s Jerome Bettis vs Jaguar  Defense With the WR shuffling going
on in  Pittsburgh, I think Bettis is really the only Steeler worthy of
starting in most  leagues. He,s a solid performer  though that should have
another good day grinding the ball out. Jacksonville ranks # 18 over the
last  four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game. For the year, they rank
# 20 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB.  It,ll be power football
as the Steeler just line up and try to run over  the Jaguars.

New England,s J.R. Redmond / Kevin  Faulk vs Bengal Defense The Bengals are
tough to  predict. For the last four weeks,  they rank # 17 in rushing yards
allowed per game and for the year they come in  at # 14 in Fantasy Points
allowed to the opposing RB. But they absolutely shut down RB Emmitt  Smith
last week. I look for Redmond  and Faulk to have moderate success against
this improving unit. Redmond is questionable with ribs so  keep an eye on
this one.

Chicago,s James Allen vs Buccaneer  Defense As with the pass defense,
Tampa  Bay is good but not quite as dominant as their reputation. For the
last four weeks, they rank # 16  in rushing yards allowed per game allowing
106 per game. For the year, they rate # 9 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the
opposing RBs so it,s not like they,re invincible. With Shane Matthews behind
center and  scaring no one though, it could be a long  day.

Washington,s Stephen Davis vs Ram  Defense As is so often the case, the
Redskins could be forced to abandon their running game if the Rams jump out
early. Washington would dearly love  to establish Stephen Davis on the
ground but they may not be able to if they,re  forced to play catchup. The
Rams  rate # 15 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed per game.
For the year, they check in at # 23 in  Fantasy Points allowed to the
opposing RB.  Even with Bud Carson helping coach the defense, they can be
run  upon.

Atlanta,s Jamal Anderson vs 49er  Defense Jamal Anderson continues to make
solid improvement and he seems close to his 1998 form to me. He,ll face a
49er Defense that can  definitely be run on. Over the last  four weeks, they
rate # 14 in rushing yards allowed per game but for the year,  they rank # 29
in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB. Not unlike the situation with
Washington, the running back,s success largely hinges on the ability of the
defense to hang tough. Anderson can  be taken out of the game if the Falcons
can,t hold Jeff Garcia and company down  in the passing game.

Minnesota,s Robert Smith vs Panther  Defense I,ve said for years I,d love to
see  Robert Smith play a full season and now we,re seeing that could look
like. He,s having a great year and I think  he,ll continue to have success
against Carolina. They,ve been pretty strong lately  against the rush
ranking # 11 in rushing yards allowed per game over the last  four weeks but
for the year, they rank # 24 in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing RB.
If the Vikings can  control Carolina,s Steve Beuerlein (no small feat), it,ll
help Smith,s chances  immensely.



Downside Matchups: These games favor the  Defense

Jacksonville,s  Fred Taylor vs Steeler Defense Fred Taylor is beginning to
work  his way out most Fantasy GM,s dog house as he continues to be a bright
spot on a  team without many bright spots.  He,s been running hard but this
will be a real gut check for him as he  squares off against a very tough
Steeler rush defense that,s only allowed 2 TDs  over the last four games.
Pittsburgh ranks # 3 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the  opposing
RB and Taylor will have his hands  full.

Carolina,s  Tshimanga Biakubutuka vs Viking Defense Biakabutuka remains
very  questionable with a bad toe and the Panthers don,t sound very
optimistic about  him playing Sunday. Keep an eye on  it as he was able to
play through the pain last week. Although it seems to be worse this week
than last. If he can,t go, you,ll  see undrafted rookie FB Brad Hoover get
the start. Don,t ask me how that happens. Minnesota is decent against the
run  ranking # 12 over the last four games in rushing yards allowed per game
and # 17  for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.

Tampa Bay,s  Warrick Dunn / Mike Alstott vs Bear Defense Most people
including myself  thought new offensive coordinator Les Steckel would involve
Mike Alstott more in  Frank Wycheck type roles. Hasn,t  happened yet but it,
ll be interesting to see if they start getting the big guy  the balls in
creative ways. I,m  sure his fumbling problems are still a huge concern but
of course that,s not  something a guy like Tony Dungy talks very publicly
about. The Bears are decent against the run  ranking # 9 over the last four
weeks in rushing yards allowed per game but for  the year, they check in at #
21 in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.

Denver,s  Terrell Davis vs Charger Defense  Davis scared everyone this week
when it was reported he had a problem  with his calf. He says it,s
overblown and was calling it just &tightness8 below the knee. He,ll need to
be as healthy as possible  this week as the Chargers have been playing strong
rush defense of late ranking  # 2 in rushing yards  allowed per game over the
last four weeks. For the year, they,re still ranked # 15  in Fantasy Points
allowed to the opposing RB reflecting some of their earlier  struggles. The
Broncos desperately  need Davis to shoulder the load with Brian Griese out
and it,ll be interesting  to see how he responds. It,s a  tough matchup, but
I bet he does well.

St. Louis, Justin  Watson vs Redskin Defense The good news for Watson is
that  he doesn,t have to worry about Trung Canidate. The bad news is Robert
Holcomb saw a  good bit of work at tailback this week and Marshall Faulk is
even making noise  about playing Monday. Faulk did  practice some Thursday
but coach Mike Martz still remains pessimistic about him  seeing much action
this week. Keep  an eye on it as I,m sure it,ll be a top story but right
now, he doesn,t look to  be a big factor. The Redskin rush  defense is solid
ranking # 8 over the last four weeks in rushing yards allowed  per game and #
6 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing  RB.



Defensive Slam Dunks: These  games heavily favor the Defense

Cleveland,s Travis Prentice / Jamel  White vs Titan Defense  The Browns
catch Tennessee at an awful  time as the Titans are coming off a frustrating
loss at home to Baltimore and  will likely be looking to vent some
frustrations this week. Cleveland looks to bear the brunt of  that
situation. Prentice and White  have been unexceptional lately and I don,t
see them improving against a tough  Titan Defense. Over the last four
weeks, Tennessee ranks # 7 in rushing yards allowed per game. They also rank
# 7 for the year in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.  These guys
may do in a pinch on other weeks but I don,t see it this  Sunday.

Detroit,s James Stewart vs Giant  Defense Stewart is still a starter in
many  leagues but I don,t like his matchup here.  (Although you can,t
discount the time he ran wild on Tampa Bay with an  awful matchup too) The
Giants rank  # 1 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB.
For the last four weeks, they rank # 6  in rushing yards allowed per game.
That,s strong. Having a  healthy Jason Sehorn back will help the entire
defense as it allows more safety  help to commit to the run.

Oakland,s Napoleon Kaufman vs Saints  Defense Keep an eye on it, but at
this  point Tyrone Wheatley is looking very questionable with not one but two
bad  ankle sprains. His most recent  sprain is thought to be worse than the
first sprain on the other ankle that was  limiting him already. Kaufman
struggles a bit as the sole RB and Saints are RB Killers. For the year, they
rank # 4 in Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB and over the last four
games, they check in at  # 5 in rushing yards allowed per game.  One ray of
hope for Oakland is that DT Norman Hand is questionable with  bone chips in
his ankle although they believe he can play even though he hasn,t  practiced
this week.

Kansas  City,s RB committee vs Bills Defense  By now you probably know
better than to risk starting any RB wearing a  Chief uniform. This week,s a
good  week to follow that rule as the Bills are playing excellent rush
defense. They rank # 4 over the last four weeks  in rushing yards allowed
per game and the rate # 5 for the year in Fantasy Points allowed to the
opposing RB. I shy  away from Chief RBs against any team but especially a
defense this tough. If you don,t have any choice, Kimble  Anders will get
the &start8 but expect to see plenty of Tony Richardson and  Frank Moreau.
Richardson in  particular does a nice job receiving the ball.

Dallas,  Emmitt Smith vs Raven Defense Let,s put it this way: Smith was
shut down by Cincinnati last  week. And the Ravens are a just a  tad bit
better than the Bengals when it comes to run defense. If anyone can bounce
back, it,s Smith  but last Sunday was very worrisome.  The Ravens are flying
high after a huge road win at Tennessee. He,s still a solid RB but Smith
will  have his hands more than full Sunday.  The Ravens rank # 3 in rushing
yards allowed per  game over the last four weeks and for the year they rate #
2  in Fantasy Points  allowed to the opposing RB.

New York  Jets, Curtis Martin vs Dolphin Defense I don,t  see a repeat of
the week 8 meltdown from Miami on defense. Martin will have a tough day
ahead of  him against the Dolphin defense that ranks # 10 over the last four
weeks  in rushing yards allowed  per game. Over the  season, they rank # 8
in  Fantasy Points allowed to the opposing RB. The Dolphins were hopeful LB
Zach Thomas  could return but that,s not looking too likely now. It,ll be
even tougher for Martin if he  does.

New Orleans  Jerald Moore / Chad Morton vs Raider Defense  New Orleans
catches a tough break as the new RBs are forced to make their  first start
facing the # 1 rush defense in rushing yards allowed per  game over the last
four weeks. For the year, they,re not quite as tough  ranking # 12 in
Fantasy  Points allowed to the opposing RB. It,s tough to call right now how
the  carries will be distributed as the Saints are understandably being
tight  lipped. I expect Moore to carry  most of the load to begin with.
He,s the more physical back and much more like Williams than is Morton  who
falls closer to the scat back / 3rd down guy mold. I can envision something
similar to the  rotation New England is using with J.R. Redmond and Kevin
Faulk. For FF purposes, you,d of course like to  see one guy take over but I
don,t see that now. The other wild card is newly signed  Terry Allen who
sounds excited about football again. We,ll see how quickly he can get
comfortable.
