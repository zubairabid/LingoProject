On a going forward basis, can we add the type of corporation or entity the
counterparty is into the "Corporate History" drop down in Lotus Notes (like
Delaware corporation, North Dakota non-profit electric cooperative
corporation, Texas state agency, or whatever).  It helps me and some of the
non-US lawyers with their approvals for EOL..

Thanks!
