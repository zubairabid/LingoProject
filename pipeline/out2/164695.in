Yesterday, PG&E sent out by emailthe attachedadvice letter  filed last
Wednesday, 2057-E, which proposes toimplement revisions to all  electric
rate schedules and preliminary statements to change the Company,s rates  and
to bill customers based on PG&E,s flawed contention that the AB 1890  rate
freeze has ended. Based on accounting entries in its Transition Cost
Balancing Account (TCBA), PG&E says it completed recovery of its transition
costs sometime before August 31, 2000, thus ending the rate freeze.

This advice letter and the accompanyingtariff changesare said  to be filed
in compliance with D.00-06-034, D.00-03-058, and D.99-10-057 in the
Post-Transition Electric Ratemaking (PTER) proceeding (A. 99-01-016).
However, I believe it conflicts directly with the end of the rate freeze
mechanism which was specified in that proceeding.

The August date for ending the rate freeze is based on the valuation of  PG&E,
s retained hydro assets of $2.8 billion, as included in the Company,s
Generation Asset Balancing Account ("GABA") filing effective June 23, 2000
as  filed in Advice Letters 2048-E and 2049-E, dated October 26, 2000.
Based  on current market conditions PG&E believes the actual value will be
determined to be higher than $2.8 billion. If this is the case, the rate
freeze will have ended earlier and the tariffs contained herein will be
revised. If the actual value of such generation is lawfully determined to
be lower, PG&E says it will not seek recovery of any resulting
undercollected CTC.

This should be protested as it is an obvious effort to get out from under
their current purchased power undercollections at the expense of their
ratepayers, by making a spurious claim that the rate freeze has ended.
There is no date specified for comments, but assuming the usual 20 days,
that  means protests are due on December 12.
