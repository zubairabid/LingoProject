Dear Mark (back from South America?)
I received this email from Donna Greif.  It explains the sources for her data
which she puts on EnronOnline every day.  As best I know, Mark, we don't have
any agreement with any of these people for content that we place online.
I'm not too concerned about the weather (it's from the Canadian and American
governments) but I am concerned about the NGTL data and the data we get from
Telerate.
We have a disclaimer Online for the NGTL data, saying that it's our
reproduction and not a representation of what they have on their own site
(their own site which can be accessed through a password only!), but I think
this proves, rather than refutes, the fact that we're redistributing their
data without a right to do so.  The same applies for Telerate--we don't even
give them recognition--we just post their numbers on our site.
I know you're a busy man, and I'm sure you're dealing with things like
lawsuits against Enron by South American governments, or something like that,
but this issue should (a) be dropped, because you believe that it's really
not that important or (b) resolved, becuase you think it is.
Please tell me how I can help, or if we should let this issue drop.  If I
don't hear from you, I'll assume that you don't think it's an important issue.
Thanks
Jay
