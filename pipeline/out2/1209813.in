Thanks again Carol.  This will be such a help.  The credit contact is John
Suttle who is now in Australia and I will forward you he worksheets under a
sep email.  I don't have any of the contact details for the customers at hand
but what I suggest we do anyway is after you get one done, if you send it to
me, I will send it to the commercial person and they can then send it to the
bank etc. (and apologize for our delay and say some other nice things and
they reestablish the relationship), asking the persons responsible for docs
at the bank to address all their feedback to you, copying me.  You will then
have your email link with the right persona t the bank.

Sound OK?
