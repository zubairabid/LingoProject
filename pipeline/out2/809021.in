I know you all get sick and tired of people asking you for fund-raising
money, so I promise this will be the only time for me.  (Hopefully it's less
intrusive for you if I ask by e-mail instead of person to person)

My son's school is participating in the Texas Marathon, which is a
fundraiser held at private schools across the state, where 100% of the
proceeds go directly to the schools.   This year is an especially important
one for our school because our building needs a new roof---$50,000!   Anyway,
the kids have to solicit sponsors and they have a special Texas Marathon day
at school where they walk, together with parents, pets, brothers, sisters and
teachers, to benefit their schools.  I would really appreciate if you could
donate to the cause.  With the Enron matching program, it really makes a
difference!  His school is very small, they keep the tuition low, and they
teach the old-fashioned way, including Christian values.  I really want to
support the school and keep it going.

If you can give anything, please let me know via e-mail and I'll come by and
collect the check, or you can just drop it by my desk.  The checks should be
made payable to Carden-Jackson School.  I need to finish the collections by
October 17 so I can get the matching forms into Enron

Thanks for your help!
