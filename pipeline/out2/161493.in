Becky, this is relatively standard "stuff" (a high level technical term, only
grasped after many years of exhaustive technical training) that we have
endorsed in several other jurisdictions (although I didn't do a word for word
comparison, it reads very similar to the requirements in play in Texas).  I
do have a couple of comments giving the DER owner some additional rights
(more commercial than technical) than the present draft allows.  Please note
that the manufacturers  of DER equipment (Capstone, Honeywell/Allied, GE,
etc) are the authorities in the technical area (such as how quick, in cycles,
their equipment can disconnect from the utility's system, etc.) and should be
carrying "Enron's water" in this regard.  If  they are not participating in
this particular proceeding, pleae let me know and I will make some calls and
see if we can get some support from them.
