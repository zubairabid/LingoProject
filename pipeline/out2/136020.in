Thanks, man, I appreciate the kind words and thoughts.  My parents arrive this
evening for a week or mirth (or is that myrrh) and merrymaking on the big

How are thing sin the heartland?  Cold enough yet?  has Nebraska bought a
national title yet, or is Florida State paying their players more?  Give my
love
to the girls.  David
