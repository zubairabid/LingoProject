PSE&G just called and want to trade natural gas online and want to make sure
that they can trade it under the GISB.  They want to amend the ETA to that
effect.  I'm not sure how we want to handle this.  Get Stacy/Jeff's approval
that their gas trades can go under the GISB, and then amend the ETA?  The
woman who called is Denise Pocius at (973) 430-8181.
