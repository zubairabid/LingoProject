Here's a mental picture for you of me when I got to the chafing part of your
email...thumbs in ears, remaining fingers covering eyes, and repetitive
chanting of la,la,la,la,la,la........

I'm so disappointed but I won't be able to join you for the "fun run" on
Thanksgiving.  I'm headed home to see the family.   I really wish you were
here right now.  You are one of the few people that would truly appreciate
how irritating this guy that sits next to me is!!!  He just asked someone how
Chi-COG-OOOO was.  How do you accent every syllable (and then really drag out
the last)???  Unfortunately that isn't nearly the most irritating thing that
he does.  I'll update you as he provides me with more stories.

As for the food in Australia...it's really not all that different from here.
I mean Sydney is a big city so they have just about every type of food.  They
have a lot of American fast food chains.  The one that surprised me though
was KFC...it's everywhere.  It's a lot more popular there than it is here.  I
guess some of the biggest differences are that they eat pumpkin as a
vegetable, and they put beets on their hamburgers, and they eat a lot of
lamb.  Lamb is about as cheap and common as chicken is here.  And they eat
meat pies....yuck.  The pastry is good on the pies but there's no flavor to
the meat...it's just greasy ground beef.  I think they still have a little
too much of a British influence in their food...they don't believe in
seasoning.

I saw quite a few good looking guys.  There was a lifesaver training course
going on at Bondi while I was there.  That provided some great scenery!!  But
then the problem is that the men don't realize when to stop wearing the
speedos!!  The young guys look good in them, but after 30 they shouldn't be
worn in public...and after 60 they shouldn't even be considered as underwear
under six layers of clothing, but they especially shouldn't be worn on the
beach!!!!  I saw one old man whose belly hung so low that I wasn't even sure
he had a suit on, and I was scared to look too close for fear of what I might
see and for fear he'd think I was interested.

Gotta go to a meeting.
