Pittsburgh v. San Diego: First and Goal

Pittsburgh, like San Diego, will soon be served by an electric utility that
has divested its generation and paid off its stranded costs. Despite these
important similarities, the different public policies implemented by
Pennsylvania and California are producing electricity markets that have
little  in common.

In the Pittsburgh area, where Duquesne Light,s distribution service
territory delivers electricity, residential customers have several choices
and  an impressive 30% have switched to a competitive generation supplier. In
the  electricity transition game, Pittsburghers have a first and goal. By
contrast,  suffering from a market which features a dominant retail utility
that is passing  through the hourly wholesale spot market price, San Diego,s
residents need a  completed &hail-Mary8 pass to escape wholesale price spikes
and a lack of  choices.

Some crucial changes, nonetheless, to the Duquesne service territory,s
transition from monopoly to competitive wholesale and retail markets
generation  should soon be made. Now pending before the Pennsylvania Public
Utility  Commission at Docket No. R-00974104 is Duquesne Light,s Petition for
approval of  its Provider of Last Resort plan (POLR). This filing may be a
model for the  nation on how to manage a transition once stranded cost
charges have been paid  off.

Also, in the boardrooms of the three main western Pennsylvania utilities
that are not presently part of the PJM power pool, utility executives will
soon  decide whether they will voluntarily join PJM. If they do not, ways of
compelling inclusion within PJM are under discussion in Harrisburg. On
expanding  PJM, there can be no compromise. Western Pennsylvania does not
currently have  and will not have a viable competitive wholesale market,
unless its service  territories become part of PJM.

If the western Pennsylvania utilities are included one way or another in
PJM, and if the Duquesne POLR is approved with at most little change,
Pittsburgh  will have the most competitive wholesale and retail markets in
the country. At  that point, rate regulation of default service could be
successfully ended as  long as widespread deployment of time-of-use meters
and appliance control  technology, that together increase demand response to
price, has occurred.

On the other hand, if incorrect decisions are made on POLR, PJM, or
increasing demand response, Pittsburgh will be on the road to San Diego. And
that is an electricity market that no Pennsylvanian or Californian should
experience.

Duquesne,s POLR transition plan would end the collection of stranded costs
from residential customers as early as February 2002. As a result, it would
provide a 17% system average and 21% residential rate cut for customers,
whether  or not they are shopping. Transmission and generation rates will
then be capped  until December 31, 2003, and possibly until December 31, 2004.

In addition to the rate cuts and caps, the Duquesne plan would increase
present shopping credits by 31% on a system average basis * to over six
cents  per kilowatt-hour * giving shopping customers the opportunity to save
as much as  another 15% off the bundled rate in effect on January 1, 1997.
Between the rate  cut and savings from shopping, residential customers may be
able to reduce their  rates by 36% when compared to those in effect prior to
competition.

Indeed, based on current price offerings, the end of the stranded cost
charge means consumers could even purchase a 100% renewable Green-e product
and  still save about 17% on their total electric bill, compared to what
customers  previously paid for fossil and nuclear-fueled monopoly generation
from Duquesne.  For this reason, the Pittsburgh market can be the hottest
renewable energy  market in the world. Aggressive public education and
marketing are all that is  needed to turn that prediction into reality.

The POLR plan, which was developed by Duquesne in collaboration with  several
interested parties, also provides more customer usage data to  competitive
suppliers and better allocates load responsibility and losses  between
competitive suppliers and Orion, the new provider of last resort.

Flags Thrown on POLR
Nevertheless, the plan is  Duquesne,s, not a settlement. Some may object to
the proposed rule that  customers not be permitted to switch to POLR service
for below-market summer  rates, although Orion insists it will not supply
wholesale power without the  protection. A second controversial component of
the plan is to permit Duquesne  to avoid a T&D rate case by allowing Duquesne
to charge four mills above the  price of POLR service from Orion, effectively
raising T&D rates by about 10%  from the existing rates that were set in
1987.

Whether or not everyone likes every part of the plan, Duquesne,s customers
would save as much as 36% from pre-restructuring rates. The new, higher
shopping  credits effectively would become the highest in the country and
encourage  greater retail competition in the service territory. It could open
the door for  new entrants, renewable products and value-added services that
genuinely compete  for customers. Pittsburgh could be the first region in the
nation to see what a  competitive market really can provide in the electric
industry.

Why Pittsburgh?
The PUC restructuring decision  in May 1998, based substantially on the
cornerstone PECO decision in December,  1997, established shopping credits
that have given the Pittsburgh area the most  successful residential retail
choice plan in the U.S. so far. Duquesne,s plan  also included its exit from
the generation business and the divestiture of its  generation assets. In
April 2000, Duquesne completed its sale of generation  facilities totaling
2,614 megawatts (MW) to Orion Power MidWest for $1.7  billion. This
successful generation auction greatly reduced Duquesne,s actual  stranded
costs compared to the projected levels.

Avoiding Interception
Even with an end to  stranded cost recovery and high shopping credits in
2002, there will be no  genuinely competitive retail market without a
genuinely competitive wholesale  market, nor a workably competitive wholesale
market without a workably  competitive retail market. Successful electricity
competition requires both  competitive wholesale and retail markets (see our
prior issue entitled  &California Bad Dreaming8).

However, even high shopping credits provide consumers with small retail
savings if power cannot economically be transmitted into the region, and
such  transmission is very limited in the tiny Duquesne control area.
Duquesne has a  large number of shopping customers primarily because Duquesne
wanted to exit the  generation supply business, Duquesne made some capacity
available at  below-market rates, and Allegheny Energy did a particularly
good job aggregating  communities and picking off customers. Only a few
suppliers compete, though, and  offer only limited savings, mainly because
Pittsburgh and the rest of western  Pennsylvania (the Duquesne, Penn Power
and Allegheny Energy service territories)  still lack a functional
Independent System Operator.

To remedy these problems and help create a competitive wholesale market,
western Pennsylvania,s utilities must join PJM, a power pool that is
independently operated and contains over 58,000 megawatts of generation.

Duquesne,s POLR filing itself drives home the urgency of requiring western
Pennsylvania,s utilities to join PJM. Duquesne directly states &there is no
liquid, visible wholesale electric market in Duquesne,s area8 and that &none
is  likely to exist in the near future.8 These statements strongly underscore
the  need for state action and the failure of policy at the federal level.

The absence of a competitive wholesale market makes the issue of basing
prices on competitive market rates one of the stickiest issues among those
working to develop the POLR plan. Duquesne correctly insists that it would
be  fruitless to move POLR service to market rates without a competitive
wholesale  market. Ultimately the plan provides for market-based POLR pricing
no sooner  than 2004 if a proceeding establishes during 2003 that a
competitive wholesale  market exists.

Yet, while supporting the conclusion that no competitive wholesale market
exists and identifying the lack of an Independent System Operator or
regional  power exchange as particular problems, the POLR filing has no
discussion of the  obvious solution: expansion of PJM to include western
Pennsylvania. Duquesne may  be willing to support this solution, if only APS
and perhaps First Energy, with  which the Duquesne system is interconnected,
would join as well. Joining PJM  would eliminate transmission rate pancaking,
avoid multiple control areas,  expand the number of generators and suppliers
serving the market, and enable new  generation, including renewable
generation, to serve the Pittsburgh area.

In the End Zone
Duquesne Light should be  congratulated for its stewardship of the transition
in its service territory and  for its POLR filing. Due to its work so far and
that of others, including the  Public Utility Commission, Pittsburgh will see
huge reductions in the costs of  electricity starting in 2002 and continuing
until at least 2004. Pittsburgh will  also be the best place to buy and sell
renewable energy in America, as  residential customers will be able to switch
to a 100% renewable power product  and still save about 17% when compared to
bundled rates in effect on January 1,  1997.

All that is a triumph of policy and will make Pittsburgh a better place to
live and work. But the biggest victory * that now can and must be won * is
in  Pittsburgh,s grasp. Winning will award Pittsburgh the most competitive
wholesale  and retail markets in the nation. But to secure the win, POLR must
be approved  with no or at most minor modifications, PJM must be expanded,
and demand side  response to price must be increased. Only then can
Pittsburgh truly declare  victory in the electric competition game.
