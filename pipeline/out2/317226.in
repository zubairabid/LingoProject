Due to Rose being out of town, I thought I would respond to a question
concerning giving notice to WestLB, and the preparation of the assignment and
assumption agreement.

The giving of written notice to WestLB may result in the equipment being
subject to the notice coming on the balance sheet.  If there is a subsequent
problem in closing, the equipment is tainted.  I believe Enron has
coordinated this with WestLB, so that the notice period can be shortened
until there is a certainty of closing.

A&K has prepared the assignment and assumption agreements in the past, and I
will go out on a limb and suggest that they conform their form for this
transaction.

We will have a couple of changes in the GE consent and assignment agreement,
based on changes requested by WestLB in connection with the TurboPark
transaction.    I'll make the changes.

Hope this information is helpful.
