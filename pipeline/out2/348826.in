My message was sent before I finished it.
I think it would be interesting to focus your attention on this interplay
--  what policy changes have meant to companies (ie the winners and losers)
and how explicit companies are about how government policy drives their
business strategy in these industries.  I also think it would be fascinating
to compare regulators' visions for the industry they are restructuring with
the reality after the fact.  I believe you would find some similarities but
also some substantial and interesting differences.
Good luck with your studies.
My best regards to Mike; I learned a great deal working for him.
