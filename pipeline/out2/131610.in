Gary,

I have reviewed your GISB and Special Provisions my remarks are as follows:

Concerning the first page,  Section 2.5 Enron prefers to be the confirming
party; Section 3.2 we will agree to Spot Standard, and Section 13.5 Choice of
Law we will agree to  New York or Texas.

Special Provisions:

1. We would agree to this provision with minor changes in wording.
2. Agree to netting again with changes to language as follows:
In the event that Buyer and Seller are each required to pay an amount in
the same Month hereunder, then such amounts with respect to each Party may be
aggregated and the Parties may discharge their obligations to pay through
netting, in which case the Party, if any, owing the greater aggregate amount
may pay to the other Party the difference between the amounts owed.

We do not agree with purposed revisions to the remaining sections.

As previously stated,  ENA will  consider use of  the GISB for firm delivery
for 30 days or less.   This of course does not apply to interruptible
service.   If you intent is for greater that 30 days of firm delivery,  I
suggest we explore use of our Master Agreement in combination with a GISB or
alone.  The  Master  cannot be used for interruptible service  thus the need
for the GISB.

Please let me have your thoughts regarding these issues and how you would
like to proceed.


Regards,
