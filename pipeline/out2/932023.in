Thanks for the update.  Good to know that the current due date still looks
likely - always give or take a week or so!  I have just returned from drill
team contest in Dallas - lots of fun and the Bearkadettes did great!  First
place in their division (super sized schools), best in category for all four
team dances, first place solo, first place duet, first place officers dance,
and two special judges awards - one for a perfect score of 100 from all three
judges on one team routine (which Meagan was in) and one for creativity and
presentation.

Keep me posted on baby news!! --Sally
