Dear Fellow Longhorn:

As Enron prepares to meet the challenges and opportunities of the 21st
century, it is critical that the best and brightest graduates from the
University of Texas continue to consider Enron as one of their most
compelling career opportunities.

While Enron,s commitment to UT is solid, we as alumni must work together to
forge stronger ties to our alma mater. Please take a role in recruiting new
employees from the University of Texas, mentoring associates and analysts and
providing financial support. Enron is pleased to match your contribution
dollar for dollar ) up to $15,000 per employee annually through our Matching
Gift Program!

If you are already contributing via our payroll deduction program ) THANK
YOU! If you would like to join the many Enron alumni who support UT, now is
the perfect time to start!  If you would like to increase your contribution
or enroll in the payroll deduction program, please complete a new pledge card
available on-line.

Community Relations has greatly simplified the giving and Matching Gift
process. Your pledge card gift will automatically be matched without
submitting a separate Matching Gifts form whether you choose to sign up for
the payroll deduction program or attach a check. Participating in Enron,s
monthly payroll deduction plan is the quickest and easiest way to contribute!
If you prefer to contribute on your own via check, please make sure that you
take advantage of Enron,s Matching Gift program by completing a Matching Gift
form.

Pledge cards and Matching Gift forms are available on-line in the &Gifts,
Grants and Giving8 section of the Community Relations intranet site
http://home.enron.com/cr/giving/university. Please forward all completed
pledge cards and Matching Gift forms to Vanessa Bob at EB2019.

Again, thank you for your support. Working together gives us an opportunity
to enrich the educational experiences of current Longhorns and ensure that
Enron has a competitive talent pool from which to recruit its future leaders.

Sincerely,



Rick Causey
EVP and CAO
