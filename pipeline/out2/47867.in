Group,

I have Blazer tickets for 11/28 (Tuesday night after Thanksgiving) against
Seattle.  I have to work and would rather just let someone else go, rather
than attempt to get the night off.  If someone wants to go to the game and
give me their tickets to another game, let me know.  I believe that Stan has
the other pair that night, and has agreed to pay for ALL beer consumed.  :-)

Cheers
Jesse
