Mr. Lay,
I hope you don't mind the unsolicited email. I am interested in founding an
internal organization, or club within Enron.  The club would require
executive support in order to be successful.  I,ve therefore sent you a high
level summary outlining the club,s objectives so that you could pass it along
to the correct executive(s) for further consideration if you think the idea
has merit. I anticipate operating this program on my own time, so the
incremental costs to the company would be minimal. Thank you in advance for
your consideration.
Fred Philipson
Name
Club Intrapreneur
Mission of Potential Organization
To nurture entrepreneurial concepts consistent with Enron strategies and
abilities, bringing them to the point of a written business plan through the
collective, informal participation of Enron employees.
Value Proposition
The club will stimulate, nurture and capitalize on the innovation of
collective individuals within the organization, serving as a catalyst for
developing businesses within Enron.
Problem Statement
Many innovative ideas abound among Enron employees, yet they largely go
unshared or if shared, go undeveloped due to the present lack of a forum.
Solution
This internal club could foster these ideas, reducing these lost
opportunities.  The club could serve as a repository of information,
referring concept development to receptive mentors that could add insight
into an idea,s development.
Overview of club services
Quarterly speakers from the business community giving brown bag seminars at
Enron.  These speakers could be entrepreneurship professors from  Rice,
venture capitalists or even entrepreneurs from outside Houston.  According to
the Rice University Executive Education Office, Rice   professors charge
$2,000/day, although many could be encouraged to speak pro bono, given their
relationship with high-level Enron executives.   These speakers can also come
from within Enron,s executive ranks, thereby further sharing knowledge and
showing support for the club.
Monthly seminar-format meetings between Enron executive sponsors and club
members to review concepts and choose those that should be   nurtured further.
Weekly, informal lunch meetings with club members discussing strategies and
ideas, assigning action items, creating goals and targets for an idea,s
development.
Intranet site containing club meeting information, white papers, topics
under discussion, links to relevant sites and an overview of Enron,s
strategic  direction, which would serve as a template showing intrapreneurs
the types of ideas Enron would be most interested in developing.
