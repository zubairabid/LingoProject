Carol,
Engage faxed us their form of Coastal Corporation Guaranty.  It is not clear
to me looking in the file what I should compare it to to make sure it is OK.
It looks like our form of guaranty, but it is not the one I sent them.  What
do I need to do here?
Also, in terms of the approved amendment, I see one in the file with some
hand marked changes.  Are those changes agreed to and is that what we should
sign?
Hope all is going well...
