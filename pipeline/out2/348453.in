Steve:  the ACE language has been modified somewhat from the original form
which you have indeed seen before but not enough modification so as to
correspond to FERC Order 2000.  The question being put is what amendments
would be necessary to the ACE language to satisfy Enron's needs given the
reluctance of ACE to either accept 1.) generic language so the Order
prevails, nor to accept 2.) exact specific language to detail precisely Order
2000.  Are there items in 2000 we could give up in the legislative language?
Otherwise, ACE believes due to their support from Commissioner Hubert and the
general political weakness of FERC, that their existing language has the
votes in Committee to in effect overturn portions of Order 2000.  ACE's
willingness to accept any changes to their language has resulted from our
overall effective strategy.  However, the question now is what precisely do
we ask for and what is the order of importance of our requests?  Many thanks.
