Good point.  Is that also Bear Creek storage?  The tax bill specifically
states Sonat Bear Creek storage.  I also left a voicemail for our tax guy.
There is no support for the tax bill so I don't know how the taxing authority
comes up with their number.  I would like to see it but I bet it takes a
while to get the support.
I also have a tax bill for Koch Bistenau storage.  We have some type of deal
with NOPSI.  Any other ideas on that?
