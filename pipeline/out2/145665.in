Theresa,
Thanks for the email.  I'm sure Paul has spoken to you by now.... but, Paul
has sold 100% of this gas based on a Questar price for the entire month of
November.  So, we [Entrada/Crescendo] will be receiving the IF Questar flat
price no matter what pipe it flows on for November.  So, for November, it
doesn't matter to me how you flow the gas, as long as it flows.  If moving
this gas to NWPL helps you guys and doesn't cut into 100% of their gas
flowing, then I suppose you can do what you see fit.
