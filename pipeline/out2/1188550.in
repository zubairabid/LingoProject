Thanks for the feedback on the ISDA I got from Alan and Shari. I perhaps did
not put the suggested changes in the ISDA Schedule in their full context.
Recently we have received 2 ISDAs which included provisions that incorporate
by reference Australian Addendum that relate to FX, currency and interest
products and the like. Normally we only reference the Addenda that relate to
electricity and commodities. The ralionale for seeking of this alternative
ISDA form was to allow us the discretion have these provisions remain whilst
following an agreed Enron trading form. Whilst EAPL is not authorised to
trade these products we would have the flexibility to do so if the situation
were to change in the future.  By way of comparison we include provisions to
allow trading in respect of non-electricity commodities but do not do so.
Anyway as Shari and I discussed perhaps it is better that we drop the
amendments to produce an alternative Australia ISDA with a broader scope.  l
