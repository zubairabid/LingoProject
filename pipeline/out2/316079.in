Sheila,

I just realized that this is at the same time as our GE conference call.  Can
we adjust the time of the GE call?

I have a feeling that Roger's presentation is the generic mark-to-market
stuff, but I could be wrong. I just don't get the feeling that it is directed
to the lease accounting rules and other stuff specific to Turbine Torture.
Do you have any follow up questions from last week you want me to ask?

I'm expecting a draft of the ABB facility agreement tomorrow.  A & K really
dropped the ball on that one, although I wish I had expedited them more.  I
still haven't heard from Kent, despite email, voice mail, and calling Lee.  I
hope he is ok, because being non-responsive is not Kent's style at all.

Did you see that Moby Dick (aka, GE) is swallowing another big fish
(Honeywell).  I heard it increases their size by a third.  So I guess the 800
pound gorilla is now a 1066 pound gorilla. (ok, I admit I used the
calculator).

Talk to you soon,

Kay
