Thanks for the kind thought, Jeff.
I've done a bit of work on the plan you sent - take a look and see if
suggestions make sense to you. I particularly would like to see agreement
among the team on a way to prioritize projects (A, B, C or whatever) and also
on using team consensus to determine same. As noted, Paul should be the final
arbiter if the team gets "stuck."
After you review and finalize the plan, I'd like you to send final to Paul
for his review and approval (or he may want to discuss with you) and a copy
to me as well. I think the next step will be for you to present to your team
mates to get their buy-off and help them understand the process. An obvious
option is to share with and get the reactions of your team mates before you
send to Paul. I leave that choice in your capable hands!
Let me know what goes on - and let me urge you to move on this quickly - I
think Paul would appreciate your efforts.
Best Regards.
