Tana:
The following CPs are not authorized to trade US power products:
The Ridge Group LP: Declined by Credit
Unit Corporation: Restricted by Credit
Upstream Energy Services Co.: Restricted by Credit
US Steel Group, a unit of USX:  Not a current CP/not FERC approved
***********************************
Ameren Service Company: They are OK to BUY only  US power products from Enron
in the manner in which they were doing before they asked to have their
password revoked several days ago.  This entity is not FERC approved, and
thus should not be selling power to us.
Thanks,
