Online Energy Exchanges*the next step
We,ve seen the explosion of online energy marketplaces, we,ve seen the
implosion of the dot com revolution, and we,ve seen the early steps towards
the consolidation of the online exchanges.  We,ve seen independence t outed
as the key to online success and we,ve seen the big energy companies come
back and throw their weight around the online world.  The next step is right
around the corner ) and it,s going to the reintegration of onlin e exchanges
back into energy companies.

In the past two years millions of dollars have been spent on developing
online exchanges by entrepreneurs, publishers, and finally, the energy
companies themselves.  Hundreds of exchanges have popped up as a result
ranging from procurement to commodity marketplaces.  A few of them have
developed the liquidity they needed to stay afloat, and a few have sound
business plans that suggest they might be able to stick around until someone
bigger buys them up.  The majority are still in the dreaded &planned8 stage,
have been unable to attract the liquidity they need, or are still trying to
work out how to keep all of their numerous founding partners happy and
playing nice with each other.  None of them have seen the promised big
profits or even figured out where they,re going to come from.

The most successful of the exchanges, ones like Enron have been successful
because they depend on their internal inventories to provide liquidity. Where
they won,t be successful is in the larger picture when simply trading energy
isn,t enough, because they don,t have the scope to provide the financial,
information and hedging services that are key to the industry.

These realities point us to the key to a successful online exchange*taking it
in house.  Develop a vertically integrated exchange, create alliances with
information and financial providers, and force your suppliers to come to
you.  This model will cut costs, outsource non-core competencies and most
importantly save on the hassle (both in terms of costs and time) of
integrating numerous IT and cultural systems.  The key to making the most of
the online marketplace is in choosing who will provide the technical backbone
and who will provide the auxiliary services.

Perhaps it,s time we all woke up and realized that the e-business revolution
is nothing more than a new business tool and we start treating it as such,
rather than the be-all, end-all.









Is the key to a successful online exchange really taking it in house?

Chasing the E-Dream
No one can deny that the Internet has changed the fundamental way we look at
and handle information but, there is a large, overlooked barrier that will
have to be breached before the Internet truly becomes ubiquitous, the
executive suite. In the past eighteen months the average company has gone
from spending a few thousand dollars to put up a web site to investing
millions to become immersed in e-commerce. This activity has not gone
unnoticed by the inhabitants of the boardroom with an eye on the bottom line.

Until recently the business community and the energy sector in particular,
has had a tendency to treat all things &E8 as a stand-alone activity. In an
attempt to bring the top dogs into the fold, IT staffers are changing their
mantra, when addressing the CEO, from B2B (business )to- business) to...
