Jeff,
I am seeking your advice/assistance on an issue with PG&E at San Francisco
State University.  The attached message indicates that PG&E in unable to meet
our schedule requirements for the installation of meters on our generator
relocation project at SFSU.  We have been working since April to try and
ensure this problem would not occur.  PG&E has consistently either not
responded or been slow to respond.  When we did hear back from them, they
always assured us that there would be no problem, but they never made firm
committments in their responses.  Even now they are not providing firm dates.

The delays they are causing will create substantial customer satisfaction
problems, and subjects us to Liquidated Damages of $850 per day.

I have a call into Bob Kinert at PG&E to inform him of our mutual customer
satisfaction issue.  I am hoping he will be able to take action to improve
the schedule.  What steps do you reccommend if Bob is of little or no
assistance?

Thanks for your timely support.
