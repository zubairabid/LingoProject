Ladies and Gentlemen,
Due to unavailability of conference rooms on the 44th floor I have reserved a
conference room on the 19th floor from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM.  The room number
is 19C2.  I realize some people might not be able to attend, so please let me
know and I will e-mail you a summary of the discussions after the meeting.  I
would also like to suggest that we make this a regularly scheduled meeting
and have it bi-weekly or monthly.  This will allow everyone to share their
opinions and knowledge to direct or redirect our efforts based on the market
situation.  Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions.
Thank you.
