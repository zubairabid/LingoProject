Scott,

As I preliminary answer, this language hasn't been approved by Deffner's
group, although it is based on language they have seen before.  It was my
understanding that you wanted to keep this deal off their radar screen, as
you didn't want them entering into the structuring picture until later.  We
can ask for a blessing on the language, but that will probably lead to
questions about how the deal will be structured, etc.  I am happy to access
the resources in their group, however.

FCE hasn't seen any of this language.  It was something I pulled together for
you to look at.

As for FCE's desire to assign in case of merger, etc, I think the language is
too broad.  In fact, I think assignment by them should require our consent.
Otherwise, it needs to be conditioned on the acquiring party to be acquiring
a bunch of stuff:  the know how, the patent rights, the manufacturing
facilities, etc.  If they are going to merge with another company or sell
their shares, they don't need an assignment clause, unless there is something
peculiar in Conn. law.  They only need assignment language for an asset sale.
