Bill,
I will be happy to follow up on this.  But I think we at least need to
consider the ramifications of entering into brokerage agreements with brokers
who accept non-cash credit from their customers.  If they are willing to
offer credit to Enron, they are bound to do so with others.  Enron's
funds/accounts will be pooled with all other customers in the event  of a
financial crisis at the broker.  To the extent the broker has granted credit
to unworthy trading partners, Enron could have exposure if those partners
default, thus causing this financial distress at the broker.
I don't wish to overblow this concern (i.e., focus excessively on low
probability events), but I think we should at least discuss it a few minutes
before we proceed.
