I will revise the documents to reflect Flagstaff and the items we discussed
at the meeting previously.
Kevin's email indicates he wants to remove the language concerning a party
obligations to refund the costs of the interconnect paid for by that party,
if the other party is unable to maintain their pressure obligations.
Does this need to stay or be removed?  If this needs to stay, should someone
tell Kevin that it will remain in the agreement ?
