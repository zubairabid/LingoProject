Alrighty. Here is a complete look at what we have 'pending' with Alagasco.
I'm expecting a call back next week from Amy McEntire (Alagasco's attorney)
in regards to further instruction on what to do with the stragglers
(outstanding deals). Based on my conversations today, it appears that
Alagasco is showing these deals on other CES contracts (contracts for which
we are encountering a volume constraint), if we can verify this via
confirmations (Jennifer Blay is currently researching) then the issue will be
volume constraints rather than term dates. TAMMI, can you verify if deal #s
242653 & 271301 are CES deals or ENA deals (there are no notes relating there
back to CES)? If they are ENA deals, we should be able to move them over to
the 'new' (9/1/99) Enfolio contract without the same tangles we are
encountering with the CES continued deals. Also, can you confirm that these
deals are not bound by a demand fee? Reason, the CES contracts stipulate
demand fees (as listed on spreadsheet) - - - - - if the deals are ENA & do
not have demand fees associated with them - - - - - - then they do not belong
on the CES Ks and moving them should be easier (assuming that we are able to
explain this to Alagasco as this will change the Confirming party & trigger a
confirmation being sent to their offices). DAN, does all of this sound right
to you? Depending on how Amy & Roger view things - - - - - - the move may
just be a ENA booking issue. I'm a bit fearful that they may use this as an
opportunity to renegotiate the demand fees associated with these long term
deals. In addition, if they decide to allow the deals to ride on contracts
where we encounter a volume constraint - - - - - - I'm assuming that they
would initiate an amendment to reconciliate the contracts with the
transactions. If they do not initiate - - - - - guess that will be a bridge
crossed when we get there?
Anyhow, TAMMI, I hope the spreadsheet helps if Roger should call before I
hear from Amy. DAN, I'll let you know the volume issues as soon as I get my
hands on copies of the confirmations that should have been sent by Alagasco.
Depending on who gets contacted first - - - - - please let me know if
anything new pops up.

Thanks all!!
