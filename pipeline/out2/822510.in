You need to speak with Reps from Exxon and Highland.  Ask them about their
Lone Star transport allocation.  They had to transport the gas on Lone Star
to sell to us.  So, Lone Star should have given them an allocation on their
transport deliveries at that point (or their supplier's contracts) to match
the sale volume.  Adjust our purchase amount from each party based on the
transport allocation.
