I have asked my assistant, Jan King to schedule a dial in conference call
with you all tomorrow morning to go over the Palo Alto situation.  I am
trying to understand the history of the ISDA and Gas negotiations over
authority so that, as the late comer to the party, I don't tromp all over
their sensibilities (which I think I may have already done)   In the physical
power group, we approach the issue of getting proper authorizations from
cities along the lines set forth in the documentation below.  This is the
perspective I will be bringing to the conversation and look forward to
efficiently deciding on how to procede with all agreements with you all
tomorrow.
