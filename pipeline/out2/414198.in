For online trading I am also going to have to sign off on whether we can
trade with the UK based counterparty list, and I am probably going to need
your help and your list to be able to do that.  I am totally unfamiliar with
the UK based counterparties and in most cases their names aren't even in
English so I can't even guess whether it would be an appropriate counterparty
or not.  I am, obviously, most concerned about not approving trading with
utilities and governmentals.  I've been searching that utility website trying
to figure out which are utilities from that, and guessing at the names if it
sounds like a utility or governmental.

Is your list done, or when will it be done?  Do you spell out if the
counterparty is governmental/utility?  What help can you give me?
