Good Morning!

If I understand correctly you need the paths for the flexfiles for fair value
& equity earnings.
Fair value templates are located O: Stfin/Acctng/Sap Finance/Gl upload
template

The equity earnings templates are saved where their respective  EE schedules
are kept because they are linked.
I thought it would be easier that way.

Co. 914 & 915 EE ---O: Stfin/Acctng/Jedi2/Entries/CS-914-915-EE
Co. 957 & 961 EE ---O: Stfin/Acctng/Enserco/EqEarn/2000EqEarn/CS-957-961-EE
Co. 398 -----O: Stfin/Acctng/Jedi/EE schedule/CS-398EE

Let me know if you have any questions.
