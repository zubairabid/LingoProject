Jeff - just brief comments:
1) I'd like MRW to affirm that this revenue does not have to be grossed up
for federal income taxes.  Usually revenue requirement does have to get that
gross-up.
2) the 7% discount rate presumes securitization, is that correct?  So we need
to be clear that we are assuming securitization.
3) the percentage increases from other states is shaky.  These were in some
cases isolated utilities and not reflective of how much lower their rates are
to begin with.
