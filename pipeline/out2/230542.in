Sara:
There is more and more interest amongst our custoemrs in the West in looking
at Swaps.  I want to be able to show them how the ISA contract fits together
with the credit support annex and confirmation letter.  I have built a pro
forma Cofirrm based on the SoCal Water deal you worked on with me.  Can you
make a pro forma master and credit support annex so we can fax or e-mail
these to potential clients so we can try to get their interest and encourage
them to get contracts and credit in place with us?  I know you are hesitant
to do this, but it would help our marketing significantly.
Thanks
Chris
