With respect to Commercial Risk Re-Insurance Company, a Bermuda company,
although they are being sent thru to specifically open them for weather,
Brent Hendry says I can't open them up until we review their Memorandum of
Association (like their articles of incorporation) to confirm that nothing in
them would prohibit this type of transaction.  Can you contact whomever sent
you the Password Application and ask them to fax their Memorandum of
Association to us.  Thanks!
