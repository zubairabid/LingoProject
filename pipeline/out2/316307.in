Hi Jordan,
I support ENA's Chicago group in their activities with Peoples.  Peoples and
Enron have a jointly (50/50) owned company called enovate, which will be
involed in managing some of Peoples assets and some trading activities.  Each
of the parents will be establishing a line of credit to cover cash flow.  It
is expected that Corp will be lending the money for Enron's part, and Sarah
Wesner has been involved in the process.  Therefore, I thought it would be a
good idea to run this transaction through your group for
blessing/comment/sign off/whatever is appropriate.  I can give additional
information to whoever you decide should take a look at this.
Thanks,
