The title transfer fee is much like Michcon's in that if you move gas from
one marketer to another such as Columbia Energy Services to TXU instead of
nominating directly to the end user themselves they charge you a title
transfer fee.  TXU is the agent for Dahlmer Chrysler who is CES' end user
customer.  Therefore if Columbia were able to nominate from their pool
DIRECTLY to Dahlmer Chysler  they would not be charged the title transfer
fee.   However since TXU is there agent and CES has to nominate to TXU
(marketer to marketer) they are charge the fee.
