Jeff,
Who is handling the PG&E hydro auction?
I have a concern about PG&E Generation's participation in this auction.
Every press release from PG&E on this topic goes out of its way to state that
PG&E Gen will be a bidder.  My concern is their access to non-public
information and how this may skew the results of the auction.  If you're the
person on this, let's talk.  If not, pls let me know who is.  Hope you're
doing well.
