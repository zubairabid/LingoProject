What would you do if: Your child care provider calls in sick? The
stay-at-home parent in your family is ill? You are at a loss for what to do
with your children on school holidays?

Enron recognizes that parents often experience a conflict between the demands
of their jobs and those of parenting. That conflict is especially apparent
when your normal child care arrangements fall through and you must make a
choice between staying at home and being at work.

Starting August 1, 2000, Enron will offer back up child care as part of its
commitment to managing work and family life for its employees. Knowledge
Beginnings offers a solution for those days when you have an unexpected
problem with child care. For only $20 per day, your child will enjoy a
variety of age-appropriate activities supervised by full-time, dedicated and
trained staff. The center will serve children ages six weeks through 12 years
and is located at 777 Clay Street.

The following activities are designed to provide you with opportunities to
learn more about this benefit:

Brown Bag Lunch (EB 5C2) July 19  11:30 - 12:30
