Vince --
Please feel free to also call Jeff Dasovich (415-782-7822) in our San
Fransisco office.  He has been very involved in the California market
discussions and presented before FERC during their field hearings.  He knows
the profs you are meeting with and has some great insights into our positions.
Jeff also attended Berkeley as an undergrad and is now attending their
B-school in the evenings.
Thanks.
