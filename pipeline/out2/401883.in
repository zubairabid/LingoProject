Team,  thought you would find this somewhat interesting
andexplanatoryofCalifornia's  near term panic . Our  California
Commission is predisposed to do almost anything to stem the  tide of higher
energy prices. Their latest manifestation of complete melt-down  comes in the
form of attempting to modify electric QF payments by abandoning the  current
gas index methodology utilized by all three utilities. Essentially, the
proposed decision wouldimmediately (effective 12/1) abandon the old
California border gas indexes in favor of adopting a "proxy gas price".
This new proxy gas price would apply to all three utilities, PG&E, SCE and
SDG&E. On a temporary basis, the gas index used for eventual electric QF
payments will be an gas index consisting of ( i ) 10 % of the simple
average of three border indices at Topock ( Btu Daily, NGI, Natural Gas
Week)  and (ii ) 90% of the SoCal Gas Core Wacog published monthly in
Schedule  G-CS or (in the case of PG&E) 90 % of their core published WACOG .
The  resultant reduction in electric QF payments is several hundreds of
Millions of  dollars just for December alone.
So  what if anything does this mean to TW ? Clearly, TW's short term desk
maybe be affected. If Cal border numbers run 14 - 20 dollars and power
payments  are based upon PG&E Wacog of $7.50 gas demand for electric
generation  will moderate. Next, the heat level on the cause of why basin to
border  price spreads are over $10 is not longer just a Commission vs.. EPNG
issue. The  entire California QF population becomes a huge stakeholder. The
never ending  search for a "bad Guy" escalates. TW needs to be carefulfrom
becoming  painted with a broad brush. TW is not one of the Southwest bad
Guys. TW's pipe  is not oversold, is point to point firm, widely held, useful
to California's  utilities etc.
If any  of this is useful and you want to further explore to potential
ramifications,  please call . Mark, IGS
