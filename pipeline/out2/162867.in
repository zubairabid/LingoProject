I am trying to find out if anybody knows anything about USI Corporation.
They are a rate hawk out of San Juan Capistrano, CA. (So Cal).
They have approached Albertsons, who we are currently working with, about
entering into an agreement with them.  They are promising a 15 - 20% savings
($4-5MM) for their stores in SDG&E territory, just by putting them on another
applicable utility rate that nobody is aware of  "loop hole".  Of course,
they will not share this information until Albertsons has signed a contract.
The contacts we have been negotiating with have told them to get lost but USI
went over their heads to senior management who is now asking for an
explanation.
From a commodity origination and account management perspective a rate hawk,
if hired, is just going to cause problems.
Any information that anybody can provide on:
1.  The Company
2.  There pitch in CA
3.  More specifically, their possible "loop hole or play" in SDG&E territory,
would me much appreciated.
Please forward this message to anybody that might be able to help.
Is there an SDG&E interuptible tariff or a new ISO interuptible tariff that
can generate this kind of savings?
Thanks,
