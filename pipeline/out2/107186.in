Andy:

I wanted to let you know where we were on incorporating your changes to the co-marketing agreement.  Drew, Ted and I have been through these, and they have all been addressed or incorporated except as set forth below.  Please give Drew or I a call if you have any questions; we will circulate a revised draft of the agreement when I receive it from Ted.

On your item #6, we deleted "subdomains" from the definition of Enron Web Site, but included successor sites if the successor site is Enron's primary electronic marketplace for the Specified Product.  We are making this agreement binding on Kiodex' successor, and Kiodex will certainly require that they have the benefit of this deal if Enron does something like changing it's name.  However, this definition wouldn't pick up any other Enron website unless it became the "EnronOnline" for the commodity that Kiodex was generating the report for.

On your item #7, the point that neither Enron nor Kiodex guarantees the accuracy or completeness of the data or reports will be addressed in a number of provisions, including limitations of liability provisions and agreements with Enron customers that will be entered into when they access the program (but that we have not yet drafted).

On your point #10 (regarding striking Kiodex right to use the Enron Market Data (the end of day mids) to generate indices, etc., we have deleted that, but we expect Kiodex to raise it again in negotiations.

On your point #16, because of the other limits we have on the data we will provide and how Kiodex can use it, it really doesn't work against us to call it a worldwide license, so we left it alone for the time being.  Kiodex only has the right to run the Kiodex reports for Specified Products, which are NA gas and crude and refined products, and products that we subsequently agree to include.  A worldwide license gives Kiodex the right to run those reports from a server located anywhere in the world, but only on data from customers that trade those Specified Products -- it would not give Kiodex the right to data or to run reports for Enron customers worldwide, or for Enron products that are traded worldwide.  As a result, a German customer that trades NA gas could get a Kiodex report for NA gas, but a US customer couldn't get a report on SO2 allowances and a German customer couldn't get a report on a product traded out of London (unless we agreed to add those products).

On your second set of comments re: no ads for competing platforms, as we discussed, we have included a most favored nations clause that if Kiodex promotes Enron competitors on their site, they will give us comparable placement on their site.  This is what we gave to Kiodex if we promoted their competitors on our site -- comparable placement.

Re: non-payment by Kiodex customers, we are defining a Qualified Customer as one that accesses the Kiodex site through the Enron site, or one that finds out about the Kiodex site from Enron (and we have audit rights to determine if customers told Kiodex they heard about Kiodex from us), or Enron customers that send us the release form to allow us to electornically transmit data to Kiodex.  What level of revenue those customers generate for Kiodex or how long their relationship lasts does not affect whether or not they are a qualified customer.

On the term, this will be a big deal point that we should all discuss in some more detail.  We are leaving it as a five year deal for purposes of this draft for the following reasons.  First, it was always pitched to Kiodex as a five year deal, and just changing that in the document without some pretty substantial pre-discussion with Kiodex will really create some fireworks.  Second, since we are making such substantial changes in the deal anyway because of the accounting issue (trying to book all of the income on the equity investment in Q1) that we are probably going to have to go back to the table on a number of things, and might be able to work out a different term as part of the overall
negotiations.

As to our equity if Kiodex terminates the agreement, we are providing that we keep the entire 12.5% and the warrants vest 100% if we terminate the agreement because of what is effectively a Kiodex breach of the co-makreting agreement that would include Kiodex terminating the agreement without a specific right to do so, like an Enron breach).

Here is the revised co-marketing agreement (clean and redlined to reflect your comments as well as Drew's):
