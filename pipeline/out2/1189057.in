Jay -
Thanks for your note.  This definitely falls into the "(b)" category.  The
problem is that there are sooooo many things in the b pile already that I
can't tell you exactly when this will be resolved.
Having said that, I agree that the weather information is probably the least
risky, but it might be helpful if you were to visit their sites and see if
there is any comment about further use of the information posted there.  As
for the others, a little additional information would be helpful.  For
instance, I know we were in discussions with NGTL at one time and were
unwilling to sign the letter they asked for.  Was there ever any follow-up
with them on that?  Is there any correspondence at all (it doesn't have to
look like an official contract).  Is the Telerate information also available
from other sources?  Is it possible that Telerate gets it out really fast and
that is their advantage but others are right behind with the same or very
similar information?  Do we have an agreement of any kind with Telerate
regarding the services they provide to us?
Thanks for your help and continuing attention to this - I agree we should be
trying to do this the "right" way.
