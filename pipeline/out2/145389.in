Joan, Gerald;
What is the game plan for November nominations?  Do we want to go through
the same deal as before and nominate on NWPL, get rejected, and renominate
on Questar?  Or, do we want to nominate on Questar and include a statement
that we are nominating on Questar only because of last month's ordeal?
Tom Brown and Wildhorse are supposed to close today - if they didn't get
their late last Friday.
