Team,

Another great meeting this month!  Thanks for your participation.

Please mark your calendar for our next Vision and Values meeting - Wednesday,
August 16 from 9am until noon in eb 46c1.

Below summarizes the key points from our July 19 meeting:

Communications Training
Feedback from I&I continues to be positive.
The number of vp's and above not enrolled in Executive Impact and Influence
increased to 111.  The increase is the result of cancellations.
We had a discussion about what the "quantifiable penalty" would be for vp's
and above who DID NOT participate in the Executive Impact and Influence
training.  I continue to research this issue.  I hope to have an update at
our next meeting on August 16.
Work continues on the development on Executive Impact and Influence II.  The
design of this one-day training session is slated to be completed by the end
of August.  The plan is to conduct the first training session by the end of
September.  P&D training will be included in the course curriculum.
Development of the on-line communications course continues working with
Cognitive Arts with a target completion of year end.  V&V Task Force members
will receive a call from Cognitive Arts to provide input into the design of
the course.

Communication Tools
The updated PeopleFinder and ExpertFinder are on schedule.  PeopleFinder
should be available at the end of July and ExpertFinder should be available
by mid-September.

P&D
Work continues to roll P&D out in the new Enron tool, ThinkBank.  Initial map
sites for drop down content on the P&D flowchart are being developed.
Facilitators are currently being identified throughout the organization.
We need all V&V Task Force members to communicate with their business units
about using this tool when appropriate.

Communication Campaign
Additional products continue to be distributed throughout the Houston Enron
building with interesting Enron facts.
Targeted international offices received their Vision and Values posters.

Diversity
Dick Liebert reported that questions for the ETC survey are currently being
developed.
Three additional Diversity Focus Groups are being held to include the
perspective of commercial employees.
A meeting of the entire Diversity Task Force is scheduled for Sept. 26.

Best Companies Survey
Mary Clark and team completed Enron's application and forwarded it to Fortune
on July 25.  Keep your fingers crossed!

That covers the high points of the meeting.  Please let me know if you have
additional information to share with the group.  Beth and I will see you
August 16.
