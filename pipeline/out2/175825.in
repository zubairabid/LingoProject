4th set of suggestions from scott  You were missing answers to the other
questions.  Attached are the proposed answers.
Comments to Davis regarding some Speculated Solutions 1)
State could build generation:
The real issue is not who builds but that generation gets built in
California.
Any generation that is built in California will reduce problems because it
will displace load.  Displace load will cause lower demand which in turn will
result in lower market prices (new supply/demand balance).
Our proposal, RFP of 10,000 MW, will allow all kinds of proposals including
ownership by government, to explore.
It is okay for the government to build generation but it should not result in
any different outcome than anyone else building.
Output of existing generation at cost
Output of existing utility generation should be sold at cost.
Utilities that caused the mess should not benefit.
All customers, including those being served by other suppliers,  paid for
these utilities when they were below market.  They should get their share of
benefits of the existing assets now at cost.
Municipal utilities could be required to sell their excess generation in
California.
The problem we are incurring are related to government intervention (i.e.
price caps and illiquidity) causing uncertainty that causes California
utilities to desire to sell outside of the state.
Removal of price caps will keep municipal generation in the state.
There is no need to mandate that it stay within California.
State universities (including UC/CSU and the community colleges) would more
widely deploy distributed generation.
This solution is a great idea which is included in our pitch.
As indicated, we are advocating a CPUC process of RFP,s that would include
universities.
This is a superior method because universities are slow to act and we need
solution by summer.
Expand in-state gas production.
No comment on this specific solution.  However, Enron notes that the QF,s
have rate that are linked to gas.  The Government should explore requiring
the QF,s to buy gas forward and sell at costs, for 5 to 20 years to lock in
low costs.
The real issue related to gas is increasing gas capacity.  Any increase in
gas production in California or new pipeline into California would do much to
reduce electricity costs.  Governor Davis should ask the the California
Energy Commission to explore ways to increase gas supplies in much the same
manner suggested previously for electricity.
Take state lands gas royalties in kind.
No comment aside from above.
Negotiate directly with tribes and state governments in the west for
additional gas supplies.
No comment aside from above.
Empower an existing state agency to approve/coordinate power
plant;maintenance schedules to avoid having too much generation out of
service at any one time.
This solution should not be necessary if no entity holds too much market
power and entities are exposed to market price. They will seek to maintain
their assets such that they are available in high cost times.
Generators that are paid on a fixed price basis are at risk to doing bad
maintenance timing.
Thus, a committee to review maintenance timing of QF,s, utility owned
generation would be appropriate.
Condition emissions offsets on commitments to sell power longer term;in state.
The governor should not cause generation builders more risk.
What,s important is that generation be built in California, nothing else.
Any extra risk will cause less generation to be built.
Emission trading should be made right for all generation built in California.
Condition new generation on a commitment to sell in state.
What,s important is that generation be built in California nothing else
Any extra risk will cause less generation to be built.
Securitize uncollected power purchase costs.
This is a great idea if made available to all customers.
We are suggesting that hedging be done through entities bidding on standard
offer, using the benefits of existing utility generation and securitization.
Utilities are not good at hedging so those that are good should bid on
default supplier status.
Allowing securitization of these hedging costs would allow lower rates which
is a good thing.
Either eliminate the ISO or sharply curtail its function -- he wants to hear
more about how Nordpool works(Jeff- someone in Schroeder's group should be
able to help out here).
