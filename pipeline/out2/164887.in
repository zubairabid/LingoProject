From The Economist print edition


Kirk,s enterprise

Dissatisfaction over the poor performance of DaimlerChrysler culminated in
its third-largest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, taking legal action through
his Tracinda Corporation, owner of around 4% of the car maker. He alleges
that Daimler-Benz bosses were fraudulent in claiming that their takeover of
Chrysler in 1998 was a &merger of equals8, and is demanding $9 billion in
compensation.
See article: Kerkorian v DaimlerE+

A planned restructuring at Mitsubishi Motors, a Japanese car company that is
34% owned by DaimlerChrysler, appeared to go on hold after Mitsubishi agreed
to bail out its loss-making Australian subsidiary to the tune of A$172m
($90m).

General Electric named Jeffrey Immelt as its next chairman and chief
executive. He will take over from &Neutron Jack8 Welch, who has postponed his
retirement until the end of 2001 in order to oversee a potentially tricky
takeover of Honeywell.

Qantas, Australia,s leading airline, is to spend $4.6 billion on 31 new
aircraft over the next ten years, including 12 new A3XX &superjumbos8 from
Airbus. This gives the European consortium enough orders for a formal launch
of its new aricraft. Though this is a significant victory for Airbus over
Boeing, Qantas will also buy six long-range 747s. Boeing said that sales of
its smaller 777 will exceed $18 billion this year, well ahead of similar
Airbus planes.

Creditors of Daewoo Motor, an insolvent South Korean car maker, agreed to
provide further loans of 728 billion won ($605m), after the unions had
accepted a restructuring that would include job cuts and sales of assets.
This may help to persuade General Motors and Fiat to buy Daewoo.

Glaxo Wellcome, a British drug company, withdrew Lotronex, its
irritable-bowel syndrome treatment, from the American market because of
worries by the Food and Drug Administration over its side-effects. It is
unlikely that the drug will now be launched in other countries, and it may be
withdrawn elsewhere.

Weyerhaeuser, an American forest-products company, made a $5.4 billion
hostile bid for a rival, Willamette Industries after the latter rejected an
unsolicited offer. Weyerhaeuser did not increase its price, although it may
yet be forced to go higher to beat out rivals.

Hans off

Hans Snook, the unconventional chief executive of Orange, is to step down
after the mobile-phone company floats next year. Mr Snook will be replaced by
Jean-Franois Pontal from France Telecom, which acquired Orange earlier this
year.

NTT DoCoMo, Japan,s largest mobile-phone operator, confirmed its purchase of
a 16% stake in AT&T Wireless. DoCoMo is keen to promote its third-generation
mobile technology; and AT&T Wireless, which is soon to become a separate
company after its parent splits up, needs the cash to pay for bids for
American wireless spectrum.

Lernout & Hauspie, a troubled Belgian speech-recognition software firm, filed
for bankruptcy protection after finding $100m in cash missing from its South
Korean unit. L&H,s shares were suspended a month ago after accounting errors
had been reported; its two founders have both quit the company.

Sema Group, an Anglo-French computer-services outsourcing company, issued a
profits warning that sent its shares nosediving by 44%. Its shares were hit
again when a non-executive director resigned after selling shares when
forbidden to do so by stockmarket rules. In a market rapidly becoming
dominated by large companies offering global services, medium-sized companies
are losing out.

Time, gentlemen

Cazenove, the last bastion of traditional, blue-blooded stockbroking,
announced that it would become a public company and abandon a partnership
structure that has seen it through 177 years. Cazenove, which could be worth
around o1.5 billion ($2.1 billion), is a niche outfit, but around half of
Britain,s top 100 companies are clients of the firm.
See article: Cazenove goes publicE+

Cr,dit Agricole, a mutually owned French bank, stepped in to help Lazard, an
investment bank, rid itself of an unwanted shareholder, Vincent Bollor,. He
sold a 31% stake in Rue Imp,riale de Lyon, one of the holding companies for
Lazard shares, to Cr,dit Agricole for FFr3.9 billion ($500m). Investors have
been attracted by the discounted value of the holding companies, compared
with the bank,s asset value; but they now want an unwinding of its
labyrinthine ownership structure.

Nomura, through its Principal Finance Group, is planning to lead a consortium
that will pay Deutsche Bahn, Germany,s state-owned railway, DM7.6 billion
($3.3 billion) for 114,000 flats. The Japanese securities firm will then
securitise the rental income from the properties.

Cooling down

America,s economy seems to be cooling. Revised figures for the third quarter
showed GDP growing at 2.4% (rather than 2.7%), the slowest for four years.
The Conference Board,s index showed that consumer confidence in November was
at its lowest for more than a year. And durable-goods orders fell by 5.5% in
October, after rising by 2.4% in the previous month. America,s high-tech
Nasdaq stockmarket had another bad week, falling to just above 2,700, its
lowest level for more than a year.

Growth slowed in both France and Germany. French GDP growth in the third
quarter was 2.7 % at an annual rate, compared with 3.3% in the second
quarter. Germany,s growth slackened off even more strikingly, to 2.3% at an
annual rate compared with 4.6% in the previous quarter.
