Pennsylvania's First Successful CDS Auction
An important new regulatory skirmish has broken out before the Pennsylvania
Public Utility Commission (PUC) over which company has won the right to
provide  default generation service to 300,000 customers of PECO Energy, an
Exelon  Company. This skirmish is actually good news for consumers and is the
fruit of  the 1998 PECO Energy restructuring settlement agreement, a landmark
document  that ended a ferocious regulatory war when all combatants signed
it.
The &peace treaty8 includes a requirement that PECO Energy bid out default
service for 20% of its customers, and PECO has done so. Green Mountain
Energy  Company is now challenging PECO Energy,s decision that New Power won
the auction  to provide the settlement,s mandated default service.
Both Green Mountain and New Power are offering those 300,000 consumers  small
rate reductions compared to customers receiving default service from PECO,
and more electricity generated from renewable energy resources.
Specifically,  New Power and Green Mountain are offering generation service
to Rate R  residential customers for approximately 5.54 cents per
kilowatt-hour. That offer  is 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour less than PECO
Energy,s unbundled generation and  transmission rate of 8.65 cents per
kilowatt-hour and 0.11 cents per  kilowatt-hour less than the shopping credit
of 5.65.
The consumer savings that these offers represent is masked or reduced by  the
stranded cost payments that consumers must pay PECO Energy. Indeed, were it
not for stranded cost payments, the New Power and Green Mountain offers
would  reduce total bills by about 3.11 cents per kilowatt-hour, or 20%.
The dispute between New Power and Green Mountain is noteworthy because it
proves that companies will compete vigorously to provide default service if
shopping credits and lengths of contracts are set at reasonable levels. It
also  shows that renewable energy portfolio standards can be met
economically.  Finally, the result of this case will switch more customers to
competitive  suppliers in one day than the total number who switched in
California over a  period of nearly three years.
When the PUC anoints New Power or Green Mountain as the winner, if all
299,300 consumers opt to stay with the CDS provider, the total number of
customers in Pennsylvania that will be served by a competitive supplier will
jump to more than 850,000. Of this total, 504,000 will be residential
customers  of PECO, a number equal to 37% of the PECO residential class.
CDS Background: In Pennsylvania, there must always be a &default8 supplier
or &provider of last resort8 to assure that service is always available to
all  customers. The incumbent utility is the default supplier, unless the PUC
decides  otherwise. The default supplier must provide generation service to
customers who  do not have a competitive supplier either because they chose
not to shop or did  not find a willing supplier at an acceptable price. The
PECO Restructuring Case  Settlement initially defined CDS service in
paragraph 38:
&On January 1, 2001, 20% of all of PECO,s residential customers --
determined by random selection, including low-income and inability-to-pay
customers, and without regard to whether such customers are obtaining
generation  service from an EGS -- shall be assigned to a provider of last
resort-default  supplier other than PECO that will be selected on the basis
of a  Commission-approved energy and capacity market price bidding process.
This  service shall be referred to as Competitive Default Service (&CDS8).8
The same approach was used in the other Settlements in the GPU, PPL and APS
restructuring cases. CDS reflects an effort to assure that there is at least
one  other large competitor in each market. CDS also has a renewable
portfolio  standard (RPS), even though there is no RPS for regulated
utilities in  Pennsylvania. The winning bidder must supply:
&(2.0% of its offered energy supply for CDS service from renewable  resources
of solar, wind, sustainable biomass (including landfill gas but  excluding
incineration of Municipal Solid Waste), geothermal or ocean power. The
renewable energy increment shall increase by annual increments of 0.5%
thereafter.8
This increasing renewable requirement continues indefinitely, meaning that
in year four of the CDS there will be a 3.5% renewable requirement, 4% in
year  five and so on. This is significant, as each extra percent of renewable
energy  used to serve the 299,300 customer block prevents approximately 950
tons of NOx,  3200 tons of SO2, and 390,000 tons of CO2 from being emitted by
fossil fuel  burning power plants.
PECO,s CDS RFP: Importantly, the PECO/Unicom merger case modified the CDS
bidding process as established by the 1998 settlement. Of particular note,
the  revisions eliminated the &customer care8 functions from CDS, made the
contract  three years long to help spread out return of start-up costs, and
instituted  several rounds of selection in the event that prior efforts
yielded no  successful CDS contract.
PECO issued its initial RFP for CDS on April 6, 2000, and Shell Energy
Services submitted the only bid. However, the PUC rejected the bid as
non-conforming and denied Shell,s Petition for Reconsideration of its
decision.  Pursuant to the modifications in the merger settlement, PECO
entered into  bilateral negotiations based on an August 24, 2000 RFP.
Three suppliers submitted conforming bids, and PECO selected New Power as
the winner on October 18, 2000. New Power is the new competitive supplier
actively marketing residential and small commercial customers in the PECO
service territory and is backed by Enron, AOL, and IBM.
PECO and New Power negotiated a complete contract that is before the PUC  for
approval on November 9, 2000. Under the proposal, PECO and New Power
expanded the size of the CDS requirement to include 22% (299,300) of
non-shopping residential customers instead of 20% of all residential
customers,  whether shopping or not. This change was designed to implement
paragraph 39 of  the Restructuring Settlement, requiring adjustments to the
numbers assigned to  CDS in order to have 35% of all PECO residential and
commercial customers  obtaining competitive generation as of January 1, 2001.
There also will be a  second round of assignment of non-shopping customers as
of October 15, 2002 if  New Power is providing CDS to fewer than 20% of all
PECO residential  customers
New Power electricity will be 2% renewable in 2001, 2.5% renewable in 2002,
and 3% renewable in 2003 as required, but does not include a commitment to
exceed the requirements or provide cleaner power for the non-renewable
portion  of the product.
The price for New Power,s CDS for Rate R customers would be 2.02% below the
shopping credit, while residential heating customers on Rate RH would pay
1.02%  less than their shopping credit. For a Rate R customer, this would
mean that  overall rates would fall .8% (as energy and transmission falls
from 5.65 to  5.54); for Rate RH rates would fall .44%. Customers assigned to
CDS may still  choose any competitive supplier, or opt out and retain default
service from PECO  without penalty or charge. New Power will be able to offer
its full slate of  energy and non-energy related products to these customers.
Green Mountain asserts that approval of the PECO/New Power contract is &not
in the public interest,8 arguing that PECO ignored Green Mountain,s offer
that  included CDS pricing 2% below the shopping credit for all residential
customers,  including those on residential heating or off-peak service. Like
the New Power  proposal, the Green Mountain proposal would lower Rate R and
RH rates .8% and  .44%, respectively. Green Mountain asserts that the New
Power rate cut for Rate  R is only 1.83%, and not 2% and argues that its
product is better for the  environment because the non-renewable portion of
the product would come from  natural gas and hydro instead of system power
generated primarily from coal and  nuclear fuels. If not declared the winning
bidder, Green Mountain proposes in  the alternative that both they and New
Power receive CDS contracts.
In response, PECO states that all three bidders had the opportunity to
submit revised bids and that the Green Mountain revised bid was not
submitted  until October 12, 2000, 13 days after the deadline and nine days
after the  selection of New Power as the winning bidder.
The PUC will sort out the facts and arguments on November 9. Some think  that
the PUC may very well split the 300,000 customer block between Green
Mountain and New Power.
Whatever the result, customers in the Philadelphia area should receive yet
another small price reduction, more renewable energy, and the opportunity for
a  more competitive electricity market.
