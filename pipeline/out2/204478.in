Michelle, I thought I would pass this along to make you aware that now EOG
isn't going to supply the EFM at their new location.  Given that they have
yet to contribute the funds requested for our efforts, I don't think we
should spend the money to put measurement out there until they send us the
$10,000.  Maybe we should ammend the interconnect agreement to change the
estimate back to the $30,000 we originally requested.

Thanks, Bob
