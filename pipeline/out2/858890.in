Effective November 21, 2000, there will be a new procedure for lunch.  EOL
traders and deskheads will eat first.  Then, your assistant will notify you
when the rest of the traders can eat.   This new procedure is to ensure the
EOL traders will not be away from their desk a long period time during
lunch.

Thank you for your cooperation.
