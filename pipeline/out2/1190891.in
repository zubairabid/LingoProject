PLANNING CREATIVE LAW FIRM RETREATS
By Daniel J. DiLucchio and Shannon Prown
Over the years, retreats have been used for a number of purposes, including
business planning, strategy development, consensus building and positioning
reassessment. While the primary function of retreats formerly was strategic
planning, law firms have discovered a variety of other reasons to hold them.
General education, entertainment, continuing legal education, management
education, personal and professional skills development and other areas of
interest to the members of a firm are some of the retreat topics in favor of
late.
Careful planning and the articulation of clear objectives are the keys to
conducting successful law firm retreats or off-site meetings. Yet, for those
responsible for planning the retreat agenda, constantly developing new ideas
is a challenge. The following table of topics is provided to assist retreat
planners in designing creative, challenging and productive programs. The
general content or concept intended, the general format of the session and
potential sources to present the program are also included. This list is not
intended to be an exhaustive account of every possible topic. The purpose is
to generate some new topic ideas.
The following chart depicts some of our latest thoughts on retreat planning.
