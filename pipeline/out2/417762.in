Tana,

The WAPA would like to know if there is any more  information that they need
to provide.  Would you please check if there are any serious legal issues
with their application?

Also Doug Helleckson (406-247-7383) mentioned that he would like to add
language to the PA, where it says..."This Password Application will be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New
York. "  They want to add, "...and also the Federal Government".


Thanks,

Noel
