International Inc. (OTC-BB: "SNMM")("Starnet"), a leading provider of

gaming industry reported on its December 8 special shareholders meeting. The
special meeting of shareholders was adjourned and continued to 10 a.m. local
time on December 21, 2000 at the Royal Antiguan Hotel in St. Johns, Antigua in
order to establish a quorum and to solicit additional proxies on the proposal
to
reorganize into a U.K.-based parent company.

difficulty with the voting procedure are asked to contact Starnet Investor
