Anthony,

Attached is the proposed confidential settlement letter agreement.  I am
still trying to get confirmed that we have the correct Enron Metals entity
named, so you will see blanks.  I am also sending this to others in ENA legal
for their input (if they wish to give any).  I understand that you needed
this draft today, so I am sending it to you now, despite the blanks.

Please let me know what changes you need me to make.  I will be in the rest
of the day today, tomorrow until 3:30 p.m., and all day Wednesday.

Britt
