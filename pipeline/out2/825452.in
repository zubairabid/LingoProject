Daren - Can you set up a deal for meter 7266? An accounting arrangement is
always created every month.  It is used for the Texas General Land storage
deal, (withholding 15% on their injections only).  It has been nominated in
POPS on  012-41500-05-002.  Please let me know, volume management wants to
get Bammel allocated today.
Thanks.
