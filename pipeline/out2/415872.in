After 23 years of service to Enron, Alberto Gude retired on April 30, 2000.
On behalf of the many personnel that knew and worked with Alberto, I want to
thank him for his dedication to Enron and also for his friendship and
mentoring that he provided to so many.  We wish Alberto, his wife Maria, and
their children Steven and Michelle all our very best.

Following Alberto,s retirement, the following organizational changes will
take place immediately within the  IT Compliance group.

Andrew Parsons, Senior Director, will be responsible for all Corp. IT
Compliance activities.  Andrew will report directly to me.

Mark Thibodeaux, Director, will continue working primarily on information
security evaluations and technical reviews.  Mark has 16 years of experience
as an IT security expert and ten years as a CPA.

Stephen Simpson recently joined IT Compliance as a director.  Steve came to
Enron with 8 years of experience in Arthur Andersen,s Computer Risk
Management practice.   Steve will focus on application risk management.

The Corp. IT Compliance group is responsible for enterprise wide information
technology reviews and IT risk management compliance activities.  These
activities include ensuring that our systems and related processes are
secure, available, operating with integrity and are adhering to audit
standards developed in conjunction with Arthur Andersen.

Please join me in congratulating Andrew, Mark and Steve on their new
responsibilities.
