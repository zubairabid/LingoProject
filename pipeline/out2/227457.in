We are going to use 76-0486649 for the tax id for Enron Distribution
Ventures.  This is the number of Atlantic Commercial Finance, Inc., the
parent of Enron Distribution Ventures.  See tax department e-mail traffic
below.  If the brokerage firm has a problem with this, I guess we will need
to put our tax people in touch with their legal department.  We can't undo
our tax treatment just to satisfy the brokerage firm.
