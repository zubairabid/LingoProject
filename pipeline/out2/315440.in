What could be better than a meeting on an interconnection agreement?

I know I need to organize another turn of the C&E agreement.  I'm going to
give it a look and see what open issues we might have.

PS  Isn't the weather perfect?  I thought of our friends in VA and NC with
the hurricane remnants headed their way.  Hope it isn't too bad.
