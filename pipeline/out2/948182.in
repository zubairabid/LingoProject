Stinson/Vince,

The Henwood runs for Dabhol are, at least temporarily, over.  However, the
main modeller for Henwood (David Yumigada) works out of their California
office.

It maybe worth our while to have him come and demonstrate the runs, and
explain the modelling algorithm to the larger group.

In aparticular, now that I am going through some of the comments people have
raised on the PSIM model, I think there is value in understanding the way
Henwood deals with Hot and Cold Starts, ramp up costs, and with issues of
cycling plants.

I think understanding these will help in developing the next version of the
PSIM, and will also give the group here ideas to build into existing models.
This is a suggestion, and so please let me know if you see value in this.

Regards,
Sandeep.
