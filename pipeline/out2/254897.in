I apologize for not thanking you earlier for sponsoring the INGAA dinner last
month.  I truly enjoyed the informal setting of the dinner, providing my
thoughts on energy related issues, and hearing the views of those who
attended the dinner.  Hopefully, the dinner guests received some value for
their attendance.

On another front, I hope everything went smooth for the big move, although I
missed your participation at the lunch that Ken Lay had for me and others.
It is clear that gas issues are on the back burner these days, and that
electric related matters and e-commerce are just more daunting and
interesting.  Of course, that is where the money--profit-- will be in the
future.

On a more personal note, I wish you and Debbie the best, and hope your new
arrivals will bring you so much joy.
