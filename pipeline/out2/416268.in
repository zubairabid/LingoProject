I spoke to Kate Cole and she said Enron NetWorks (I'm not sure of the correct
spelling yet) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation on 4/13/00.  She
has made me a copy of their articles of incorporation and LLC Agreement and I
am sending a messenger to pick them up, as well as a copy of the officers and
directors, which appears to have been approved.  The banking resolution went
to Julia today for signature.  Do we need to adopt any other resolutions
(brokerage, approval of agreements, etc.).  How about adoption of the trading
policy?
