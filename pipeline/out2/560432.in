Jeff,
I am forwarding information about derivatives I & II to you for your
consideration.   The Paradigm Group would conduct the training in house
around the middle of the month for your group's convenience.   We have had
prior experience with their progam and recommend them.    I don't know if the
cost is within your budget but, I understand the importance of uniformly
training your group in derivatives.
Let me know your thoughts,
hgm
