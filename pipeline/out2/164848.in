You bet.  Got your and Fran's messages.  If you'd like to discuss by phone,
I'm in all day.  Otherwise, I suggest that we do take the following next
steps:
Just as soon as you have the proposal and list of participants drafted (which
I hope will be very soon), please forward to me.
Then, as quickly as possible, I'd like to have a meeting to discuss and
finalize the proposal.  It would be very useful if Laura Tyson could be in on
that final meeting, and, of course, any other of the participants that you'd
like to invite.
We're are somewhat behind the eight ball due to the delays thus far in
getting this thing off the ground.  If we're going to do it, it's going to
have to come together quickly, and the report will have to be developed very
quickly, too.  Hope that will be possible.
I'm assuming at this point that you and I are proceeding ahead absent Mitch
and Carl, since they have sensitive issues with their clients that we can't
seem to overcome?
And I'll inquire about the need for expert witnesses in the class action
suit  and get back to you.
