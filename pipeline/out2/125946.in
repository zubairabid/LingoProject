Dan,

When we originally discussed a physical gas contract with SMUD, I mentioned
that we had sent them a contract in the past.  That is why I asked if we
could incorporate some of the language from their long term contract in order
to appear to be working with them.  Also, I was under the impression that you
were working with Shari to incorporate applicable language from the
agreements that we have come to terms with them on.  So, I guess using the
standard agreement, which is not what I requested, might have been a waste of
your time.

I understand that their contract language might be lacking and I didn't
expect to use their contract in full.  ( He indicated that SMUD used language
from one of Enron's old contracts?).  If you say that we can't use any of
their language - that's fine too.   It just seems as though you sent a
standard form without considering my requests.  I also need to be informed of
the reasons we can't use any of their language so I can discuss this with
them.  SMUD is one of the customers we have already missed opportunities with
and if we can appear to work with them - it would be to our benefit.  Legal,
as well as credit, is considered to be a part of the team that helps build
these customer relationships.  I hope we can work with them on this agreement.

Thanks,

Kim
