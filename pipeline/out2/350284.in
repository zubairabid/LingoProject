Joe Hartsoe, Rick Shapiro, or Jim Steffes can fill you in on the details of
what FERC did today.  One question you need to think about is how their
decision on price caps affects any contracts which we may have indexed to
California's spot market.  The way it reports the market clearing price will
change fundamentally if prices over 150 will be accepted but not used to
clear the market for all bids.  So, if we are using this as a reference price
in our contracts it may trigger the need to look for alternatives.
