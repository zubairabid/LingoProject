I didn't have this on my calendar, Lexi, because I wasn't on the list for
this event that you handed out regarding the recruiting strategy.  My husband
has a commitment away from home for Wednesday night, and with the children in
school already, I can't really ask the older kids to babysit for the two
year-old during prime homework hours.  Patti has some names that I have
suggested for this event and she plans to call you with those names.  Very
few of the names on your e:mail message were on the Recruiting Strategy
Schedule that you handed out, so I would be surprised if any of these folks
have this on their calendars.  You may need some of the names that Patti has
for you.
I have put the other dates on my calendar, however, and I am in the process
of lining those up with our home schedule to make sure that these will work
for me.
