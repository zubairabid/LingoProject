Constraint: Third person pronouns used in a non-specific context

More specifically: I'm analysing conversations in which:
1. A person addressing a group makes a generic reference to a single person in the group, eg: "If anybody has any issue with this, (s)he should contact said person"

Tasks:
1. Isolate emails with that context. ?? How to ??
Options: a. Message receiver > 3? I dunno, gotta set a limit I guess.
	a>ii. Mails organised by threads. Should not be of issue here, gotta look into this; whether or not context affects usage
	b. pronouns used fall under shortlist used to whittle down the sentence list

he
she
they

his/him
hers/her
theirs/them/their

(s)he

you ? (second person)
your ? (second person)
it ? (non human)
I ? (first person)


METHOD:
1. Get all emails with >= 5 recipients DONE
2. Limit conversation with pronoun list DONE
3. TODO develop heuristic to remove references to specific people



OBSERVATIONS:
1. No usage of '(s)he', 'he/she', 'she/he', 'he\she', 'she\he', 'he or she', 'she or he', 'his/her', 'his/hers',     'his or hers', 'his or her', 'her/his', 'hers/his', 'hers or his', 'her or his'. 

2. 'They/them/their/etc' is used to refer to single persons. Eg: account manager ... themselves. any witness ... their .

3. haven;t found use of she/he as generic yet
